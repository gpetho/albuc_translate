Praefatio.	Preface. 
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Having completed for you, O Sons, this book, which is the last of medical science with its complement, and having reached the end thereof from its expositions and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is surgery with the hand. 
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since operation with the hand is prostrated in our region and time utterly private, so that perhaps the knowledge of it has perished, and its trace cut off; and there remain from it no descriptions except small ones in the books of the ancients, which hands have changed: and error and hesitation have happened to them until its intentions were closed and its force elongated. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise therein according to the way of exposition, declaration and abbreviation; and that I should come with forms of instruments of the Cautery and the other working instruments, with what is done from the addition of declarations and from its hastening which is necessary.  
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	But the cause for which a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and the author thereof must exercise himself before that in the knowledge of anatomy as Galen narrated until he knows the joints of the members and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of bones and nerves and sinews and their number and their egress, and arteries pulsatile and quiet, and places of their exit.  
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And on account of that, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work it is little, and especially in the art of the hand. 
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We indeed have already spoken of him at the beginning of this book.  
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is not knowing what we said of anatomy is not purged, but rather falls into error by which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this knowledge and boast themselves thereof without knowledge and without experiment. 
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	For this reason happened to me to see a stupid doctor cut open a scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman and he cut into some arteries in her neck, so that blood flowed from the woman until she fell dead between his hands. 
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in age, and the stone was large. 
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore came upon him and extracted it along with a piece of the bladder. 
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day. 
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had already been summoned to extract it and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the sick man that he would die. 
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was receiving a fee from a certain Duke in our land for medicine: and it happened that a black eunuch who was with him suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the doctor hastily, with his ignorance, bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and strong binding straps and did not allow the wound to breathe. 
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his wishes. 
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he dismissed him after several days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained so until his leg and foot became abscessed and he came to ruin. 
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore summoned to him and I hurried to loosen the bandage and there was relief and he escaped from his pains. 
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	Nevertheless the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb and I could not restrain it.  
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Put therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until it died. 
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who perforated a cancerous abscess and it became ulcerated afterwards until the malice of it was magnified with its master. 
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	For this reason: when cancer is pure from melancholic humor then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all unless it is in a limb which can tolerate it so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason O sons, it is necessary for you to know that operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, operation which is associated with health; and operation with which there is danger in many dispositions. 
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already aroused in every place of this book, in which comes operation, in which there is terror and fear.  
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to be cautious of that and moderate it so that fools do not find a way to speak and dishonor.  
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore receive the measure with solicitude and protection, and your infirm ones with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to salvation and praiseworthy succession; and dismiss terrible illnesses of difficult healing; and lift your souls from that which makes you fear so that hesitation may enter upon you in your faith and well-being. 
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more lasting for your glory and more sublime in this world, and finally for your quantities.  
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. 
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness lest you be called a bad doctor.  
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now however I have divided this Treatise according to three Chapters. 
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On Cautery with fire, and Cautery with sharp medicine, chaptered and ordered from head to foot, and the forms of cautery instruments and tools; and all that is necessary in the operation. 
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two. 
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On incision and perforation, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows and similar things; and wholly chaptered and ordered according to the forms of instruments.  
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration and dislocation and the cure of torsion and similar things; chaptered and ordered from head to foot, and according to the forms of instruments. 
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone. 
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis. 
Pars I.	Part I. 
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Of cautery and its harm; to what constitutions it suits, and at what time; and whether with iron or gold. 
Caput I.	Chapter I. 
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the operations performed with it, it is necessary to say what are the qualities of its cauterizations and their harms; and in what constitution they manifest.  
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say, therefore, that speech concerning the quality of cautery's cauterization and its harm is a long and subtle science and hidden secret. 
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Indeed, many wise men have spoken on this subject, and they have disagreed; and it is sufficient for me to say a little from their words, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say, therefore, that cautery generally suits every constitution which is with matter and without matter; except for two constitutions, which are a hot constitution without matter, and a dry constitution without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, in the hot and dry constitution with matter they disagreed. 
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cautery is beneficial in it. 
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of that, namely, that cautery is not suitable in a disease which is from heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat; and it is inconvenient for something hot and dry to heal a disease which is hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who said the opposite of that said: that through cautery benefit is done in every hot and dry disease which occurs in the bodies of men; because when you compare the body of a man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.  
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say through his speech: because experience has already revealed that to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not fitting that he should come upon this unless he has already been proven and trained in the last chapter of the practice of cautery, and has learned the diversity of human temperaments, and the disposition of diseases within themselves, and their causes, and their incidents, and the time period of them. 
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But there is no fear over you from the remaining complexions; and especially in cold and moist illnesses. 
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have now agreed on them, and they have not disagreed on the benefit of cautery in them.  
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with a burning medicine, is because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the limb which you are cauterizing, and it does not harm another limb joined with it, except for a small injury.  
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But the action of burning medicine reaches that which extends from the limbs, and perhaps causes a difficulty in healing to occur in the limb, and perhaps destroys it.  
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows. 
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now indeed it has become clear to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with art, and steadfastness upon the truth of things, and because of that I excuse myself from the length of speech.  
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted for this book of mine, I would bring to you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies through its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses with demonstrative philosophical speech, which would agree with your minds. 
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they themselves disagree on the time in which it is fitting for cautery to be done, and they posit a better time according to truth. 
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is fitting at all times; therefore the harm which occurs because of time is submerged in the benefit, which is attracted with cautery. 
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary pains, strong, prompt, which do not tolerate delay: because it is feared that from them, a harm may happen, which is greater than a small injury incurred through time. 
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let it not fall into your minds, O sons, that which the common and foolish physicians do not fear, namely that to the sickness which is healed by cautery, there is not always a return; and they posit that as a consequent, and the thing is not as they think: because cautery is nothing but a medicine in its place, which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the causes why pains happen. 
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Truly however cautery surpasses medicine through the swiftness of its health and the power of its operation and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that sickness may return at some hour according to the complexion of the weak person, and the location of his sickness, and its power; and what is prepared in his body from an aggregation of superfluities therein; and what comes upon him in acquisition from foods and similar things from those causes unless sickness arises in which cautery is administered.  
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Sickness subtle in a limb of few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth, because of pain and similar things to it, for it is possible that the pain may not return in it.  
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases. 
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly the common saying again, that cautery is the last of medicine, is a right statement: not to that which they intend in it; because they believe that there is no cure which agrees with medicine nor with any other after the setting of the cautery. 
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The matter is however contrary to that and the intention, that cautery is the last of medicine, is not except when we administer modes of cures in some sicknesses, and those medicines do not agree: then we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it agrees; then from there it falls, that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.  
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that a cautery with gold is better than a cautery with iron, and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance; and they said that it does not make pus the place of the cautery. 
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true: for I have now proved it and found that it does not do so in some bodies without others. 
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And a cautery with it is good and better than with iron, as they said. 
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you ignite a cautery in fire made of gold, it is not declared to you when it is ignited according to the quantity which you wish, because of the redness of the gold; and when cold rushes towards it, and if you add ignition upon it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets. 
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the craftsman falls from it into occupation; and because of that a cautery with iron is made among us faster and closer, from straightness to the operation.  
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I myself have now arranged this chapter on the cautery according to chapters; and I have arranged them from the head down to the feet so that it may relieve one seeking that which he wants from it. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Concerning the way of cauterizing the head in the coronal suture.  
Caput II.	Chapter II. 
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Cauterization here is directed at the dominion of humidity and coldness over the brain; which are two causes of headache, and abundance of flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and abundance of sleep, and toothache, and sore throat: and universally every sickness which happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and those similar to these sicknesses. 
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The way of cauterization is that you order the sick person to be evacuated first with a medicinal solution purging the head for three nights or four, according to what the strength of the sick person requires, and his age and his habit. 
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then order him to shave his head with a razor. 
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands on a stool, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest. 
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes. 
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever therefore your middle finger arrives, mark that spot with a cautery. 
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then with an Olive-shaped Cautery: whose form is this.  
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it upon the spot marked with the cautery, with descent, whereby your hand is gradually constricted, and you revolve it.  
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand and look at the place. 
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that a quantity of the head equal to a small almond, or a quantity of rue, has already been exposed from the bone, then raise your hand. 
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it becomes cold: until the bones which I told you appear. 
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and soak the cotton wool in it, and place it upon the spot; and leave it for three days.  
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place cotton wool soaked in butter upon it, and leave it upon the spot until the cautery burn is destroyed.  
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with Tetrapharmakon ointment until it heals. 
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus; therefore it is better and more beneficial. 
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone; and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is hardened.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then after that which has been burned is scraped away from the bone, then it is treated.  
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary with the cautery to reach the final point until it makes an impression on the bone so deep that the bone falls out; this is done like the shape of a kirate, or an instrument which women put in infused with a small alphabet: and they think that vapors from the head exhale from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.  
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be cared for until it becomes solid. 
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But to me these two kinds of cautery do not seem at all suitable except in certain people according to the way of fear. 
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to dismiss him is better with me than his health. 
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity as we have testified in other members and especially when the head of a weak person is naturally frail; and indeed the first kind of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it: therefore operate with it in safety.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head. 
Caput III.	Chapter III. 
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head and it is prolonged in a weak person, and they use hot baths, and cooking pots, and head-wraps, and oils, and poultices. 
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things helps them, then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of a weak person is strong by nature and not frail, and they find intense cold then cauterize with another cautery under that one slightly. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize them over the whole horn of their head with a cautery so that it does not go through the skin and uncover a quantity from the bone, as we have described. 
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize them with one cautery on the back of their head in the place called "vas," which is the place where a windsock is placed, and elevate your hand in this place, and do not uncover the bone. 
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak person finds because of that intense pain, and different from the pain of all other head cauteries. 
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I say this cautery in its place and it is necessary that it be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of their head with a more subtle cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.  
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in headache, both with a medicinal burning agent and with iron. 
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV. 
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends as far as the eye, and the head is cleansed with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment, which I have mentioned in the divisions of diseases, is administered, and it does not all resolve: then cauterization is appropriate in this case according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine; or with iron. 
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine is done as follows: you take one clove of garlic, and remove its outer layers, and cut off its ends from both sides. 
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then, during a time of bloodletting, split the area of pain until a spot under the skin is made where the tooth will be held. 
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore insert it into the skin itself until it is concealed; then bind it tightly with a bandage of appropriate constriction and leave it for fifteen hours. Then loosen it and remove the garlic, and let the wound rest for two or three days; afterwards place upon it a poultice steeped in butter until the area produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed. 
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with certain burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, On Burning Medicines. 
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization of it with iron is done as follows.  
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Heat a cautery iron, which has this form. 
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a "Clauilis" because the shape of its head is like that of a key, which has a certain curvature, and in its middle there is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot and hold your hand steady; and revolve the iron gradually with speed; and let the quantity that is cauterized be half the thickness of the skin.  
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that the artery which is below is not injured and bleeding occurs. 
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a swab in salt water and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then place the swab with butter; afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed. 
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this half-skull with the second point of the cautery. 
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And be careful not to cut an artery in this half-skull, not an old one properly. 
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	Concerning the way of cauterizing an old half-skull. 
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a half-skull with what we have said from the preceding treatment and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not succeed; and you see from the illness that it is not sufficient for it what we have said from the first cautery with medicine or with fire, then it is necessary that you ignite the knife-shaped cautery until it becomes white after you have marked the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or so; and place your hand on it once, and squeeze it until you strike the artery and reach the mouth. 
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However it is necessary for you to be careful from the continuation of the jawbone, which moves at chewing, lest its side is injured or the nerve that moves it, whence a spasm occurs. 
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been severed.  
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For there is fear in its severance and especially for him who does not know what he is doing and is not studious or experienced; and he abandons the operation with it at first. 
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a remembrance of the regimen of blood flow occurring from an artery according to its own way and in its place in this book. 
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for it, and you see a weak body enduring cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, care for the wound until it heals. 
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, apply cautery, as we said in the chapter on extracting an artery with cautery having two knives. 
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more effective. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing ear pain. 
Caput VI.	Chapter Six. 
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold and is treated with solutions and the remaining care as we said in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cautery by fire: and that is what is called a point, whose form is this. 
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then points with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it revolves: or around both if pain is present in both at the same time. 
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And distance yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with cautery paste: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points in each ear, and like that.  
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the places until they heal. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cautery for a fistula. 
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven. 
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	A fistula that is treated with cautery is not except from the kinds which arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses. 
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cautery for the kinds that arise from dryness and nerve spasm. 
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this kind of fistula with solutions and poultices and gargles, and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary that you cauterize the weak person with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little below its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.  
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery opposite the weak part. 
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not happen except in the part which appears healthy. 
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of the cautery is that you cauterize it itself with the cautery in the direct extremity of the upper part of the ear under the horn of the head a little, and at another time: its length being according to the length of the thumb. 
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned. 
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery and it is a species from the kind of knife, its shape having been presented previously: however, it is not thinner than that by a little, as you see: and it must be such that the knife in it has a little superfluous thickness. 
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the places with what preceded until they are healed.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy. 
Caput VIII.	Chapter Eight. 
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes old and you treat it with what we said, and your medication does not take effect, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over all of his horn of the head, and a cautery in the middle of the head as we said, and a cautery on the back of the head according to what preceded: and let the manner of the cautery be according to what preceded.  
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also, it is cauterized with a cautery over the mouth of the stomach and it is the last resort. 
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for it with what preceded. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in oblivion.  
Caput IX.	Chapter Nine.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that first strong hyssop be given to the sick person in a drink, and pills which purify the brain. 
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the entire head of the sick person and place on the back of his head a plaster of synop as described in the treatise of plasters, and apply it several times. 
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is the method of cautery; and do it according to the same order that I said there. 
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it heals thereby, it is good. 
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make for him three cauteries on the posterior part of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and put a finger's breadth between each cautery.  
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for the cautery as was done before. 
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you wish an addition, and the weak person can tolerate it: then make a cautery for him in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	But if you wish an addition: then cauterize it above the two horns. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for it until it heals; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form that was given before.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening. 
Caput X.	Chapter Ten.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hyssop, and with what we said.  
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery above each horn of the head, and with a cautery above the back part of it, and with three above the vertebrae of the neck.  
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you are occupied in the illness with softening of the body by many of those things and the sick person is able to tolerate it and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and last of all with a cautery until most of it is burned from his skin, and lift up your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it heals; and thus the olive-shaped cautery.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in epilepsy. 
Caput XI.	Chapter Eleven. 
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized unless he whose epilepsy is from phlegm.  
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore it is necessary that you cleanse his brain first with vinegar, and with the remaining treatment which we mentioned in the division; when he is a large invalid, or tolerant in the reception of medicines. 
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleaning chews are administered for the brain, before that for many days with improvement of food. 
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner; and with another cautery on the back of his head, and with a cautery over all the horn of his head. 
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	But if the invalid is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I said in the one having paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck, and the vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive according to the manner which preceded. 
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	But if the invalid is a child, then place a subtle cautery according to this manner. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	On the manner of cauterizing in melancholy.  
Caput XII.	Chapter Twelve. 
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we said in the one having paralysis. 
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity inclined towards melancholy, and the body of the invalid is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the head of the invalid, and afterwards make a well-made tourniquet from linen, like a circle. 
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head; and the invalid sitting upright must be held from every side.  
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the liniment. 
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is more fitting to make it from old sheep's butter. 
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a fire with temperate heating, which the finger can tolerate when immersed in it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate it in the middle of its head in a circle, and leave it alone until it becomes cold. 
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do that to the weak one once a week, with the rest of its good regimen, until it is healed. 
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on it, except that which you hold with the cautery: let there be a smell. 
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with quality. 
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then put a swab soaked in butter, or chicken fat on top of it.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	On the method of cauterizing descending to the eye in water. 
Caput XIII.	Chapter Thirteen. 
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the beginning of water is declared to you in the eye by the signs which I have said in the division, then begin and make the weak one drink, with that which cleanses its head. 
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep it from all dampness, and make it sit in a bath, fasting for several days.  
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then order it to shave its head, and cauterize it in the middle of its head. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it above the two temples with two cauteries, if there is a beginning of the descent of water in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if there is a beginning of water in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cautery be long in width to the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.  
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	For if you see anything from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting, and caution against the flow of blood.  
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries lastly produced. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	On the method of cauterizing old tears.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter Fourteen. 
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When tears of the eyes are old, persistent, and are upon the veins and arteries which are on the exterior of the head manifest, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery as I have described in the beginning of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck beneath the two bones. 
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if it does not yield with addition, then cauterize it on every side cautiously above the eye, upon the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	Concerning the way of cauterizing in a foul smell of the nose. 
Caput XV.	Chapter Fifteen.  
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with what we said in the division and medication does not work; then hurry, and give in a drink three nights of infirmocochias; then shave its head and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive oil cautery. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a clove cautery two cauteries, above the two eyebrows a little under the hairs.

Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the form of a clove cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	Concerning the way of cauterizing in relaxation of the eyelid. 
Caput XVI.	Chapter Sixteen. 
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye is relaxed from illness or humidity; then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.  
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every side; and they are elongated from the two temples; and let the length of the whole cautery be according to the lengths of the eyebrow; and do not stop your hand with the cautery, but rather according to the amount that is cauterized as a third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the shape of a cautery according to this method of a lunar cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing an eyelid when the ingrown hairs are stinging the eye.  
Caput XVII.	Chapter Seventeen. 
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	A cautery is done in two ways: either with fire or with a burning medicine.  
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	But in a cautery with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let his hairs grow out, if he is one of those who removes them, until they are lengthened and even. 
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if they sting him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow out.  
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have therefore grown out and are even, then place the patient's head in your lap; then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with a cautery, a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.  
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a swab soaked in albumin, or in psyllium mucilage on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply the cautery with fire, which has this shape.  
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure which you have marked gradually in many applications until the surface of the skin which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, appears entirely and properly burned. 
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is this: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and the hairs rising at the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore raise your hand then, and let him go for three days.

Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment until he is healed. 
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of the hairs return after an hour and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that place as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If, however, the hairs are below: then cauterize it until it rises to its natural place and becomes equal so that the hairs do not sting the eye. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the manner of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case. 
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as if you should direct the sick person to let out the hairs until they are lengthened and equalized. 
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from paper or cloth a shape of a myrtle leaf. 
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from lime not soaked an ounce one or so from each; then grind them together with good friction and do it quickly so that it does not congeal.  
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then from the pan put it onto the paper which you made like the shape of a myrtle leaf and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes. 
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a swab soaked in albuminous material; and let the head of the sick person be in your lap.  
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on top of the medicine and press it for a short time. 
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you will move it whenever the sick person feels the bite of the medicine; because he finds its bite like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore he perseveres in this that he finds a bite, then let go the medicine and move it with your finger.  
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the bite rests, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water. 
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then if you see the eyelid rise as it rises with fire or with an incision, it is good; and if not, then repeat upon it from the medicine upon the place in which the medicine does not imprint and does not blacken until your operation is equal and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then put on it a swab with butter until the skin of the burn is eradicated. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with diaphinicon ointment or another until it heals.  
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you, during the operation, to keep the closest watch, so that nothing from the medicine may fall into the eye. 
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	And if the eyelid softens after a few days, and something from the hairs fights its way into the eye, then repeat the medicine upon that place which softens from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed. 
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of a myrtle leaf. 
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and equality.  
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore let your consideration be according to that, and let the way of righteousness not be hidden from him who has a desire for this art. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the manner of cauterizing in a tear fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter Nineteen.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, as we said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary for you to cauterize it according to this method. 
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the sick person to place his head in your lap and let a minister hold his head between his hands so that it may not be moved nor shaken with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place cotton infused in alum or in the mucilage of flaxseed over his eye; then with fire a cautery, whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a hawk's feather quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate up to the other extremity, and if you wish it to go upward then try this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However this concave shape is better for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and draw out the pus from it and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and draw out its pus.  
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place upon it the cautery which has been ignited very hot. 
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	Hold your hand for a short time with it near the cautery by the eye, towards the side of the nose, so that your hand does not stray, or the weak person become restless; and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and burn it. 
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	Therefore if you reach at the beginning of your cautery up to the mouth, it will be well. 
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if it is necessary with that: and leave it for three days. 
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a compress with butter, and care for it with a drying ointment until it is healed. 
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	And if forty days pass and it does not heal, then put upon it a sharp corrosive medicine until the mouth is exposed; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter. 
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another way of cautery for a fistula, which some of the first have said. 
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Attend to the place of the fistula and find it; then place in the fissure a thin cane, that is, a thin cannula, whose form is this.  
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of a drachma of melted lead, and hold your hand with the cane in a good grip, and let the weak person not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach their eye. 
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place upon the eye of the weak person a compress soaked in albumin, or in water.  
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it with a marvelous healing. 
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	And if the fistula is healed with what we have said from cautery and treatment, it is good. 
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal foramen and reduce the fistula back into the course of the nose, according to what will come in its proper place. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	Concerning the way of cauterizing fissures of the lips.

Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Very often fissures occur in the lip, which are called pili, and especially in the lips of children. 
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you treat these fissures as we said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not work, then a small knife-shaped branding iron should be applied with fire according to this form. 
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And its concavity should be according to the subtlety of the knife. 
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then quickly place the heated branding iron itself into the fissures themselves until the branding iron reaches the depth of the fissures.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with cerate until it heals. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the method of branding a fistula of the mouth.  
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI. 
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth; then it makes pus and bursts: afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs out, and a fistula forms: then you treat it, and treatment does not work, then it is necessary that you apply a branding iron with fire according to the size that fits in the fistula. 
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the heated branding iron into the fistula opening and hold your hand there until the heated iron reaches its depth and end; do this once or twice. 
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterward with what we said about treatment until it is cured.  
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the discharge is cut off and it heals, it will be good. 
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupt bone according to what will come in its chapter.

When the gum softens due to humidity and the teeth loosen, and you treat it with medicine but it does not work, then place the head of the weak person in your lap. 
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then a cautery iron, the shape of which will come after this, so that you place the cannula over the tooth; and insert into it the ignited cautery quickly: and hold your hand for a short time until the weak one feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth. 
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to your wish. 
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the weak one fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour; and spit it out. 
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth motion is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Concerning the way of cauterizing in toothache. 
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII. 
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold itself in it, or a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help; then the cautery is used on it according to two methods: either a cautery with butter, or a cautery with fire. 
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	But the cautery of it with butter is, that you take vaccinated butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a crucible. 
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a wick, and wrap it over the end of the tent.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then dip it into the boiling butter; and place it over the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools; then repeat it several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, dip wool, or a wick in cold butter, and place it over the aching tooth; and place ignited iron over it until the fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But cauterization with fire is, that you apply a tube of air, or a tube of iron. 
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let something of thickness be in its body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the weak one.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then a cautery by fire, whose shape will come; and place it upon that tooth; and hold your hand until the cautery becomes cold. 
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or another day.  
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary in the impression of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for an hour; then he spits it out. 
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery. 
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever extremity you wish according to what is possible; and this is the form of the cannula.

When fistulas are from phlegm, and from cold humidities, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them quickly; then a concave cautery by fire, whose form is this. 
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that the smoke may exit at the cautery from one extremity; and place it ignited upon the abscess once, and a second time, if necessary with it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess. 
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	Which if the abscess is small; then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.  
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it cotton infused in butter, until what the fire burned is removed.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then care for it with tooth salve until the shape of the cannula is healed.

When humidities overcome the channel of the lung and especially when it is with coldness of complexion then it is necessary that the weak one be evacuated first with solutions. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it at night at the root of the throat in a depressed place and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery nor the skin unless a little of it.  
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the juncture of the neck at the last vertebra of its end and let the cautery be gentle according to the way which preceded.

When Cough and illness of the Lung are from cold humidities and the weak one does not have a fever nor phthisis and the illness is old then cauterize it with two cauteries above the fork in depressed, gentle, empty places.  
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples and let the cautery be of a cannula according to the form which preceded.  
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if your cauterization wishes to be by pricking with a cautery which is called a Point, whose form preceded in the cauterization of ear pain and let there be points from thirty points up to almost others.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which preceded until it is healed. 
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And let the cautery have three branches according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore cauterization is relieved with it when you do it with it with one three cauteries. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cauterizing in dislocations of the shoulder. 
Caput XXVII.	Chapter Twenty-Seven. 
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to humidity and does not return to its place within an hour, until it becomes accustomed to this displacement, then it dislocates from a slight movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation. 
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the weak person is placed on their back or on their sound side. 
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin which is inside the shoulder joint upwards with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint dislocates inwards.

Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and a cauterization mark will appear with four points. 
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three points, so that the cauterization mark then has six points; and the points are chosen according to subtlety. 
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the shape of a cautery having three points. 
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one more is added in this way, so there are eight cauteries.

Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the weak person adhere to tranquility so that the limb is not moved for a while until it is strengthened. 
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clauile cautery or by pricking with many cauteries. 
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened and the humidity is removed; and the weak person is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	On the method of cauterizing the stomach.  
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter Twenty-Eight.

When cold and much humidity happen in the stomach, until they draw it from its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied to it, and assiduous modes of treatment are applied, and they do not help: then it is necessary that the sick person be put on his back, and extend his legs and arms. 
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the size of a spoon's handle on the breastbone, a cautery on the clavicle, and two cauteries below from both sides of the one cautery, until a triangular figure of the cauteries comes.  
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And space them apart so they do not join together when they make pus. 
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the quantity of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.  
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery by which this cautery is made be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form. 
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it for him who is terrified from this cautery: and it is that you sign upon the stomach a point according to the quantity which you wish with encausto; then cauterize it with a point cautery; then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing a cold epar.  
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX. 
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain happens in the epar from coldness and humidity, or from thick windiness, until superfluity departs from its natural complexion by egress, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and does not make progress in it: then it is necessary that the sick person be put on his neck, and three cauteries be signed with encausto according to this figure, and the same quantity above the epar below the hypochondria, where a man's elbow reaches: and let the space which is between every cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand much with the cautery. 
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity thereof which is cauterized be from the thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it not added; and let the weak man stand upon his own feet. 
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs, and raised his arms. 
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of a cautery. 
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize with this cautery using a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art. 
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself so that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and the thickness of all the skin is cauterized, wherefore the whole body is cauterized, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is subtle, know therefore that. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing liver abscesses. 
Caput XXX.	Chapter Thirty. 
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens that you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, it assails the sick person with pain and gravity without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with pain there is vehement sharpness: and you see now that it has fatigued the physicians who treated him. 
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it is necessary for the sick person to recline on his neck. 
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then figure the place of the abscess with a heated cautery; then ignite the cautery which resembles a ray. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that one cautery until all the skin is burned and it reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment of exit wounds until it is healed.  
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary for one to use this kind of cautery except for someone whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged; and through whose hands these kinds of illnesses run with frequent experiment; then let him dare to perform this type of operation.  
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	As for dismissing her, I prefer to do so myself. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the Method of Cauterizing in Pleuresy. 
Caput XXXI.	Chapter Thirty-One. 
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery with the roots of aristolochia should be applied to cold pleurisy in this way. 
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you should take a long dry root of aristolochia and choose the longest one, which is found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger. 
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in oil and ignite it in fire. 
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck, and with two small cauteries under the shoulder blades a little lower towards the part which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And also with two cauteries in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs a little lower towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. 
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, rather let it be manifest on the skin while smelling. 
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And now some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron similar to a rod; and they ignite it and insert it into that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess itself, and pus comes out; as we have said in the abscess of the liver. 
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear, that either the weak one dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no healing. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter Thirty-Two. 
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat a disease of the spleen, as we said in the treatment of divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not succeed, then there is cautery on it according to three ways, which are all right. 
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of them is to make three or four cauteries by cutting along the length of the spleen according to the shape of liver cauteries, whose figure precedes it. 
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be a quantity equal to the thickness of a finger, or more or less, between every cautery. 
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the mode of the cautery be equal as we said in liver cautery. 
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient be lying on his back.  
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another way of cauterization is: to have a cautery with two points, as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and lift the skin which is directly over the spleen where the left elbow of the patient reaches; and let your elevation be such that you lift the skin according to the width of the body so that the cauteries may fall according to the length of the body. 
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert the two burning points deeply until you penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; thus making four cauteries.  
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish, cauterize with another cautery having three points. 
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cautery after you have let it discharge pus for many days; for it is more effective than any other treatment which precedes it.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the method of cauterizing in dropsy. 
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter Thirty-Three. 
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	Cautery does not apply to dropsy unless it is specifically ascites. 
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat dropsy with the methods of treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another above the liver, and another on the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be near the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then let the open cautery be dismissed, so that it emits pus over a long time. 
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not discharge the weak one from treatment after the cautery with it, for two intentions must gather for him, and healing will hasten to him with God's help.  
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be clauilis, according to its aforementioned shape; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its aforementioned shape. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs. 
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.  
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses form in a dropsy and are filled with clear water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocrati region, which is between the auricular and annular regions; raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand and do not move it at all. 
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the clear water will be reddish, and the cautery should be of this shape. 
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the sharp end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other below it, about the middle of the leg; and two cauteries on the whole thigh; and let the open cautery be dismissed without treatment for a long time so that some water may exude from it; then treat it with the rest that we have mentioned. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterizing in abdominal rupture. 
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.  
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is an abdominal rupture from cold and humidity until the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines weaken, and it is treated with treatments but does not heal; and you see the weak patient tolerating a cautery of abundant power, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach according to what preceded regarding cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four slender cauteries in a circle around the navel with a slender clauilis cautery; and a cautery above the groin with a large one, or two cauteries.  
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see abundant moistures, and the patient weak enduring that, then cauterize it with a cautery over the comb, and with a cautery over all the groin; and perhaps you will add two small cauteries over the stomach near the large one. 
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a progressing cure whose benefit does not err. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the manner of cauterizing hemorrhoids. 
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six. 
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted humors, and they are cured with what we said in the division, and the cure does not help; then cauterize with three cauteries over the lower vertebra of the back under the scapula a little triangularly, and a cautery under the navel like two fingers. 
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face inflamed, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded; and with a cautery over his liver, and another over his spleen, with a clauili cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time; then care for him until he is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the manner of cauterizing atheromas after their excision. 
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter Thirty-Seven. 
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise atheromas, then heat a cautery that resembles a ray.  
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited one into the excised atheroma; and keep your hand until the cautery reaches the orifice of the vein from which blood flows; do that once or twice. 
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	Therefore, if there are many atheromas, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated. 
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what helps them from ointments until they are healed.  
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery iron above the ligature, it is best for healing. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus. 
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-Eight. 
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not obey the incision and work which we have described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery. 
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	Therefore when it happens to someone that a fistula becomes old, pus runs from it, and corrupt humors. 
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is therefore fitting to do what is necessary, so that you examine it with a delicate probe. 
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then ascertain the depth of it with a probe. 
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then ignite a cautery iron which is similar to a spoke.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the ignited iron into the fistula itself and mark the amount that it entered. 
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery upon it until all those corrupt substances are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the necessity of your judgment. 
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And be careful of burning a nerve if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or towards the intestines, then beware of all those places. 
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place and you consider that it is not penetrating.  
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it heals. 
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed and materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time, then know that it has now been healed completely. 
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or deep within it there is a corrupt opening, or something like that, of which the remembrance will come in its place.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing the kidneys. 
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter Thirty-Nine. 
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold, or from thick windiness, and it diminishes because of that weakness of his, then it is necessary to cauterize it over the almethenem over the kidneys themselves, with a cautery on all the kidney with a clauili cautery, of which remembrance preceded. 
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the very same almeidat. 
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines will come. 
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be better for relief. 
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter Forty. 
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and humidities, until the sick person does not retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the pubis over the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and with a cautery from the right side of the pubis, and another from the left side of it: and let the length of that cauterization be according to the size of a thumb-joint: and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or two cauteries if necessary for that: and let it be according to what preceded, a clauili cautery. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter Forty-One. 
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and humidities occur in the uterus, and it is forbidden by that from impregnation, and its menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a lower back cautery, or two cauteries: and let the cautery be clauile.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing the shoulder in dislocation. 
Caput XLII.	Chapter Forty-Two. 
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucosal humidities are poured into the socket of the shoulder, and they become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of it is that one leg is extended over the other, when they are compared to each other: and a vacant place is found in it. 
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary that you cauterize the weak cautery upon the pitch of Anchae itself with a circle similar to the cautery; after you have marked with encaustic a circle around the pitch, as it revolves: and so that the pitch itself may fall in the middle of the circle. 
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the form which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach. 
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	But if you do not have this cautery present, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the amount of the thickness of the skin throughout. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in sciatica. 
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII. 
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the pitch of Anchae, and its cause is cold and humidity; and the weak one is cured with that which we said in the division, and the cure does not avail, and it becomes old: then it is necessary to dissolve the weak one from thick humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and the like. 
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him. 
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautery in this is according to two methods: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire. 
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many methods. 
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you cauterize upon the pitch of Anchae itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form. 
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make their depth good, or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space which is between every cautery be of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be an olive one. 
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, cautery is done in the middle above the head of Anchae itself.  
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries. 
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose shape precedes in the cauterization of a wide dislocation, make it one: so that it is a circle containing the whole dislocation. 
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of all the skin. 
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain is adherent to the wide area itself, and does not extend up to the thigh and leg. 
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends up to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place to which the sick person points there, in which there is pain, and your cautery above the calf four fingers towards the wooded side a little: and let the cautery be a knife-like one. 
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin. 
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if the sick person points out that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there where he points with a point-like cautery, three, or four, or more, if it needs it.  
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he points out the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery. 
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And be careful in all your cauterizations, that you do not finish with the cautery so as to burn a nerve, or a large artery, and thereby bring upon the sick person an evil harm, or contraction. 
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have indeed already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the calf, and finished in the cautery, and the leg swelled up, until a tumor reached the foot, and it was perforated all through, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there occurred a rupture of the belly, and death after that. 
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	But if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize both according to this method.  
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men have said in the cauterization of a wide area, whose mode of cautery this is.  
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a knife of iron, its diameter being half a palm; and let there be at its opening according to the thickness of the knuckle, or a little less: and within that knife let there be a third knife. 
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between all the knives be by the amount of a knuckle; and let the knives be open on two sides; and let their height be about a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make for them a handle of iron conveniently fitted to the knives. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then heat it in fire until it glows and projects sparks; then place it on a pillow with the patient lying weakly on their healthy side. 
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.  
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then dismiss him for three days. 
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards plaster with butter; and dismiss the open wound for many days.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed. 
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Says Albucasis, we have rarely used this kind of cautery, my son, on account of the terror of its appearance; and therefore because we have found few who will endure it.  
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless it is among the good cauteries for him who endures it and finds its place with it. 
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But the cautery with healing medicines is for you to make two knives having a pierced handle into which descends the hinge pin of its gate from brass or iron, the length of a span; whose height shall be two knuckles, or as they are themselves.  
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space that is between each one be the thickness of a finger; and let them be open below and above; and let what contains them to each other be according to this form. 
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on a broad pillow, the patient lying on their healthy side.  
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand hard upon the broad pillow.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles hot water, which has been heated with fire for a short time, and hold it for the space of an hour: and let the sick person endure its bite and its burning, for he will find the bite like fire until the bite is quieted. 
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe away the hot water from the whole wound with fresh water; then leave it for three days. 
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter upon it until the blackness of the burning is removed; then leave it for several days and let pus run from it. 
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is the last resort in healing. 
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals. 
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	But if the pain extends as far as the hip or leg: make him a bath containing water according to what you did for the wound equally. 
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.  
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and quicklime each a part: grind each and put them in a new pot, whose lower part is pierced with one small hole according to the quantity which enters the radius itself; and place under the bottom of the pot another glazed pot; and pour over the alkali and lime fresh water, which submerges both by a finger; after which you press them with your hand with good pressure; and let the pot stand until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glazed pot. 
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then add all that water and pour it over other lime; and strain until it is renewed.  
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other members.  
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it effects the operation of fire itself. 
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among medicines are those with which wounds are cauterized, also like turpentine and cashew nut honey, and lime with soap, so that both are thoroughly mixed. 
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed related the cure of a certain man from ancient times, by which he was cured of pain in the ankle and sciatic vein; and he praised it greatly. 
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he needed no other treatment and that he was healed from one draught until he related that perhaps he had entered a bath carried in and came out of it already well. 
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from the leaves of a green fig; and if green is not found, let it be taken dry, fresh; and it is mixed much with a little fat and placed on the ankle where there is pain, or the leg, or on the hip; and it is tied on and left for three hours, or by the amount which the sick person feels the heat subside. 
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into a bath. 
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes hot, introduce him onto a couch. 
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain goes away, and he is healed. 
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary for anyone to use a cautery with these medicines unless after evacuation of the body. 
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who also said that when goat dung is cauterized with it, it applies it to the sciatic vein; and a cautery is made in this way. 
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool and soak it in old oil and place it on the deep spot which is between the thumb of the foot and the sole, and which is nearer to the sole. 
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung and inflame it in fire until it becomes charcoal.  
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. 
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.  
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not therefore cease to do this until the feeling reaches through the middle up to the ankle and the pain subsides. 
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinum cautery.  
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On the Cauterization of Back Pain. 
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter Forty-Four. 
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, from infusion of cold and humid matter; and cautery indeed does not apply except in this one kind, which is caused by infusion of cold matter. 
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore it is necessary after evacuation of the sick person with fetid pills, and similar things, so that they are made on the back, where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the knife itself; after signs are made with a hot iron in every line five cauteries, or more according to the amount which comes from the endurance of the sick person's strength; and let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery. 
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries, or four, with a middle-sized pointed cautery, according to this form. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the Method of Cauterizing in the Beginning of a Hunchback. 
Caput XLV.	Chapter Forty-Five. 
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	Very often this illness happens to small infants.  
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is: that a constriction occurs upon him in breathing near elevation, and motion; and in youths at the last vertebra of the back and its nodes, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae. 
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see that, and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a cautery which is a circle according to this form. 
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery cover the whole part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery two lines or three, and let the points be close to each other.  
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place until it heals with what we have said. 
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you administer cautery in a hunchback which is caused by spasm of a nerve.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing gout and joint pains. 
Caput XLVI.	Chapter Forty-Six. 
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are from cold humors, which are poured out into any part of the body, then when they happen in the feet, it is customary for physicians to name that Podagra properly. 
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Therefore, when Podagra of a cold cause is treated with treatment methods and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them. 
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is to cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the feet with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive wood. 
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose form is this.  
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if it is necessary to prick on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. 
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pains rise up to the knees or other joints and this often happens then cauterize him over the whole knee with three or four cauteries from every side with the same olive wood cautery.  
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need more with this cautery then cauterize him. 
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery but let it be approximately the thickness of the skin only.  
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if pains rise to the knees and back then administer what we said from the cautery in its own chapter. 
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	But if the pains are only in the hands then prick around the knuckles like two lines revolve.  
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if any pain remains in the fingers then prick them on every knuckle and on the palm of the hand. 
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if pains rise after days to the elbows or shoulders then cauterize both from every side.  
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not remove the weak person from a good regimen, from taking medicines.  
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is made and phlegm is evacuated he will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the manner of cauterizing ruptures. 
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines or omentum descends to the testicle and it is beginning nearby, then it is necessary that you advise the sick man to abstain from food on his day. 
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives so that the feces may descend from his abdomen.  
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back and instruct him to hold his breath until it emerges or the omentum or intestines appear. 
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers and mark with a cautery under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose end is like half of a circle toward the upper part of the body.  
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the hot cautery, which has this shape, until it becomes white and projects sparks. 
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestines or omentum to its cavity.  
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant place his hand on the spot so that the intestines do not come out and you have already opened between the sick man's thighs and placed a cushion underneath him, and one servant above his thighs and another above his chest who holds his hands. 
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on the mark itself with your hand holding the cautery standing straight. 
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you have reached a bone with it or repeat another application if you did not reach a bone with the first one.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestines during your cauterization so that you do not burn it and there comes harm upon the sick man or death or great injury. 
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach a bone with the cautery your operation is of no avail.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery be delicate like that for children according to their size. 
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with the remaining ointments until it heals. 
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the weak one lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed. 
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you provide him with nourishment for the length of his healing time, which soothes his belly so that the intestines do not protrude during straining and defecation. 
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to rise after forty days, then administer a bandage well made, and let him hold it for another forty days. 
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should abstain from labor, and the fullness of food and drink, and loud voices.  
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, thus he heals with complete healing. 
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the treatment of ruptures with incision in its own chapter. 
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	But when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly and are beginning and you wish that they not be added to, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let that which is burned be one-third of it from then on.  
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for him as we have said, and it will not be added to. 
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some first ones have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form.  
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is signed with an encaustic and a line is put which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.  
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery held tight. 
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the way of cauterizing for pains because of a fall or blow. 
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain limbs because of a fall or blow and that pain persists for a long time, and healing with medicine does not come upon it: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a point cautery.  
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be for every member according to its size, and its suitability, and its weakness, and its power, and the placement of the twist, and the pain from it. 
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	Then if it heals from the first cautery, it is well. 
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat the cautery upon it. 
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For it is customary for these pains to change from one member to that which is next to it.  
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary for you to pursue them with the cautery until the weak one is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Those with leprosy are sometimes greatly benefited by cautery. 
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy which occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you wish to cauterize it consider. 
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	Therefore if the leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with that which we said in the division, and it does not descend nor remain stationary, and you fear for the weak one that corruption may spread over their whole complexion: then cauterize them on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two temples, and one behind above the nape of the neck.  
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And with the last cautery press your hand upon it a little while until it makes a small impression on the bone, and the crusts are loosened from it: so that respiration of coarse vapors may be relieved from it, and also cauterize the spleen with a cautery according to what preceded. 
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy is already spread over the weak one and appears manifest then it is necessary for you to cauterize with these cauteries which we said upon the head, and a cautery upon the end of the nose, and two cauteries upon the two maxillae, and two cauteries upon the vertebrae of the neck, and six upon the vertebrae of the back, and one large one upon the alhaossos at the base of the tail and one above it, upon the very almeidati: and two upon the anchas: that is to say, upon every ancha with one, and two upon the knees: one upon every knee, and two upon the shoulders, and two upon the elbows, and two upon the soft parts of his chest: and cauterize him upon every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet: and cauterize every heel of his feet and the focilla of his hands. 
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are above the heel bone, so that you do not burn them. 
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery over the bone of the pectoral muscle, and with another over the bone of the stomach, and with another over the liver.  
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more beneficial it is and the more binding. 
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that a weak person does not find pain in the cautery, as healthy people do, because his body is already stunned.  
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of magnitude and size according to the limbs and joints, as previously described from the types of instruments. 
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cautery with flour of herbs mixed with honey, and other care, until it is healed.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the manner of cauterizing in a stupor. 
Caput L.	Chapter L. 
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a limb is in a stupor and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to the magnitude or smallness of the limb.  
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery penetrate into the thickness of the skin a little. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.  
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for a certain stupor which occurs in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves that move the limb, and the stupor is removed. 
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let no one presume to do this unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves that move the body. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the manner of cauterizing albare.  
Caput LI.	Chapter LI. 
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When an albare becomes old and nothing from medical arts is effective in it: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with herb flour, and lentils with rose oil, and arnoglossa leaves, and dove blood, and swallow blood: let there be one part of each; mix all these things together, and spread them on a cloth, and apply them to the place, until it is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the Method of Cauterizing Cancer. 
Caput LII.	Chapter Fifty-Two. 
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When a cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery all around it, as it revolves. 
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise have said that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the middle. 
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	However, it does not seem right to me; for I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen this happen many times. 
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the Method of Cauterizing Adenitis.  
Caput LIII.	Chapter Fifty-Three. 
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has adenitis and it is delayed in ripening, either because of excess causing it, or because of the infirmity of age, when they are old and have little blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the ripening of the adenitis, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing. 
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it alone. 
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with ripening. 
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then a hot iron cautery, which has this shape.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the adenitis until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be weak after that which follows so as to alleviate the course of pus. 
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the Method of Cauterizing an Ulcerating Condition.  
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIV. 
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosion is nothing but a corruption walking in a member and corroding it; just as fire eats dry wood. 
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corrosion in a place which can bear cautery with fire, then apply much cautery with fire, small and large clauiae, according to what suits the place where the corrosion is. 
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption and nothing of it remains at all.  
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let it alone for three days, and put powdered sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized places until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.  
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born in which there is no corruption, it is good. 
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery on that which remains from the corrupt places. 
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And a corrosion is sometimes treated with an acute medicine.  
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it arises in the place of a cautery. 
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is of quicker healing; and I have already said its cauterization with an acute medicine in a division: therefore take that there when it is necessary. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the Method of Cauterizing Warts and Corns.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Very often this ailment occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a thick, filtered thing which injures the foot. 
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed cautery in them is according to two methods: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water. 
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	But as for that with fire, it should be a concave cautery similar to a vulture's claw, made of iron according to the size which contains the wart from every side; and let its margins be subtle. 
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then lay it ignited upon the ulcer. 
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn your hand with the cautery around the ulcer until the cautery reaches the depth of the ulcer; and leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus. 
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster it with mullein leaves, crushed with salt; and leave the plaster upon it at night. 
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots. 
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed. 
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they are not inverted and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet; then apply to them a cautery with hot water: and it is such that you should take a cannula from bronze, or iron, or from a vulture's quill; and lay it upon the ulcer, or althelul.  
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour into the cannula a small amount of hot water; hold your hand and turn it with the pressure of your hand for a short time so that the edge of the cannula is impressed upon the root of the ulcer, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the ulcer: and let the patient wait a little above the bite of the hot water for an hour. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it alone, for the ulcer will be eradicated with its roots.  
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this to them one by one until you come upon all of them that are in the body. 
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated with that which generates flesh from ointments.  
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Tremor
Caput LVI.	Chapter Fifty-Six. 
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone that Tremor arises from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or another cause; then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five upon the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra a cautery, and one upon his chest, and one upon his stomach. 
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor indeed ceases with an olive-wood cautery, and healing hastens for illnesses of cold nature. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the Method of Cauterizing by Albatir. 
Caput LVII.	Chapter Fifty-Seven.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul things, that is, pustules, are expelled from the body by Albatir, which are caused by corrupted thick humors. 
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize them over the whole head of the pustule with a delicate cautery made of myrtle wood, whose end is ignited with fire. 
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with a long aristolochia root. 
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.  
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the very beginning of their expulsion in this way; and they do not grow larger; and the excess is broken up, making them, and they are healed from them. 
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it must be done after evacuation with bloodletting. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the Method of Cauterizing in a Flow of Blood from an Artery in a Wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter Fifty-Eight. 
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Very often it happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut at a wound, which happens externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or a cautery of a limb, and similar things to these; and it becomes difficult to stop it. 
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the orifice of the artery, and place your index finger upon it; and press it very much until the blood is constricted beneath your finger, and nothing goes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small olive-wood cauteries into the fire, and a great many of them; and blow upon them until they become thoroughly ignited.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place in which the artery has been ruptured; and place the cautery upon it, after which you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off. 
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled when you raise your finger from the opening of the artery and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery, from those prepared in the fire. 
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease to do that with one after another until the blood is severed. 
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerve which is there, and lest other harm befall the weak patient.  
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to sever it: especially when the artery is large, except with one of four ways. 
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said. 
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.  
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities are contracted and the blood is severed. 
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature thread.  
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicines of a property which severs blood are placed upon it and it is constricted with a decent poultice constriction. 
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But he who performs its severance with a ligature and constriction with cloth or positioning of burning things and similar things does not quite bring it to a close except rarely. 
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if it should happen to someone and there is neither a physician present nor medicine: then let him begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and a very strong constriction thereof until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.  
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, but always with cold water of vehement coldness placed upon it until the blood freezes and thickens, and is severed. 
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile he should consider what he needs from a cautery or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds and Similar Things. 
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the First Chapter that every disease in which it is fitting to use fire with a cautery and burning medicine, its occasions, causes and instruments, and forms of cauteries. 
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed chapters there from the head down to the foot. 
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter the same way so that it may be relieved for the seeker who seeks his question. 
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter is from the fear that which is in the first chapter on cauterization. 
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for that reason it is necessary that there be more caution in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, very often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of an exit, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and those similar to them: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death falls upon many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that which is hesitation falls upon you, for sometimes there fall upon you in this art ways of men with ways of illnesses. 
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is he who becomes angry with his illness, and death is light to him because of the vehemence of his which he finds from his sickness and length of its malice. 
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness is from fear which signifies death.  
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from them is he who gives his flute player and enriches you with him, hoping for healing, and his illness is harmful. 
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not necessary that you consent to him who comes to you from them, whose way is such. 
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vehement than your greed and avarice. 
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from him unless after certain knowledge which verifies with you that to which praiseworthy succession arrives. 
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the treatment of all your patients, prognosis and indication as to what is conveniently for their health. 
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that there is help to you on the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise. 
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you His intellect, and not take away from you direction and inspiration: for that is in his hand. 
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I myself ordained this chapter distinguishing by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter of Cautery, from the neck down to the feet: so that it may be eased for you what you desire from it, and what you need. 
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the treatment of Water which gathers in the heads of children.  
Caput I.	Chapter I. 
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this infirmity often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without ease. 
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I myself have not seen this illness in others than in children: and to all of them whom I saw from them, death hastened: therefore for that reason it seemed to me to let go of the operation on it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I myself saw from them a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger each day, until it could not sit upon itself because of the size of its head: and the moisture increased until he died. 
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this indeed moisture, either gathers between the skin and bone: or it gathers under the bone above the suture.  
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that case, if the moisture is between the skin and bone, and it is a small abscess, then it is necessary for you to make an incision in the middle of the head one finger wide: and let the length of the incision be as much as two knuckles, until the moisture runs out. 
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a spatula. 
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then make those two fissures, according to this form. 
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side; and the water is depressed when you press it with your hand to its interior, and it is not concealed from you: then it is necessary for you to cut in the middle of the head with three fissures, according to this manner. 
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision extract all the moisture. 
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the fissures with cloths and lint. 
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then embrocate it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day. 
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with tents and ointments.  
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not let go binding the head with equality. 
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak person with all dry food of little humidity, until the limb is strengthened and healed.  
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another manner of incision is to consider where the magnitude of the abscess appears, and the collection of water. 
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the vertex, or on the right, or on the left.  
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore ascend with the incision where you see the abscess and the filling of water; and split it according to what is possible for you. 
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe lest you fall upon an artery and there should occur a flow of blood, and the weak person should die from that flow with the evacuation of the moisture.  
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the Incision of Arteries Which are Behind the Ears. 
Caput II.	Chapter II. 
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When it happens to someone that there are catarrs to the eyes, or to the chest, and it grows old, and healing is not brought by medicines; then the last cure in that case is the incision of those two arteries. 
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore it is necessary when you wish to cut them, for the weak person to shave his head. 
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries may appear. 
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the weak man tie his neck with any of his cloths. 
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where a vein pulses. 
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are the depressed places behind the ears: and they are rarely concealed, except in some men. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a cautery above each vein; and cut through each with a sharp bistoury on both sides, the incision reaching to the mouth; and let this be done across the breadth of the head. 
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the bistoury under the artery and cut it upwards with an incision.  
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	Let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together. 
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood flows out in a throbbing stream, which leaps to the insides with frequent jumps.  
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a cautery and cut down to the mouth. 
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what is necessary to let out from the blood is six ounces; and perhaps you may let out more or less from it.  
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of this according to the quantity which appears to you from the weakness of the man and the fullness of his artery. 
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains at the mouth of the wound from the cutting, cut that off so that a hot abscess may not occur; then bind the wound with bandages from linen cloth. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.  
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples. 
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man suffers from an old headache or sharp catarrh due to acrid humors and heat in the temples' muscles, or an old, vehement soda and similar ailments: and he is treated with methods of medical care and it does not work; then we have found experience in these illnesses of extracting arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them as we have described.  
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	The manner of operating in the extraction of these is that the sick person should shave the hairs which are on the temples and stretch towards an apparent artery in the temple. 
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it indeed shows itself to you from its pulse and is rarely concealed except in a few men or by the violence of cold. 
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	But if it is concealed from you, then let the sick person bind their head with any cloth of theirs; then rub the place with a rough cloth.  
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or steam the place with hot water until it appears to you manifestly. 
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the speculum, which I fashioned a little before.  
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then with it scrape away the skin easily until you reach the artery. 
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then thrust a hook into it and draw it upwards until you draw it out of the skin and make it come out from all the tunics that are under it. 
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	But if the artery is slender: then enfold it with the extremity of the hook. 
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a part according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and contracted so that bleeding does not occur. 
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut and not severed, the blood does not ascend thoroughly. 
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from the blood six ounces up to three.  
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if the artery is large: then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread or with threads of aloe, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the consolidation of the wound and bleeding occurs. 
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess which is between the two ligatures.  
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this in that hour or another hour afterward. 
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife cautery: until its ends are incised and it stands in place of the same operation. 
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better work unless he who is weak has a fever or an overheated complexion. 
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For cautery is one of those things which help to finish humidities. 
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy. 
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries that the place be filled with old cooked lint and poultices made loosely be placed upon it. 
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the loosening it should be treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to grow and with ointments until it is healed. 
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if while you are operating it should happen that there is a flow of blood from the artery then hurry to cut it off with a cautery or to fill the place with wax and press your hand upon it until the bleeding stops. 
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	But if none of those things are present to you then put your finger upon the place until the blood congeals.  
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embrocate the place with water of strong cold until the sharpness is calmed and it is bound as needed. 
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is lighter and easier for the extraction of a vein it is to cauterize a vein with this cautery having two knives and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to a razor.  
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However they are of much less sharpness than two knives. 
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp like two knives the cold rushes to both and they do not strike the flesh with speed.  
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	But since there is a little thickness in them the heat of the fire is retained in them and the flesh is cut quickly and by this means the work is better than all other works and lighter and easier.  
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space which is between the two knives be the thickness of a finger after you mark two places with plaster and put both ignited strongly until they reach the mouth and strike the vein in two places so that what is between its ends is lengthened. 
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not thoroughly consolidated with this cautery. 
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery. 
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Concerning the treatment of sharp, persistent courses of tears from the eyes.  
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV. 
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are persistent, and their course is from the veins which are above the outer part of the head; and no cure with medicine is effective against them; and you see the face of the sick person already reddening, and he feels a movement in his forehead like the movement of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that his eyelashes are already corroded with erosion; and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients used this operation for their cure, and they called it the Cure with the Sword. 
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is that you order the sick person to shave the hairs which are on his forehead.  
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions in the forehead, equally spaced, according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second a little after the length according to the movement of the temple muscles, and the third from the other side; and be careful not to cut the arteries which are on both sides; and extend your hand away from the continuation of the two mandibles, and let the distance of the whole incision be the size of three joined fingers; and have a piece of sponge prepared for you, or many dry cloths, with which you dry the blood.  
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a speculum with two pointed ends, whose following form is soon: 
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the side of the temple, up to the second incision; and scrape out with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, with a knife, which is above the mouth.  
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision. 
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this speculum, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp curette, blunt on one side and not sharp on the other. 
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form. 
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the attached flesh with the skin, and its blunt side towards the opening; and press it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut off with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes; except that the incision should continue up to what appears from the skin. 
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then make that in the middle fissure up to another fissure. 
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal quantity runs out from the blood, press out the places from clotted blood fragments. 
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure a pledget of old baked cotton, and put on them poultices soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar. 
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that hot abscess does not occur.  
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the ligature, and administer a large infusion with warm water. 
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with oil of roses, and the rest by which wounds are healed: until it is healed.  
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of sharp tears and cataracts in the eyes from within the head. 
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When sharp, severe, persistent cataracts happen to someone; and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already debilitated; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, painful pain deep in the head, and consequent sneezing: then take from these occurrences, that those matters, and cataracts do not come, except from many veins. 
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better cure for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you order the sick person to shave his forehead. 
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one incision in the middle of his forehead, or another a little further over by its width; and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be up to the bone; and extend your hand away from the muscles of the temples, which move at mastication: until when the bone is revealed; and you will dry all the blood with a sponge. 
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with an old knife blade or with linen threads. 
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind over it with lint; and moisten the lint with wine and oil so that a hot abscess may not occur. 
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it and see that the hot abscess has already subsided; then it is necessary that you cauterize the mouth until flesh begins to grow there. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh; such as if you take two parts from wheat flour and four parts from colophony; and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the birth of flesh in these wounds. 
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the treatment of that which falls into the Ear. 
Caput VI.	Chapter Six. 
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a flowing thing, such as water and vinegar, and things like them; or some animal. 
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	Therefore, when a stone or a kind of stone falls into the ear from those which are not added to and do not grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun; if you then see the stone, then distill something into the ear from oil of violets or oil of sesame. 
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then perform its extraction and make it sneeze with a powder, and plug the nostrils upon the approach of sneezing, after you place around the ear wads from cloth or wool, and extend the ear upward. 
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Very often it comes out with this treatment.  
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not come out, then perform its extraction with a Gestis, that is, fine Pizigaroli; whose shape is this. 
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out with the Gestis, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then perform its extraction with a thin blind hook of few windings. 
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out through that, then make a tube out of metal and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening far in, and seal what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil so that there is no way for air except through the tube: then draw it out with your own strong suction. 
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Very often indeed it comes out with what we have described. 
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not come out this way: then take a small amount from hellebore, or from birdlime, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught; and put it on the end of the probe after you have wrapped upon it a bandage decently placed: then insert it into the ear opening with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.  
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have described, then hurry to cutting, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.  
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the manner of incision is, that the phlebotomist should first make a small cut on the head: and draw out blood from him according to his strength. 
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near his fat in a hollow place: and let the incision be moon-shaped until you reach the stone; then remove it with what is possible for you from the instruments. 
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the incision immediately with speed and take care of it until it heals.  
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	But if the thing falling into the ear is from one of the grains which grow and swell: then apply its extraction. 
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not yield to your exit, then take a thin, subtle spatula according to this form.  
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And apply it with an incision of that type from the grains which fall into the ear and do not do this when you think that grain has already been moistened by vapor from the ear until you put many splinters on it: then draw them out with hooks or with a subtle instrument, or with suction as we said for its extraction is alleviated.  
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	For the water which enters the ear, it is necessary that a weak person should use sneezing when it is first placed: and now he has filled his ear with some old cotton; and he is lying upon that ear, in which there is water. 
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	Therefore if it goes out through that, it is good. 
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire for a little while, and let the weak person insert one of them into the hole of his ear: and he should jump on one of his feet from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear. 
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore let him not cease to do this with stone and stone until all the water comes out. 
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out so that you can take one from a tinderbox or from a reed and insert one end of it into his ear; and ignite the other end with fire until most of it is burned. 
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat with another reed and do this many times until all the water comes out; and extract it with a tube as was previously stated for a stone.  
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	But in the extraction of an animal entering into it, if it is small-bodied, like a flea, and the like, take care of it as I said in the division. 
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is large-bodied and appears to the senses; then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks; and its matter is easier for all that are held in the ear.  
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you care for it with that which we said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not succeed; then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun.  
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	Therefore if something from the worms appears there, then extract it with gestures or with fine hooks. 
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there, then take a cannula, which has this shape, narrow below, wide above; and introduce the slender extremity into the ear according to the amount that the weak person can tolerate: then suck with it strongly. 
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do that many times until all the worms come out. 
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to come out, then wrap the cannula's circumference with wax, as I said regarding the stone. 
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	But if they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already experienced in the destruction of worms, and you will find it in the treatise on distillations. 
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your infusion with which you pour oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, of which the form is depicted here. 
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it yourself from silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there should be a small hole, wide above. 
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore let what is in the cavity of the cannula, be made of bronze appropriately. 
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a ray and wrap its extremity with cotton in a decent winding: then pour oil or juice or what you wish from these medicines into the cannula, and let the cannula be in the ear; then introduce the ray with the cotton on top and press it with your hand in a moderate compression until the oil is driven into the cavity of the hearing and the weak person feels it inside: and what is poured into the ear should already be warmed a little with fire: and beware that nothing which is distilled into it is very cold: for medicines do not tolerate it. 
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Concerning the care of accidental hair removal from the Ear. 
Caput VII.	Chapter VII. 
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also sometimes happens that hair removal occurs in the ear canal from a wound or flesh born there. 
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this incision is sometimes made deep within the hole of the ear, which does not follow sight; and sometimes it occurs near the outer hole a little, and it follows sight. 
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which occurs deep within the ear, and which sight does not grasp, is difficult to heal in many conditions. 
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which sight follows, it is necessary that you place the sick person's ear in the sun, and look at it: then if you see an apparent incision, open it with a subtle speculum, whose form is as follows, let its extremity be in which there is a small width, of which a part is sharp; and let the remaining speculum be of two smooth sides: so that it does not injure the ear.  
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	But if the incision is flesh-born in the ear canal: then hold it with a subtle hook, and cut into it with vehement ease, until all the flesh is removed.  
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	But if the incision is deep within the ear: then take a subtle, gentle ray, and warm it slightly with fire; then send it into the ear canal. 
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the incision with it, which the sick person finds with difficulty of hearing, try to open it with ease; and be careful not to wound the nerves of the ear. 
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place a licorice stick in the ear according to the quantity of the amplitude of the hole, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days, until you are sure of the consolidation of the wound. 
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take licorice, and infuse it in rose water, and sprinkle ground zig over it, and use that. 
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	But if you see the ear already inflamed: then it is necessary that you remove the licorice, and allow it with another licorice, which you wrap in cerate made with rose oil, until the hot inflammation subsides; then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If blood flow should occur, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water and place them on the ear; and use the remaining treatment which separates the blood flow as described in the treatise on distillations. 
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the Treatment of Cataracts. 
Caput VIII.	Chapter Eight. 
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These cataracts which occur in the eyelids are sometimes humid and sometimes dry. 
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary to hold them with tweezers or with a hook and to cut into them at their roots with a scalpel. 
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place pounded zedoary on the spots.  
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood should flow from them, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery. 
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For very often they return when something remains from their roots. 
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and they do not return.  
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the Treatment of Granules of the Eyelids. 
Caput IX.	Chapter Nine.  
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Very often something occurs in the eyelids which resembles a grain in its firmness and hardness, and on account of this it is called a Granule; it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid. 
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore the operation on them is to consider then if it is a Granule proceeding from within, which appears from the eyelid and moves in all directions and its matter is easy. 
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Then make an incision over it across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it away from all sides with ease until it comes out. 
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if the incision does not prepare for you its separation unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then it harms the weak person somewhat. 
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the fissure is large: then bring it together with suture; and treat it until it heals. 
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it. 
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and makes it flesh. 
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the hailstone is sloping towards the inner parts of the ear towards the inner surface, then invert the eyelid and suspend the hailstone with a hook: besides which you will need an incision, and press it from every side. 
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, it does not harm anything. 
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then bathe the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water and treat the place with that which makes flesh until it heals. 
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Concerning the care of the eyelids. 
Caput X.	Chapter Ten. 
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat which generates in the coats of the upper eyelid and it most often happens to children. It weighs down their eyes and they get catarrhs in the mornings and cannot look at the light of the sun because tears rush to them, and therefore you see them lying on their faces always and sleeping on them and their eyelids are wet under their eyebrows, which has already been covered by inflation and the eminence of Axirnath is visible to the eye and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them. 
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the manner of its operation is that he who has it should put his head in your lap.  
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare lye in it and make from that lye a circle according to the amount which contains the Axirnath on every side.  
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put it on top of it and press with your fingers from every side so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle. 
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a scalpel making incisions across its breadth and let there not be an incision larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.  
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Either you must cut through the whole skin until you reach the Axirnath, for in many dispositions it arises from a fissure according to the shape of a white fat wedge. 
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it with the cloth which you inserted between your fingers to the outside, and you will turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and beware lest you add anything in the fissure so that you do not reach the eye with the spatula and injure it. 
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you will add a little into the fissure with ease until the Axirnath proceeds. 
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we said. 
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak cloths in vinegar and water and place them over the area and compress it with bandages.  
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people who rub salt and place it in the cavity of the fissure so that it liquefies what remains from that moisture.  
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed. 
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if a hot abscess should happen in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed. 
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the ways of treating Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid softens and it becomes wrinkled as it should not. 
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.  
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs in addition to the course of natural hairs are born on the eyelids and become inflamed, then they harm the eye and cause illnesses such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and white spots until it becomes a cause for destruction of the eye.  
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, Ataxmir of the eye is treated according to four methods. 
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Either by cautery with fire.  
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cautery.  
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture. 
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through reeds, as I shall say. 
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the sick person in your lap. 
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand. 
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If then it is turned back, it is good. 
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not, introduce a needle into that part of it where the thread is located from the lower part of the eyelid and make the needle with the thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid in which they are born; and draw the thread upwards together with the eyelid and turn it back with a rod. 
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid below the added hairs with a speculum inserted from the greater lacrimal duct to the lesser lacrimal duct. 
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread and place under the eyelid a small ball of cotton or cloth; then mark on the eyelid with an unguent, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However it is necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid; because it now varies among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For some of them need a large amount to be cut from the eyelid according to the amount which is softened by the eyelid. 
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with a speculum find above the two lines which you have marked and begin from the greater lacrimal duct to the lesser lacrimal duct, and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a rod. 
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then flay the entire thing itself.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then join the two lips together with a needle and fine woolen thread; and cleanse the blood, and make what overflows from the threads adhere to the two eyebrows, with certain invisible things if you wish to do it; and if not, do not care. 
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let the suture and threads remain for three or four days; afterwards care for it. 
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, let the wound be without suture and care for it with that which dries and constricts. 
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its gathering; but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of healing ancient teachers have taught. 
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Truly there is anxiety about the sick person and it is from good practice and there is no fear in it. 
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, to make a sign on the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated. 
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then raise the eyelid with three hooks separate or joined, according to this following form; then cut off what is superfluous with small forceps, according to this form, with equality of incision. 
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook and it does not equal it; then take a needle in which there is thread and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and join the threads between your fingers with equality.  
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin above which is the marked spot as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two lips of the wound with suture and care for it until it heals. 
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if an abscess should occur at your incision or fissure: soothe the abscess with cerate and things like it from soothing ointments. 
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also that their hairs are turned.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you ought to use what we have said in the incision; but the suture for both is more skillful. 
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the care of Ataxmir with dogs
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you turn back the eyelid and split the fissure which is inside, according to what I have said. 
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then artfully make two reeds, or two slender sticks, the length of which shall be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of a spatula; and you have already incised at the extremities of each on both sides where you hold the threads. 
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then carefully place both upon that which overflows from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten the two reeds on both sides with a strong constriction, and leave it for several days. 
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the tightened skin will die, darken, and rot until it falls off by itself.  
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If however it is delayed, then cut it with forceps. 
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.  
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it firms up, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not sting. 
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two reeds, which you will make according to this figure and quantity in length and width. 
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On raising stinging hairs in the eye with a needle.  
Caput XII.	Chapter XII. 
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation on this is, that you take a fine needle and insert into it a fine, soft silken thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather its ends and tie both firmly with a delicate knot; and let the length of the threads be one palm. 
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place another fine thread briefly underneath it in the Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient place his head in your lap and be near the sun so that the operation may be illuminated; for it is a delicate or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you draw out the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up above the ligature; and insert into the ligature that hair: if there is one, or two, or three, no more. 
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out with the ligature into the eyelid with a natural hair. 
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the ligature is drawn and the hair does not come out with it: you draw the ligature down, with the thread which you have put into it, until the ligature comes out of the upper hole, and you see it with your eye; then indeed you draw the ligature and the thread; and extract both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it. 
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and elevate it with it; or leave it alone until it lengthens after a time, and then raise it. 
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the treatment of an alxatrati which occurs on the upper eyelid. 
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII. 
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called leporine. 
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this alxatrati is either natural or accidental.  
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental therefore arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things to those. 
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation on it is that you open that consolidation, and separate its lips, and place in it a ligature from linen, and tie it until it heals. 
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary for you to use things in its treatment which dry and constrict: for if you do that, the alxatrati returns worse than it was; rather use on it things which soften, such as fenugreek; and embrocate with water in which marsh mallow has been cooked, flax seed: and an unguent called dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some oil; and wrap it with a ligature, and care for it.  
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your healing is to try with all your ingenuity that it does not solidify according to the form which it had at first. 
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have said is nothing but a certain rectification of the Alxatrati so that the form of the place does not return according to what it was at all. 
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid and is a wrinkle or contraction upwards to the right and left. 
Caput XIIII.	Chapter Fourteen. 
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below is that which is truly called Alxatrati.  
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural and accidental. 
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental kind arises from a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and things similar to these. 
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of operating on it is to take a needle with a double thread and stain it with flesh color and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh. 
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upward with the needle and cut it with a broad spatula.  
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good. 
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if it does not [return as it should], take a ray and place it in the fissure and turn it with the eyelid; and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is made from them: so that when they are joined, their shape becomes this shape, which is the letter lambda in Greek.  
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by an amount equal to its lower sharp side from that which follows the eyelid. 
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separate parts, or sew them with wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said about softening medicines and those that are clean until they are healed.  
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a luxation should occur from a fissure, and suture or cautery: then it is necessary that you split the fissure flat beneath the eyelashes, even according to what preceded. 
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with lint, according to what we said. 
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the discourse on the care of luxation, when it is above or below, is that the operation should run in it, according to what is prepared from the form of the luxation. 
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it itself is of many varieties in form; and a prudent craftsman prepares his ingenuity with whatever way is possible for him, until he may return the figure to its natural form, or near it, and he himself infirm, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements. 
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter Fifteen. 
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural operations.  
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary that you insert the extremity of a radius under the eyelid and elevate it upwards; or extend it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be with the sharpness of an incision of spatulas, but rather be somewhat blunt: so that the infirm person is not disturbed at the operation, and the spatula is removed and injures the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you were scraping away that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns according to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.  
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, with blue water itself; or distill into it from a sieve made, from ziniar dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and eye with lint of flax; and place wool imbued with egg white on the eye; and after the third day use a sieve, and with dressings, until it is healed. 
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the cutting of the nail and the prominence of the flesh of tears. 
Caput XVI.	Chapter Sixteen. 
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is according to two manners. 
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is nervous, and it is similar to a hard, thin thread.  
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to white frozen moisture; which when it touches iron, or you try to take it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not stick in it. 
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both species do not begin except from the larger lacrimal duct, until it proceeds gradually, until it covers the sight, and prevents light and the movement of the eye. 
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation in its cutting is: that the sick person should place his head in your lap. 
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift his eyelid with your hand.  
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with a hook of few twirls, and extend it upwards. 
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, ox, or cow; and let the thread be strong, and double the extremity of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail; and pierce it with the needle, and bind the nail with thread, and extend it upwards; and flay the side of the nail which follows the pupil with the hair as if you were to press it with the hair up to its last part.  
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the lacrimal with a fine scalpel, or with small forceps; and let the natural lacrimal flesh be released so that a constant flow of tears does not occur from its incision.  
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone; or with thread as we have said. 
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then flay it with a gentle scalpel, which has this form.  
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware that the scalpel does not touch the corneal tunic, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is perforated.  
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw into the eye something ground salt, or made from alum, and let it remain until the next day. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with what is necessary until it heals. 
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	But if the nail is not nervous and you cannot insert a point into it nor does a hook catch in it, then this type of nail is often cured with medicines and heals as I have described in the division.  
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	But if you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the infirm person and take a delicate spatula, soft, weak in sharpness, according to this form. 
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the nail from above with subtlety.  
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	But if you see that it thins and breaks, and the scraper presses into it, then distill from your hour into the eye alum made water, or red alum water, or ground salt: and bind the eye until the next day.  
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation over it until all of it is removed. 
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in your eye: then let it alone and care for the abscess until it heals. 
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with a scraper until it heals. 
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	But if the prominence of the tear duct causes great harm to the eye, suspend it with a hook and cut out a portion of it; and do not finish the incision so that the course of tears does not happen. 
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then still red alum water or water made from alum into the tear duct until it heals.  
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Of the incision of a foreign body and flesh born in the eye. 
Caput XVII.	Chapter Seventeen. 
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes red flesh grows in the eyes of men, composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil or approaches and presses upon the eyelids and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it is likened to a rose baluster. 
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also that the sick person puts his head on your lap. 
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with one forceps, or hand. 
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel. 
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful from the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision be as you cut it, either with a scalpel, which we have described in the incision of the nail; or with small forceps, with which the asebel is collected, according to its shape after this chapter.  
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is complete, and all the chalazion is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it red powder, and the like corrosive medicines from it: and place cotton wool with egg white on the eye outside; so that it is protected from a hot abscess.  
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	But if anything remains from the chalazion, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then let go of the eye, and treat it with that which calms the abscess. 
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.  
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do likewise with the added flesh that occurs in the eye from this kind. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that others treat the cure of all weak eyes from natural or accidental ways by operating with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that the member can tolerate the operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the Gathering of an Asebel from the Eye. 
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII. 
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Asebels are red veins that are woven over the eye, and prevent vision from its operation: and they weaken the eye with the length of days.  
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye in which there is an asebel is strong and there is no sickness in it except for the asebel: then gather its asebel.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And direct the sick person to put their head in your lap. 
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those good ones with one hook, or two according to your discretion; and let the hook be a fine one of double thickness, according to this form, or let there be two hooks joined together in one body, according to this form. 
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then gather them carefully with fine forceps and wipe away the blood hour by hour until you see those veins receding from the eye and resolving; and be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the speculum. 
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	Let your operation be in the middle of the day in front of the sun and be very firm in your operation so that you do not strike anything except those veins. 
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then distill green vitriol or red into the eye so that its sharpness may corrode what remains from the sebum.  
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if it is not possible for you to gather it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with something that soothes the eye's pain and leave it for several days until its pain subsides; and guard against a warm abscess; then repeat the process on it in the same way until it heals. 
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.  
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of a nasal polyp.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call a nasal polyp Fistula, which you should treat with a cautery or with an acute burning medicine according to its preceding description. 
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal then there is no skill in it except to cut above the abscess at its origin and extract all the moisture and pus from it until the opening is exposed. 
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	Therefore when the opening is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then excise it with an instrument of this form. 
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called Asperi Capitis.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron indo, and let its head be round like an azir, which should be punctuated with a file punctuation, or a subtle aliskilfer punctuation; and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone. 
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand upon it a little while, until you know that the corruption is already smooth; and do this several times. 
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying astringent medicines. 
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	And if the place is consolidated and flesh arises therein, and the course of blood is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, nor does it fester, nor does any accident happen to it: then you will know that it is already healed. 
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, there is no skill therein except to reduce the fistula to the nostril foramen, according to this manner. 
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you expose the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone has been exposed, then take an auger according to this manner, let its iron end be triangular; and let its wood be a pyramid tapered down to the extremity, as you see.  
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it upon the bone itself; and let it be near the lacrimal; and extend your hand a little from the eye.  
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then revolve your hand with the auger until it penetrates the bone and feels weak; by this it finds wind escaping from it when holding his hand over his nose.  
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you. 
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When flesh therefore arises, and the place hardens: then the material which was pouring out to the exterior returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter upon the weak one. 
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the Reduction of an Eye Eminence.  
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When an eye protrudes with its totality and neither harm nor diminution occurs to the vision; then it is necessary that you loosen the weak one; then phlebotomize him; afterwards apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification but with suction. 
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place upon the eye a liniment which is made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocol. 
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above with a plaster and many poultices.  
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the manner of the poultices is: that you should take many soft cloths and double each cloth from them four times; make many from them; then place them one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye needs; then bind over them with a hard cloth a strong binding.  
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat cuppings with suction without scarification. 
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cuppings and let the eye remain bound day and night.  
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bandage again becomes loosened, then it is necessary that it should be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we have said. 
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	Therefore if you see the eye has already returned to its former tunic, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, poultices, binding, and cuppings until it heals. 
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Concerning the incision of the tunics. 
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI. 
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the tunic of the eye, and then it protrudes and proceeds beyond the eyelids like a grain of the eye, and disfigures the form of man because of it, and you wish to excise it; then the operation on this is as I shall relate: it is to insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower to the upper part.  
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle into which is a double thread from the lacrimal part and make it penetrate; and let the first needle go according to its own disposition.  
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread and tie it with the part of the eye around the needle; and bind it tightly. 
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the needle and place upon the eye wool soaked in egg white; and let it remain until the thread falls with the eye. 
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with that which strengthens it until the wound is healed. 
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes it is bound by a circle of cloth from all sides, until the eye adds great prominence.  
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce it with a fine speculum, which reaches the depth of the eye, and let the white humidity flow, and let the eye descend, and enter immediately; then bind it until it is healed. 
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of Alconati. 
Caput XXII.	Chapter Twenty-Two. 
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment which is called Alconati is nothing but blood which gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself. 
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation on it is that you make the weak person sit upon a prepared seat, or upright.  
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head with your hands on both sides and move it until you see the blood arrive at the lower parts of your eyes.  
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then fix it so that it does not descend and illuminate the light; and let the weak person see things as he used to see; and if it does not descend below, you know that it is water. 
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent of the blood is not prepared with what we said, then make the weak person sit between your hands. 
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine speculum and pierce with it above the corneal membrane a little at the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the crown until the blood comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when it comes out, then distill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then care for it with the remaining treatment until it is healed. 
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water, which descends in the eye, or cataract. 
Caput XXIII.	Chapter Twenty-Three. 
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already said the kinds of water in division, and which is suitable for piercing by speech declaring and explaining, then take that same one according to health. 
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the weak person sit square between your hands, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his sound eye, and constrict it strongly; then draw down the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one. 
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take the lancet in your right hand, if the eye is the left one; or in your left hand, if the eye is the right one. 
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the point of the lancet near the cornea for the width of a radius in the very whiteness of the eye, appearing near the lesser lacrimal; then thrust the lancet with force; and you will revolve your hand with it until it penetrates into the albuginea of the eye; and feel that the lancet has now reached the empty thing. 
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the lancet's journey to its depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of blackness; and this is the cornea of the eye. 
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see these things in the very pupil by the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the lancet up to the place where the water is. 
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it down below with force, one after another. 
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the weak person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the lancet in his eye. 
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little while.  
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then deposit it a second time, beyond which the lancet goes out. 
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed and does not ascend; then extract the lancet easily; and you will revolve your hand gradually. 
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something of clear rock salt in water; and wash the eye within it. 
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place a whole cotton pad, or wool soaked in rose oil and albumen, outside the eye; and bind it with the sound eye. 
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, and those of our time, place ground cumin with egg white over it. 
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	But if the almond does not yield to entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then you must take a speculum called an Alberid, which has this form. 
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore pierce only the conjunctiva with it and do not insert your hand into the opening: and it is only so that you may make a way to the almond's place, which is narrow. 
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almond as we said.  
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And when your work is complete, prepare a well-made bedchamber for the weak one in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house; and prohibit him from all movements and coughing; and give him food which soothes his nature; and let him not move his head to the right nor to the left at all. 
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	Let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day.  
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark house and make him try his sight; and have him look at things. 
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.  
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary that he do this during the hour of healing or immediately after the incision; rather, let others do it because water rises quickly through a violent gaze.  
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a hot swelling occurs then you must loosen the eye before the seventh day and correct it with that which soothes the swelling until it is soothed; then release his sight and place an oral remedy on his face by which his vision is regulated for several days, he himself being in that dark house. 
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him gradually leave the house and engage in his usual activities.  
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that a disciple is not excused from vision several times in surgery; then let him dare to perform the operation. 
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed, there has come to us a certain one from those who are of Al-Ayraq, who said that it was done in Al-Ayraq a perforated well, by which water is drawn up. 
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that, nor have I read it in any of the ancient books, and it is possible that it is new. 
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from a well, so that it stands upon it who does not know them. 
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of bronze properly: and let their ends be with the same delicate triangularity, and pointed end.  
Formae magda.	Forms of a well. 
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the treatment of flesh born in the nose. 
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV. 
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes there are born in the nose various added fleshes, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion of many feet: and from it is cancerous flesh, stony, of a dark color: and from it is that which is soft flesh, not of a dark color.  
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, in that which is soft flesh from these fleshes, not deceitful nor cancerous, it is necessary for you to make the infirm person sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open their nostrils, and project a hook into those fleshes: then draw them outward, and cut what you have grasped from them with a thin sharp scalpel on one side, until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.  
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	And if something remained from it of which incision is not possible: then scrape that with one of the subtle instruments easily, until nothing remains from it.  
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it by what is necessary: or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hurry to cauterize it until the blood is severed and all the flesh is removed. 
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then vinegar, and water, or wine should be projected into the nose after the incision.  
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it as far as the palate, then you know that it is already healthy. 
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that there is flesh grown inside it upon the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision. 
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you introduce a linen thread which has some thickness, and knots in it many knots; and place between each knot the quantity of a finger, or less: and contrive, so that it sends one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it like a razor; and draw out his odor, until it reaches as far as the palate, and emerges over his throat. 
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed very often they do something like this to children in schools; and it is an easy thing for him who wants to do it. 
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, the one end which emerges over the nose and the other which remains inside the nose. 
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then apply a flesh clamp with the knots that are on the thread.  
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already held with the knots of the thread. 
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then draw out the thread and after removing the blood put a linen cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment into the nose; do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh. 
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Finally, at the end of the procedure, put a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals. 
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it needs drying treatment, use that. 
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a nasal douche, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it from silver or bronze; which is like a small lamp, open like a shell; and its passageway similarly. 
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the bowl of the instrument for making a head bandage should be full and open, with a handle at its end by which you hold it when heating oil or whatever juice or fluid substances you wish in it. 
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument. 
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of a broken nose. 
Caput XXV.	Chapter Twenty-Five.  
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Very often a break occurs at the end of the nose, and it swells and increases with each day until its appearance is ugly. 
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this reason it is necessary that you cut into it at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it.  
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place upon the spot either a cautery or a burning medication which will stay in its place. 
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	But if the incision is delayed until it swells, then consider if it is stony, hard, of a dark color, and has little sensation: then do not touch it with iron because it is a cancerous ulcer. 
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen those who cut into such an ulcer and great harm befalls him who has it. 
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the ulcer is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout its entirety, then empty the weak spot and cut into it without fear or hesitation: and treat the area with something which dries and constricts it until it heals. 
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.  
Caput XXVI.	Chapter Twenty-Six. 
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a break occurs in the continuity of one of these cartilages, surgery makes little difference in it unless in certain people.  
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore when this happens to someone, consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood: and then join the two lips of the wound with sutures; then treat it until it heals. 
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the break are already separated and each part has become healthy, then you must scrape away all the skin from its apparent surface until it bleeds. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join two lips with suture, and tighten them, and sprinkle dragon's blood and ground frankincense upon it; and place a piece of diaphycon plaster, and one from another of the consolidating plasters, above the powders; and let it be tied for two days, or three. 
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then untie it, and change the medicine; and let it be so until the threads are cut off by themselves.  
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed. 
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suture, however, is to join the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the abdomen; or join the solution with thread, as I made you know.  
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the Extraction of Nodes of the Lips. 
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII. 
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many men indeed have hard boils, similar to grains of herbs, occurring mostly in the inner parts of their lips; and some of these are smaller, and others larger. 
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you turn the lip, and cut over all of its node, and suspend it with a hook, and incise it from every side. 
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with powdered zedoary, until the blood is cut off.  
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then wash it with vinegar and care for the place with it, in which there is astringency, until the wounds are healed. 
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the Incision of Flesh Born Upon the Gum.  
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Very often flesh grows upon the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.  
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary that you suspend it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and incise it at its root, and let the serum run, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place powdered zedoary upon the place, or other astringent, drying powders.  
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after healing, for it often does, then cut into it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after cautery. 
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the reason of teeth with iron. 
Caput XXIX.	Chapter Twenty-Nine. 
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, ugly crusts gather on the surfaces of teeth from both the inner and outer sides, and sometimes they become darkened, turning yellow or green, until corruption from that reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through it. 
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore it is necessary that you make the weak person sit between your hands and their head in your lap, and grind a millstone and tooth, where crusts appear to you like sand, until nothing remains of them, and similarly do so with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and others, until they are cleansed. 
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	Therefore if what is from the beginning of the reason for them is taken away, it is good; and if not, then repeat the reason over them on another day, the second and third, until at last you achieve what you desire. 
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth needs razors of various shapes and many figures according to how it is prepared for your operation; therefore the razor with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the razor with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes. 
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of razors should be prepared by you, as you see.  
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the Extraction of Toothache. 
Caput XXX.	Chapter Thirty. 
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You must care for the tooth from its pain with all your ingenuity and delay in its eradication. 
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is no substitute for it when it is eradicated, as it is a noble substance: until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then when the weak person is forced to eradicate it, you must strengthen and assure yourself of the aching tooth.  
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Very often pain deceives the sick person, and they think it is in a sound tooth and extract it; then the pain does not cease until the diseased tooth is extracted. 
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists. 
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Therefore when a painful tooth is confirmed with you, it is necessary that you make incisions around the tooth with a scalpel, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides; then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps at first gradually, until you shake it. 
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and the head of the diseased person between your knees: which you have now held well so that it does not move; then pull the tooth according to its straightness so as not to break it. 
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first. 
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you must fill that hole with cloth and tie it with the end of a fine ray, so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction upon it with forceps. 
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you must act delicately with the incision all around the gum on every side a great deal.  
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person from that greater evil which is his first pain.  
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness over its eradication, besides administering that which we have narrated. 
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they very often cause great infirmities to happen upon men, which are more difficult to break and which leave all or some of its roots remaining; or that they extract it with certain bones of the jawbone: as we have testified many times.  
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then let it be washed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt. 
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	And if it should happen that there is a flow of blood from the places (for it often happens), then apply something from wool tow and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if you do not have wool tow. 
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the forceps with which a tooth is moved should first be long-shafted, with a short handle, thick so that they do not double when pressed upon the tooth: let them be as you see with thick handles, so that when you squeeze them, they do not give way or double: with short shafts, and made of good iron or steel, well fashioned, straight-shafted: and on their ends are teeth, some which enter others and constrict with a decent force. 
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the ends are made like the shape of the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, and they are of strong constriction. 
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth, and the extraction of broken jawbones. 
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains at the removal of a tooth which is broken, then it is necessary that you put upon the place cotton with butter for one or two days until the place softens: then insert into it an algast, or forceps: whose ends are assimilated to the mouth of a bird called a stork. 
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This is the shape of these forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their ends be made like a file within, or like a pair of pincers.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not yield to you towards its removal with these forceps, then it is necessary that you should carve upon the root, and detach all the flesh, and insert an instrument which is called a small Lever, whose shape is this. 
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be short-shafted, slightly thick: and let it not be imbrued so that it does not break. 
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	Therefore, if the root comes out through that, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to pull with these other instruments whose forms are these. 
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first one is triangular at the end, in which there is a certain thickness. 
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the triangular end is slender. 
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also pulled with this instrument having two branches, which has this form.  
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that preceded in the manner of teeth. 
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Pulling may also be done with this instrument which resembles a large hook, of this shape, with a twisted triangular end, in which there is some thickness so that it does not break; and let it not be soaked. 
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many tooth instruments; and likewise the other instruments are not counted, and a skillful artisan, subtle in his art, finds an instrument for himself according to what the operation and illnesses themselves indicate to him. 
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For there are illnesses for which the ancients did not mention an instrument because of the diversity of their kinds.  
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the jawbone breaks from the mandible or from other bones of the mouth, or it putrifies: then carefully examine it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and forceps that I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and pull with a pair of tongs, which has this form. 
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be a certain gradual thickness in it so that the bone is drawn tight or held with it, and does not flee and wander, until the bone comes out; and restore the place with suitable medicines for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction and care for it until it heals. 
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Concerning the Lock of Teeth Projecting Above Others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter Thirty-Two. 
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth project not according to their natural course, it becomes ugly through that; and especially when it happens in women and girls, namely those of marriageable age. 
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to consider. 
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not placed, or its serration is possible, nor its filing: then eradicate it; and if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, which has this shape. 
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp end. 
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such that you cut it into many days, and on account of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another is not disturbed from the teeth. 
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is prominent and exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of tempered iron, which has this shape.  
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle of very small points, like a file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed, and falls out; then soften it, and in the end eradicate it with certain razors.  
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	But if there is a tooth from which a part breaks off and injures the tongue, then it is necessary for you to file it even until the roughness of that fracture is removed and it becomes equal; and it is made flat so that it does not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.  
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Concerning the Retention of Teeth with Gold Threads. 
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter Thirty-Three.  
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer a concussion and shock from a blow or fall, and the infirm person cannot bite down on it so that it does not fall out; and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the cure has not worked; then there is an idea in this, for them to be tied with a gold thread; because silver turns green and rots after days: but gold never changes. 
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be medium in subtlety and thickness according to the amount that it takes between the teeth.  
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And indeed the manner of retention is to take a thread and insert twice its length between two sound teeth; then you weave with the two ends of the thread among the loose teeth, whether there be one or several, until you reach with the ligature up to a sound tooth on the other side. 
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving back to the part from which you began; and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it is not at all moved; and let your constriction where you bind the thread be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose. 
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with forceps; and join both, and turn them over with a gesture; and hide them between a sound tooth and a loose tooth so that it does not injure the tongue; then let it remain thus tightened until it heals. 
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if they become loosened or broken, bind them with another thread and it will hold thus for the entire time.  
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of Teeth, and the figure of retention of two sound teeth and two loose teeth as you see. 
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after a fall or blow, and are retained as we have described and remain; and this is not done except by a craftsman who is prudent and experienced. 
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece of bone is adapted; and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in its place, from which the tooth is fortified and tightened, as we said; and it remains and is used with it for a long time. 
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the incision of a ligament which occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.  
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV. 
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed. 
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is to open the mouth of the infirm person in your lap and raise their tongue; then cut that nervous ligament across its width until the tongue is freed from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted in it, and if that is from the consolidation of the wound, then thrust a hook into it and probe it across its width until you come upon a ligament and loosen the knot. 
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful that there is no fissure deep in the flesh so that you might cut into an artery and bleeding occur. 
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wash the area of the incision with rose water or vinegar or cold water. 
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen wick under the tongue, which the patient should hold in his mouth all night so that it does not heal again.  
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if bleeding occurs, then put powdered eggshells over the area. 
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the bleeding overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a lentil-shaped cautery which is suitable for that; and then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. 
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the Removal of a Ranula Which Occurs Under the Tongue. 
Caput XXXV.	Chapter Thirty-Five. 
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth. 
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation on it is to open the patient's mouth before the sun and examine the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	And if you see it is of a dark or black color, hard, to which the patient does not feel sensation, then do not touch it because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	But if it is inclined toward whiteness and contains moisture, then thrust a hook into it and cut it with a fine scalpel and free it from every side.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	But if bleeding overcomes you during your operation, then put powdered eggshells on it until the bleeding stops; and then return to your operation until you extract it with all of its contents.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be washed with vinegar and salt; and let it be cared for with other suitable treatment until it is healed. 
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the Treatment of an Abscess in Two Tonsils.  
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter Thirty-Six. 
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes swellings occur between the throat and the palate, that is, glands which resemble almonds, and these are called two tonsils; when you treat them with what we said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.  
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	Therefore if it is a firm abscess, dark in color, with little feeling; then do not touch it with iron. 
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red in color and its root is thick; then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but rather let it alone until it matures. 
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either pierce it or it will burst on its own. 
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is slender; then it is necessary to cut it open.  
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is such that you should consider before your operation whether its hot abscess has quieted completely with rest or diminishes somewhat; then have the weak person sit facing the sun, and let their head be in your lap; open their mouth, and let a servant hold it between their hands and press their tongue down with an instrument which has this form. 
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	It should be made of silver or bronze, thin like a knife. 
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	Therefore when you press it down with that, and the abscess is shown to you and your sight falls upon it; then take a hook and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outward as much as you can, except that you pull some of the coats out with it. 
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it open with an instrument which has this following form.  
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It resembles forceps; nevertheless its tips should be curved so that the opening of each of them is directly in line with the other sharply; therefore take care that it is made of tempered steel or filled with alum.  
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a scalpel, which has this shape. 
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other. 
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut one amygdala, cut the other according to this same kind of incision. 
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water. 
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if a flow of blood should occur, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled; or myrtle leaves, and things similar to these astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped; then care for it until it heals. 
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two amygdalae.  
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore cut them according to what I said in the cutting of the two amygdalae equally. 
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was drawing it to choking, with few senses, because it had almost closed the throat; and the woman was breathing for me through a narrow passage, and had already prohibited her from eating and drinking water; and she had already come to death if she had remained for one day or two days. 
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches until they came out above the two nostrils.  
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Therefore I hurried quickly and fastened a hook into one of them. 
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.  
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it where I grasped it from the nostril. 
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did that to her which proceeded from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; and afterwards I fastened a hook into the abscess itself; then I cut off a portion of it, and there did not flow from it except a little blood; therefore her throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water, and then she received food. 
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times over a long period, and an abscess would succeed in the place where I cut it until it was prolonged too much and with it that. 
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat. 
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It therefore ceased from adding; then I walked away, and I did not know what God did with it after me. 
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Concerning the cutting of an abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter Thirty-Seven.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a catarrh descends to the uvula and becomes abscessed and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called uvula.  
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said in division, and the treatment does not avail; and you see that the hot abscess has ceased from it, and it is subtle; then it is necessary for you to cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And whatever from it is a rounded mass, and there is no length to it, and it is bloody, or tawny colored, or black, and there is no sensation to it; then it is necessary for you to avoid cutting into it. 
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in this there is fear over the weak one. 
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is therefore necessary when you see it according to the manner which I said from its whiteness and its length, that you make the weak one sit before the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument of which we spoke previously; then fix a hook in the uvula and draw it downwards; and cut into it with one of the two instruments which I said in the cutting of the two tonsils. 
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you not cut from it except that which is added above the natural limit without addition.  
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you injure the voice and speech. 
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the cutting use what we narrated in the cutting of the two tonsils; and care for it until it heals. 
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the patient is terrified of the incision: then it is necessary for you to use skill in cauterizing him without fear or trembling. 
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the manner of cautery in this is not done except with sharp water; and it is, that you place the head of the patient in your lap. 
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned. 
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you in the chapter on cautery and mix it with an unquenched lime, and put it neither thick nor thin; and fill the hollow of this instrument, which has this shape. 
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremity in which the medicine is placed be a concavity, like the concavity of a snail's shell.  
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine upon his tongue; and let the patient lie on his side so that saliva runs from his mouth through the inward medicine, so that nothing descends from it into his throat and harms him. 
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.  
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first place it upon his tongue for half an hour's time until you see it already blackened and the bite of the medicine quieted.  
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take cotton and wrap it over the extremity of the rod, and infuse the cotton with medicine and insert the rod with the cotton into the cannula from above until the cotton adheres upon the tongue.  
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times until you achieve what you desire concerning the cautery of the vein. 
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then dismiss it; for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.  
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	And if it is inconvenient for you to repeat the medicine, repeat it; and after cautery wash around the vein with cotton soaked in butter, and cleanse what is around it from the medicine; and gargle with cold water.  
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated externally with embrocations and internally with gargles until it is healed. 
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this kind of treatment is healthier by cutting and farther from fear. 
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes a wound is healed even with something more subtle than cautery and incision; for it is healed with fumigation, in this way. 
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamint, hyssop, origanum, rue, sage, chamomile, wormwood, and similar herbs; and put them all together, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and let them boil; and the pot should be well plastered with clay; and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which an instrument shaped like a bowl is placed.  
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	It should be made of silver or bronze; and the end in which there is a pomegranate seed should be inserted into the sick person's mouth until the vapor rises to the wound above the tube until the wound is darkened greatly. 
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat it over the wound many times until it dries up. 
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful not to do this treatment at the beginning of an abscess's arrival.  
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it often adds to the abscess; and it is not necessary that you do this unless at the decline of its heat. 
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a reed and place bark on its end so that the sick person's mouth is not burned; for the bark of the reed prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is a good healing with safety. 
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat. 
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII. 
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone or a fishbone, or something else, sticks in the throat.  
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore it is necessary that you extract what appears of them upon which sight falls, after you push the tongue with an instrument toward the sun, and it is shown to you what is in the throat. 
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you cause the sick person's stomach to be empty before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps indeed it may exit by vomiting. 
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the weak one may swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or swallow a morsel of dry bread; or take a piece of soft dried sea sponge: and tie it on a thread, then swallow it. 
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	Therefore when it reaches the place where the spines or bone are, and is drawn out, then it comes out.  
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we said: then use an instrument made of lead according to this form. 
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be a little thicker than the radius, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which it may introduce into its throat with ease: and let it have its head raised upwards. 
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest he should have a cough, and push with it the mouth, or spine; or the physician may introduce it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the weak one introduces is better, because of his knowledge of the place where the thing is attached: and he pushes it down, or draws his hand up with the instrument, all of it according to the amount that is prepared for him, until it comes out. 
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Concerning the Extraction of a Leech. 
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.  
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is medicated with what I said in the division on treatment with medicines, and it does not detach, then consider in the throat of the weak one in front of the sun, or by the sun after you have pressed its tongue with the instrument that I narrated to you. 
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with delicate forceps carefully. 
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	But if it is not possible with them: then take a concave tube and introduce it into the throat of the weak one up to near the throat; then introduce into the concavity of the tube iron heated with fire. 
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times; and let the weak abstain from all water for the whole day. 
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a bowl full of cold water, and open his mouth into it; and moisten his mouth with it, and swallow nothing from it; and stir the water every hour with his hand. 
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water. 
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not come out with what we have said, then fumigate the weak person with bedbugs, or with incense with the instrument which I have described in the fumigation of the uvula.  
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for it will fall off itself. 
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the manner of operation in fumigation is this: that you take a pot in which there are live plums with fire; and let the pot be covered with a lid, in the middle of which there is an opening; and place in that opening the extremity of the instrument. 
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then project the fumigation, and let the weak person place his mouth at the extremity of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not go out until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech immediately falls. 
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times. 
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the weak person endure thirst, and eat salt, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is therefore necessary that it comes out with this regimen. 
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls upon the sight.  
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat. 
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And the extremity of it is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is a roughness like a file; when it grasps something, it does not let go of it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of Abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general. 
Caput XL.	Chapter Forty. 
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to the recollection of them, namely one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation, and incision itself from two ways. 
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the kind of abscess in itself, and by that which it contains from humors. 
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second way is on account of the places, in which it happens in the body.  
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess happening in the head, is different from an abscess happening in the anus: and an abscess happening in a fleshy place, is different from an abscess happening in joints: and each of these has its own judgment from operation.  
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from abscesses there are which ought not to be perforated, except after the maturation of blood in them, and its completion: and from these there are, which ought to be perforated while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion. 
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses which are near joints.  
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an abscess happens near a joint, and is prolonged to be its own, until it putrefies what is around it perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore there is a cause for the closer contraction of that limb.  
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or there is an abscess at a principal limb: for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that or through it the principal limb.   
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it immature: and it is not necessary that you perforate a raw abscess, not of complete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefies deeply, and lengthens to the interiors of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or becomes at its end what does not heal. 
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the hour of perforation of an abscess, which has matured according to completion: and it is at sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and throbbing, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and the remaining signs.  
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of the more prominent eminence; and let the perforation be facing in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflex.  
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those that are reflected, go with the perforation according to that limb. 
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when an abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better that you leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the complement. 
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much filth and foulness, and perhaps its lips will become hardened, and its depth. 
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body when necessary, or according to that which the limb requires.  
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses, or many incisions according to the likeness of the magnitude of the abscess. 
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be concave: and it should be incised when it has already been made like cloth, and made at the end, which is already dead: as it happens in many, such as boils, and buboes. 
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And of these are those which are cut with a section having three angles.  
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from these is one from which it is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf. 
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an abscess of the groin.  
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among these are those in which a round section and a lunar section are administered, and similar ones to these sections. 
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	But that which does not have a head, such as soft and superficial abscesses, it is necessary to perforate it with a superficial perforation, or only flat. 
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, that you pierce it, so that you do not hasten and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract a part of it from it. 
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then bind up the abscess until another day. 
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again. 
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the progression, until it all comes out; especially if the patient is a weak person, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man: for the animal spirit is often resolved with the departure of blood from the animal; and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not perceive it.  
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore take heed of this chapter with great caution. 
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your piercing, by which you pierce these abscesses, it is necessary that you wash the wound; and consider. 
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or there is a flat incision, then apply a linen bandage, or an old tunic. 
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures of the perforation, it is necessary then that you insert linen into every fissure until they reach each other. 
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the abscess, or have hollowed it out around it; then it is necessary that you fill it with an old tunic, or as when cloth is woven, or shorn of linen fluff without moisture; and bind it up until the third day.  
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and care for it with what is necessary from ointment, until it heals. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water, and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them; and place it upon the place of bleeding many times. 
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer regimen, and treatment, and powders which I have described in many places of this our book, and by division. 
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is in the winter time, and the place of the abscess is full of many nerves; then it is necessary that you pour warm broth with wine and oil on it, and place them over the area. 
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer time, and the places are fleshy; then it is necessary that you place broth soaked in water and oil, or wine and oil, and all of that cold. 
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when it will be the third day, as we said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess and clean it, and minister to its cure what suits it, until it heals.  
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the cure of abscesses universally. 
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, I have now spoken of every abscess, how its way to cure is taken chapter by chapter individually.  
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the incision of abscesses which occur in the skin of the head. 
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of a kind of nodules, which contain sheaths, which are sacs to them: as if they themselves were like milked hens. 
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are many. 
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Of these, some are fatty; and of these, some contain moisture like slime; and of these, some contain moisture like whey and gruel; and those similar to them; and of these, some are hard and stony. 
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the incision of all, and their extraction there is no fear, as long as an artery does not oppose at the time of their incision.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in the incision of them is that you try it with an instrument, whose shape will come after this, which is called an Intromissor, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then dry it with an incision according to length with a superficial incision; according to this form. 
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with a section from line b to line g. When therefore the humidity is evacuated, then remove the skin kistin which contains it, and do not leave anything at all within it. 
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For very often it returns if anything remains in it. 
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the dressing in Egyptian ointment if it is present, and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and leave it until the next day. 
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remained from the cyst. 
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat upon it a dressing with Egyptian ointment a second time and a third, and if necessary again, until you are confident that nothing remains from the cyst; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals. 
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	But if the abscess contains a fatty node, then dry it according to this form, with a section having the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two lips of the section, and remove the skin from every side; and exert your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it. 
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if an artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.  
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do the same in a stony abscess, from the incision and treatment, as we have said. 
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision upon a stony abscess is easier; because there is little blood and humidity. 
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses which are on the head in some people, in which there is absolutely no humidity. 
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	For this is the reason: because I cut upon an abscess on the head of a young woman, and found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if one should strike it with something projecting, it would wound it.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other abscesses which occur on the head, besides these abscesses which occur on the heads of children and at the roots of ears, the incision of all of them should be superficial. 
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation in them always from their lower part, so that the course of blood is relieved towards the lower parts. 
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for it with what suits them from treatment. 
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the Section of Scrofulous Swelling in the Neck. 
Caput XLII.	Chapter Forty-Two.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Very often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body. 
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And concerning those which occur in the neck from them, there are some single, and many: and they are generated from one another: and every scrofula from them is within its own tunic, just as it is in nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have related. 
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these scrofulae.  
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And of them indeed, some are stony: and of them some contain humors; and of them some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.  
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore in that one which you see of good disposition to the touch, of which it is evident that it is close in color to the skin, and moves in every direction, and is not joined with the nerves of the neck, nor with a sinew, nor with an artery, nor is deep: it is necessary that you cut it with a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b. to line g. and flay it from all sides: and extend two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks if it is needed as we said in abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually. 
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And there is caution to be exercised so that a vein or nerve is not cut into.  
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel not be very sharp: so that it does not add to your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary. 
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or artery, or something prevents you from the operation, then put on the wound litharge pounded, or some powders which staunch bleeding, and compress the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to putrefy. 
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is cut off by a tourniquet; therefore return to your operation until you finish it. 
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger if anything remains from the ligatures or other small ones; therefore cut them and clean them. 
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is a large vein at the root of the ligature, then it is necessary that you not cut that ligature from its root; rather it is necessary that you tie it with a strong doubled thread and let it go until it falls off by itself without harm. 
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment. 
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for it yourself.  
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole ligature is cut, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound; and sew it immediately after you see that there is no remaining superfluity at all. 
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is remaining superfluity because of the size of the ligature, then it is necessary that you direct yourself to cutting the root of it and extracting it; and administer the suture as we said.  
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And that which from the ligatures contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial perforation so that the place of its maturity appears to you; and put the perforation away from what follows below the body as we said. 
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation lint with ointment and the like so that it corrodes what remains from the decay until when you see the wound already cleansed; then care for it with generative ointment of flesh until it is healed.  
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the Section of the Epiglottis from an Abscess Accidentally in the Throat. 
Caput XLIII.	Chapter Forty-Third.  
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said this section was in the epiglottis and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in those who have synanche, it is necessary that the section of the epiglottis be performed because it does not bring benefit through it; therefore, because all veins and lungs are weak. 
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no pain in the canal, it is necessary to use the incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the danger that arises from premature cutting. 
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do this, we must cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across its width, in the space between the two circles, so that the incision is in the mucous membrane, not in the cartilage; and this place is indeed suitable for incision because it is covered with flesh, and blood vessels are distant from it. 
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	But if the surgeon is fearful, then he must stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.  
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then let him fix the skin until he reaches the canal: divert the blood vessels if he sees anything coming from them. 
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then let him cut the mucous membrane as we have described; and it is recognized by the discharge of pus from it, with that which bursts forth, and the interruption of speech.  
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for a time. 
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore, the hour arrives in which premature cutting is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin and sew it alone without cartilage.  
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it heals. 
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis. 
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this discourse which we have described is not to be attempted except when they see that one of these abscesses has already choked the throat of the sick person; and he is raised up toward death, and wishes to interrupt his breath: they go to cutting the epiglottis so that the sick person may breathe through the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death; and for this reason they prescribed leaving the wound open until the malice of the sickness is consumed, and its malice lasts three days, or thereabouts; then they prescribed sewing up the wound and taking care of it until it heals. 
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I myself have seen is that one maidservant took a knife and sent it into her throat and it fell with it upon part of the pulmonary canal. 
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to her care and found her moaning like the moan of the dead. 
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Therefore I examined the wound and found little blood that had come forth from the wound. 
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore I was puzzled for she had not severed a vein nor a sinew and air was escaping from the wound. 
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I hastened therefore and sutured her wound and cared for it until it was healed and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice and she returned after days to a better state of health. 
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore from this I say that there is no fear in the incision of the epiglottis. 
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the section of a hernia of the throat.  
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter Forty-Four. 
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This swelling called a hernia of the throat is a large swelling according to the color of the body and it is found much more often in women. 
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it occurs in two ways either it is natural or it is accidental.  
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one there is certainly no skill required. 
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one however is according to two ways of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to a swelling that occurs from the knotting of an artery. 
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear and one ought not presume to approach it with an iron except when it is small and you should test it and investigate it carefully with a probe. 
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node and it is not suspended with any veins then cut it out as nodes are cut out and extract it along with what it contains from the cyst if it is in a cyst and if not then scrutinize its entirety. 
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with what is necessary for healing until it is healed. 
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the Section of Kinds of Knots.  
Caput XLV.	Chapter Forty-Five. 
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already said all their kinds in the division, and it is necessary that I tell here the difference between a knot and an excrescence, since it is a doubt-causing matter. 
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Therefore I say that when there is an excrescence, there is heat and fever and violent pains until the boiling of excess is settled and putrefaction is completed, then indeed the fever and heat subside.  
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But with a knot there is no heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains them in sacs called sifachin which are their own pouches, and they are according to the color of the body; and the beginning of them is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a bean, larger and smaller. 
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fatty or containing humidity. 
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division.  
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore it is necessary, when you come to the healing of a knot, that you experiment on it and inquire into it first with an instrument called an intromissor, according to which its shape will come in the chapter which is after this.  
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiry for all abscesses and knots is to take this instrument and insert it into the wetter place which you find in the abscess; and you revolve your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin. 
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then finally place your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess. 
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the intromissor and consider that which comes out in its trail.  
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	Therefore if humidity flows out, whatever its color may be, then dry it with a superficial incision, according to what I said in the other abscesses. 
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if the humidity does not exit in the track of the Intromissi, then you will know that it is fat; therefore cut upon it with a section having the form of a cross, according to this form as I have taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from every part easily; and keep the kistin upon it if you are able, so that you may draw out the whole thing healthy with the knot. 
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the kistin is broken at the operation, and it is not possible to draw it out whole, for this often happens, then draw it out in pieces until nothing remains of it. 
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or much remains of it, the Knot returns most often.  
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And if it overcomes you, and a little remains of it: then fill the wound at its completion with certain corrosive and sharp powders; and bind the wound, and place upon it something that sits hot and poulticed, and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. 
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	But if it is a large Knot, then suture its two lips together, and care for it as it grows into flesh.  
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if a vein that is pulsating or not pulsating is contrary to you: then hurry and fill the place with triturated terebinth, and leave it tight for two days or three until the wound putrefies and the ebullition of blood subsides; then return to cutting that which remained from the Knot. 
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning external instruments for incision and perforation. 
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI. 
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Of these are the forms of Intromissi, and they are of three kinds.  
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For of them there is a large one, and of them there is a medium one, and of them there is a small one. 
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of tempered iron with square ends, so that they may hurry the entry into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Experimentis; that is to say, perforating ones; and one of them is called a "beris," that is, "perforator"; and they are of three kinds. 
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For from them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one. 
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	It is agreed that they should be investigated through them abscesses, and fistulas, and buboes from that which is between them of bones. 
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, polished, like large needles with which stitches are taken, of yellow brass, or of bronze, or iron, or silver.  
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones are those that are made of yellow brass. 
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experience is also made of black lead, which are suitable so that fistulas may be tested through them, whose concavity has reflections, so that they are reflected with their smoothness with those reflections.  
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds. 
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from them there are long ones, from them medium ones, and from them short ones, according to the quantity of the amplitude of the fistula and its constriction.  
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The Form of Hooks, and they are of many kinds. 
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For from them there are simple ones, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.  
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them there are blind Hooks: and they are of three kinds.  
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them there are hooks having two curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and from them there are hooks having three curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.  
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of Scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: for from them there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one. 
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their points with which the cutting is done are sharp, other points are not sharp: and they are not put so, unless so that relief may be given in scraping nodes when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that the sick person may be healed by them and find tranquility for a little time from the burning he finds in scraping an abscess.  
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are magdals, and they are of three kinds. 
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of bronze, and they are similar to a ladle, with which alcohol is made; and at the wide end there is a concealed spatulate point; and through it one can direct it inwards, and outwards as you wish, just as you see. 
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The spatulas which are concealed between the fingers at the opening of abscesses; and the sick do not perceive them; and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small. 
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Forms of wind instruments with which the flow of blood is cut off; and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small. 
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of bronze, or brass, round, and somewhat long, as you see; and they should be delicate. 
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that you have these kinds of wind instruments, both large and small, so that you may cut blood quickly when needed, and then when medicine is not present for you.  
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them in cutting blood in every place of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the calves of the legs, and the hip, and the calves of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar ones, from the fleshy calves, humid ones. 
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made into other small instruments similar to pistachio shells, according to their shape; with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this shape. 
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the care of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts. 
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.  
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the nipples of some men swell up during sleep (that is, when they begin to become aroused in their sleep) until they resemble women's breasts; and they remain foul abscesses. 
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever shrinks from that, must cut above the nipples with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then flay off all the fat. 
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with flesh-colored medicine. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture, and care for it until it heals. 
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the nipple inclines downward and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that it be cut in its two upper sides with two similar incisions of a crescent shape, each of which is joined with the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing the smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Then flay off the skin that is between the two lips and remove the fat, and administer what we said about suture and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.  
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you do not complete the incision as needed because of the patient's restlessness or because of bleeding: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.  
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals. 
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the piercing of an abscess which occurs under the nipple.  
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII. 
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur under the nipple are of hard types of Strophulus which contain cysts and those which contain moisture. 
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those therefore that are of the types which contain moisture, must be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form, from line b to line g. When therefore all that is in the abscess is evacuated as pus, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until another day. 
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the cotton and treat it with a suitable ointment for that purpose, until it heals. 
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the kind of nodes called Strophularia, then split it open above itself, just as we said in the section on Strophularia equally. 
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the wound extends so that it emits pus, then apply a cautery to it according as we said in what has been stated before. 
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the incision of an abscess which occurs because of an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX. 
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it consolidates, then very often an abscess arises from that; and similarly it happens with a vein, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it. 
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is recognized that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and a vein are these: because when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there were a creaking sound. 
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round and manifest on the body. 
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And incision of this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large. 
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it is necessary that its treatment be directed with iron and what arises from them also in the extremities, or in the head, must be directed.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore on that which arises from the inflation of the orifice of the artery, make an incision in the skin in length. 
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, then the artery; and free it from the tunics until it is exposed. 
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle under it and make it penetrate up to the other side and tie off the artery with a double thread in two places according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples. 
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a scalpel until all the blood within it exits and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall away; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed. 
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	But if it be an abscess due to the cutting of a vein, then you must hold with your hand as much as possible of the abscess with the skin. 
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you draw it out from the other side. 
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie with the abscess a good ligature; according as I told you about the ligature of a vein, from two parts with two ends of thread. 
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread may be drawn out, then introduce another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the needle; press and tighten your threads in four places. 
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle until what is in it comes out; then cut away excess skin and let that which is tied be released from it.  
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place upon it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil. 
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply treatment, which is made with lint and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning an abscess that occurs from the twisting of Nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter 1. 
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess occurs in nerves; which happens in them by a blow, or from excessive labor, and similar things; and it most often happens in those places where the auxiliaries are, or the heel, and in any place where joints are moved; and the abscess is serious. 
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It resembles the color of the rest of the body and is in many dispositions without pain; and when it is squeezed with vehemence, one feels a weakness in it similar to a stupor. 
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess gathered deep within the body, but rather under the skin, and it moves to every part; and it does not go forward to the front, nor back to the rear. 
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what is among them at the joints should not be entered with iron. 
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps contraction may occur. 
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But for that which is among them on the head or forehead, cut the skin with a scalpel. 
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.  
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and flay it; then remove it, and bring the wound together with suture; and care for it until it heals. 
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the abdomen. 
Caput LI.	Chapter LI. 
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	There sometimes occur in the abdomens of certain men, and in other parts of their bodies, swellings which are called fungal, by similarity to fungi.  
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is slender, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted. 
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small; and some of them grow very large. 
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have indeed already seen a man, and in his abdomen were two swellings which were more like fungi than anything else: there was no difference between them, white, of small root, and their lips were inverted and split, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore I cut into them and found that one weighed about ten and eight ounces and the other about six ounces.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For very often much blood is expelled at its incision; therefore hasten, if blood overpowers you, then cauterize it. 
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	But if you see a weak and timid one shrinking from the incision with a knife, then take a thread made of lead cleanly, and bind it with that thread on the finger: the method of which is what we have said, and let it go for two days. 
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead constriction. 
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease to bind the lead whenever it presses on the fingertip until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort. 
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the fingertip is of a thick root, then there is some fear and trembling in its incision; especially that which is in the abdomen. 
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However it is possible to cut half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it does not grow back. 
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound heals. 
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And be careful not to presume to cut a fingertip that is dark colored, numb, and ugly looking; for it is indeed a cancerous ulcer; and I will come with a remembrance of Cancer after this.  
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of umbilical hernias. 
Caput LII.	Chapter 52. 
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	An umbilical hernia occurs from many causes. 
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or it arises from fissures in the abdominal muscles, which are above the abdomen; and intestines or omentum comes out of them, according to what happens in other ruptures.  
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood flowing from a vein or an artery, according to what was previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from wind confined within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is due to a fissure in the muscles, and there is protrusion of fat; then its color is similar to the color of the body, and it is soft, without pain; and it appears in various positions.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of intestine, then its location, as we have described it, is of a more intense variety. 
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and there is vehement labor. 
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is there constriction, nor is it added. 
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	But if it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears tending toward blackness from the cleavage. 
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to flesh produced: then the abscess is grave, thick, hard, and is fixed according to a single quantity. 
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if it is due to windiness, then its touch is soft.  
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, that you then consider if the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an Artery, or Vein, or windiness: then it is necessary that you prohibit its cure. 
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses are due to artery and vein. 
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	But if the prominence of the navel is due to intestine, or a rupture: then it is necessary that you order the sick person to hold his breath and stand straight extended. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with encausto all around the circumference of the navel.  
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards order him to lie down between your hands on his back. 
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a wide speculum around the navel on top of the place which you marked with encausto.  
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards extend the middle of the abscess upwards, with a large hook. 
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it around firmly with thread, or with a cord from silk ligature: and let the knot of the ligature be away from the incision. 
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the extended middle of the abscess above the ligature.  
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it already seized by a ligament: then draw out the ligature, and insert into it the index finger, and press the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen; and if you find a tumor, then take it up with a hook, and cut off its excess. 
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if it is an artery or vein contrary to you: then bind it very much. 
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation. 
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circumference which you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate. 
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then draw tight the abscess in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the extended flesh rots; and it falls off by itself: or cut it when it softens and decays. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what is necessary from ointments until it heals.  
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if the prominence of the navel is from flesh growing in it, or from moisture; then it is necessary to make concave abscesses as we said.  
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood or moisture which you find in it. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for it with what strengthens the place.  
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Concerning the Care of CANCER. 
Caput LIII.	Chapter Fifty-Three.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already said in the division of species of Cancer, and how the way is to its cure with medicines; and caution should be taken from it with its cure with iron, so that it is not ulcerated; and we have said Cancer generated in the womb, and caution from its cure. 
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where it is possible for its eradication; such as Cancer which is in the breasts or in the thigh, and those similar to them, from the limbs located for extracting all of it; especially when it is beginning and small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	But when it grows old and is large, it is not necessary to approach it. 
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself was unable to heal anyone from it, nor did I see anyone before me who had attained that. 
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in this case, when it is situated as we have said, is to precede and loosen the weak one from the black bile several times. 
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomy itself if you find him with manifest repletion. 
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak one with preparation, in which he should be placed during the operation. 
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw into the cancer hooked instruments which are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then scoop it out from every part with skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow and do not cut it quickly, rather press the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instrument is possible there. 
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the thick flow of blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you: then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining care until it is healed. 
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Concerning the Care of Dropsy. 
Caput LIIII.	Chapter Fifty-Four. 
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already narrated in the division the types of dropsy and how the accumulation of water occurs; and the signs of every type, and its cure with medicines. 
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is no other than the ascites type alone; and it does not approach the tympanitic type with iron nor the hydropic type at all, for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanitic, with medicines and your medication has not been successful, then consider. 
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already overtaken the weak one or there is another ailment with him besides dropsy; such as if there is a cough with it, or loosening of the bowels, and things similar to those: then beware of treating him with iron; for there is fear of that.  
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If however you see a weak one of excessive humor, and there is no illness with him except dropsy alone: and he is neither a boy nor an old man: then the method of operation on him is that you raise the weak one standing between your hands, and the attendant behind him presses his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest. 
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a thorny spathe, according to this form. 
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be long, with two pointed ends, sharp at the extremity like a spathe. 
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let there be some slight shortness in it so that you do not pierce through to the intestines during the operation and injure them. 
Deinde considera.	Then consider. 
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the dropsy is generated from the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen the incision from the navel by the length of three fingers, downwards in its direction above the chest. 
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the dropsy is generated because of a liver ailment, then let your incision be on the left from the navel by three fingers. 
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary for the incision to be on the side where the weak one wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place. 
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin through with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with the spathe between the skin and the flesh, and flay it as if you were skinning it; and let the amount flayed be the size of a nail, or thereabouts. 
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the flesh until the spathe reaches the empty space: and that is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it and insert into the opening an instrument of this form. 
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	It is like a cannula; it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; with a small hole at its lower end and three holes on its sides, two on one side and one on the other; and its extremity is cut in the manner of an incision on a reed, as you see: there is a ring at its upper end. 
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument; therefore, it evacuates from the water in an hour a medium quantity. 
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour through the resolution of his own animal spirit; or he suffers a swoon which approaches death. 
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what the sick person's dispositions signify to you from the strength of his pulse, and from his goodness. 
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.  
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is because it is retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the hole which is above the sifac; about which I have spoken, so that you pierce it according to that method. 
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the next day, if you see the sick person tolerate it; and evacuate also from the water a small quantity. 
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there does not remain from the water except a little. 
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the sick person, and you release much from the water; then care for him with burial in warm sand, and much sweat in a bath and sun, and expect thirst upon him; and care for him with drying medicines until he is healed: and cauterize upon the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water; according to what I have spoken in what precedes. 
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the care of infants who are born with their urine passages not perforated. 
Caput LV.	Chapter 51.  
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When anyone of infants emerges from the belly of its mother, and the head of its penis is not perforated, or the hole is tight, or it is in an improper place. 
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born with a fine Spatula, according to this form.  
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a fine plumb bob into the hole and tie it; and hold it for three or four days. 
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When he therefore wishes to pass urine, remove it and let him urinate. 
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then replace it. 
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in a plumb bob, it is possible that the urine flowing over the place will not allow it to be closed. 
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He whose opening is tight should be treated with a plumb bob, as we said, for many days until it is enlarged. 
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are injured. 
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the head of the penis; therefore he cannot urinate forward until he raises his penis with his own hand upward.  
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation for him because the semen cannot reach the womb according to straightness and it is a very foul disease. 
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation on him is that the sick man should be laid on his back.  
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand by a strong extension and cut the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp knife or lancet; as the incision of a reed, or as you shave something so that its middle comes to resemble the head of the penis; and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should be. 
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware during your operation of the flow of blood.  
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens. 
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore oppose to him something that stops the blood and care for the wound until it is healed.  
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning the diseases which occur in the foreskin and head of the penis and corruption, blackness, and adhesion. 
Caput LVI.	Chapter Fifty-Six.  
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These diseases often occur on the penis and there is a protuberance of foul flesh. 
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it one is malignant and another is not malignant. 
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore the non-malignant one ought to be suspended with a fine hook, and cut off until it is completely cleansed. 
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon it cotton submerged in Egyptian ointment. 
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterwards with dyafinicon ointment until it is healed.  
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	But if the Albather is malignant and foul-colored, then it is necessary to administer a cautery upon it after its incision and excision. 
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	But if the Albather is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and a part of the Albather is between the foreskin and a part is outside: then it is necessary to remove the Albather which is inside first until when it consolidates, then treat that which is outside; because when you treat them together, the foreskin will not be secured from being perforated. 
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also there occur in the testicles a blackness and corruption of the foreskin. 
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore it is necessary that you scoop out all that has already been blackened and what desires to be corrupted or is already corrupted. 
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then smear upon it afterwards with honey which has already been mixed with flour of pomegranate seeds and crushed sieve herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if bleeding should occur, then administer a cautery with a lunar cautery according to this form.  
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for bleeding and for a wound when it becomes corrupted. 
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	But if the head of the penis is eaten away and destroyed altogether within an hour: then it is necessary to insert into the urethra of the penis a cannula made from lead so that the weak one may urinate upon it. 
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	But in the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis; and this adhesion indeed does not occur except in him whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required upon it: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound or an abscess; therefore it is necessary to scrape it away with a blunt Spatula until the ligament is loosened and the head of the penis is freed from every part.  
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these precisely, then you must scrape something from the head of a twig, and from the foreskin. 
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the foreskin is delicate, it may perhaps be perforated quickly on account of its delicacy. 
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not stick together again. 
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with astringent wine until it is consolidated. 
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the cleansing of infants and their treatment when injured by accident.  
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII. 
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds: nevertheless, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is especially in boys, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation and an easier way leading to health. 
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws and it is nothing but what we have acquired through experience.  
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	This is because I have found the greater part of craftsmen and phlebotomists to use cleansing by circumcising with a razor and forceps: and they use alum and ligature with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tried all these methods and found none better than cleansing with forceps and ligature with thread. 
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the foreskin skin has two coats; therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower coat remains: it is then necessary to incise again to cut the other, and pain will ensue. 
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with cleansing which is done by alum, that is, a digital method which tailors use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secure: because it may perhaps enter its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing, however, if the nail is involved, perhaps iron will come out and spoil your operation; and indeed the skin of a child is short by nature and very often they are born like this so that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen this. 
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But cleansing with forceps and tying with thread has proven a good experiment for me; because forceps are proportionate to the incision: therefore, because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below. 
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you apply your hand beforehand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned and they fall according to the single operation at one time; and a compression is made in a similar shape, containing the skin of a stick from every side, with which there is no error at all. 
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of the operation itself is such that you should make a child, especially if he is one who understands a little, understand that you are not doing anything except tying thread on his stick and let him go until another day. 
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be merry in every way possible for him so that he receives his intelligence from it.  
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands in a prepared posture and let him not be sitting; and hide the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments. 
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand towards his stick and blow on the skin and draw it upwards until the head of the stick comes out. 
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from what gathers in it of filth.  
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked spot with a double thread. 
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, tie a little further down a second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature with good retention and cut between the two ligatures. 
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the head of the stick.  
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run gradually (for it is better) and put powder on top: and on the powder a cloth in which an egg yolk boiled in rose water has been spread, shaken with good fresh rose oil; and leave it over it until another day: and take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals. 
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the forceps for cleansing is this. 
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt, and let them converge: so that a clavicle branch does not come out of them: and let the length of the two points be equal to the length of two handles equally. 
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But an error falling in cleansing is this: because perhaps the whole inner skin escapes, or a part of it at the incision. 
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your nail before applying the poultice to the place: and cut it according to equality.  
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then pull it out with a hook, and cut it. 
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days have passed it, and what is under the rod remains swollen, poultice it: then let it be until the poultice becomes hot, and the skin loosens it easily, and cut it according to what is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod. 
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm it. 
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore care for it with what strengthens the wound from powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut from the skin above measure, and extends to the upper parts, it will not harm it either. 
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore care for it with what we have said, until it heals.  
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder. 
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction made from stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar things from those which we have said from the modes of treatment in division.  
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if urine is not passed, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder; then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over on his knees. 
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak one draw in his breath as much as possible for him. 
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, when the neck of the bladder is directed towards the expulsion of the stone to the rear: urine is discharged.  
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	And if it is not passed with what we have said, and the matter is vehement upon the weak one; then it is necessary that you administer extraction of it with an instrument which is called a syringe, which has this form: Let it be of silver, and let it be subtle, smooth, concave like the quill of a bird's feather in the subtlety of a ray, long in the likeness of a palm and a half; to which there should be a subtle cannula at its head. 
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of the exit of urine through it is, that you take a doubled thread and bind wool or tow at its extremity with a good ligature; and insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut off any excess from the wool with forceps, but insert it into the cannula with violence, like an alzer.  
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then smear the syringe with oil, or butter, and egg white; and have the weak one sit upon a seat, and embrocate the bladder and its rod with moist oils, olive oil, and warm water.  
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the rod easily until it reaches the root of the rod. 
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above from the part of the umbilicus.  
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then press the syringe within it until it reaches the bladder, and let the weak one feel that it has already reached the empty thing; and this is not done according to this order unless because the passage in which it goes is where there is a twisting. 
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually. 
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the vein will follow the wool. 
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw it out, and make the vein run along the path of the urine; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do that until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief. 
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of the washing out of the bladder with a Clepshydra. 
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX. 
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is constricted in it, and you wish to distill waters and medicines into it; then let it be done with an instrument which is called a Clepshydra, and this is its form. 
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is deaf, that is, closed.  
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see. 
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is that which propels it, be according to the quantity which it will expel itself without addition, until when it is drawn with it something, from moisture it is attracted: and when it is propelled, with it it is expelled afar: according to what the clepshydra does, by which naptha is projected, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.  
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to project moisture into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the clepshydra into the moisture, and draw with it that which propels it upwards, for the moisture is attracted into the concavity of the clepshydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its extremity into the urethra, according to what we have related in the syringe.  
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then propel the moisture with that which propels it; for the moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it. 
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a delicate clyster by which the bladder is washed out. 
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or electrum; whose head be higher like a small spoon, and under it a sinus into which a ligature may fall.  
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a bladder of a ram and put into it the moisture with which you wish to irrigate the bladder. 
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two folds with a strong ligature using double thread, and warm that moisture a little over the fire. 
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the clyster into a rod, then tighten your hand over the bladder with moisture with decent compression until the weak person feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder. 
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it through all its roundness.  
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert strong thread into those holes, as they revolve. 
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle as it is gathered as a bandage; after you put in it what you wish from moistures and oils and waters. 
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it on the instrument; and do with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder. 
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the Extraction of a Stone.  
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already said in the division the species of stone and its treatment with medicine, and I said the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of it all; and I said the stone in which the operation falls with the hand and section; and there is a stone generated properly in the bladder; and that which is lodged in the urethra; and I am relating that with manifest exposition and abbreviation. 
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most often happens to boys.  
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among the signs of it is that urine goes out from the bladder like water in its subtlety; and there appears in it white sand, and the weak man rubs his urethra, and labors with it, and very often hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then he becomes erect, and goes out with it the anus in many of them. 
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of boys is easy, until they reach fourteen years. 
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old men. 
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young men it is intermediate, in that which is between those things; and of him whose stone is larger, healing is easier; and if small, the care is the opposite. 
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore when we come to the healing, it is necessary first of all that we cleanse the sick person with an enema, which extracts all the dung that is in his intestines; for it sometimes hinders the discovery of the stone in the examination. 
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick person be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved downward so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or jumps from a high place several times.  
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his own hips so that the whole bladder becomes sloping downwards. 
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then inquire of him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	Therefore if you feel the stone in a space, then hurry immediately with an incision above it. 
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall at all under your touch, then you must smear the index finger with oil from the left hand, if the sick person is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a grown young man; and introduce it into his anus, and inquire about the stone until it stands under your finger, and turn him gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards towards the place where you wish for the incision; and instruct a minister to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another minister to extend the testicles with his right hand upward; and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the section is. 
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce an incizing speculum whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock; and let the incision be above it on a stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the external incision is wide and the internal one is tight, according to the quantity so that the exit of the stone from it is not greater. 
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it exits without difficulty. 
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from a stone which has angles and edges, therefore its exit is difficult because of that. 
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is smooth, like a gland, and round: and its exit is easy. 
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore to him who has angles and edges, add to the fissure.  
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	But if it does not exit this way, then it is necessary that you ingeniously place something above it: or tie a string above it with a decent gesture, whose extremity is like the moon, which will bind above the stone and will not slip from it; or insert a subtle instrument of curved extremity under it. 
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you are unable to do so above it, then enlarge the opening a little.  
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	But if something from the blood overcomes you, cut it off with a lancet. 
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if there is more than one stone, then first drive the largest one to the opening of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it. 
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards drive the small one after it, and similarly do if there are more than two. 
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	But if it is very large, it is ignorance to make a section above it large.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the weak one of two things, either that he dies, or that there occurs to him a constant distillation of urine: because the place does not consolidate at all. 
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Rather administer its expulsion until it exits: or ingeniously break it with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense and aloes and dragon's blood; and bind it up, and lay over it a cloth steeped in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that a hot poultice may be formed. 
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then place the patient on his back upon his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.  
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you unloose it, embrocate the place with water and much oil. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed. 
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if it should happen that a hot abscess is added to the wound, and corrosion, and things similar to these; such as if the blood should congeal in the bladder and urine be prevented from it; and this is known from the issuing of blood with the urine.  
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood. 
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it leads to the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.  
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply to it everything suitable for its cure until it is healed. 
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the course of the whole treatment that you should bind both thighs and shins, because of the medicines which are placed upon the spot. 
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	But if the stone is small and is in the urethra and is fixed there and prevents the urine from passing out; then treat it with what I have related before you come to section. 
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Very often indeed you are excused from section by this treatment, for I have already proved it.  
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is that you should take a perforator of alferic iron, which has this form: triangular point, sharp, fixed in wood. 
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie the penis with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the penetrating iron into the urethra with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself; and revolve the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually; and try to make perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side. 
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For then urine is immediately discharged. 
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the urethra. 
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it itself is broken, and goes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.  
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not prepared for you because of something which prevents it: then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone. 
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone in the urethra itself between the two ligatures. 
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it. 
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards untie the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood, which is made in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread below the stone unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and the other thread above unless so that when the thread is untied after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place and the wound heals; and for this reason it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, that you lift the skin upwards so that it returns to your complement and heals the wound as we said. 
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Concerning the Extraction of Stones from Women. 
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI. 
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Few stones are generated in women. 
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if it should happen to any of them that a stone occurs, then the cure is difficult and is forbidden because of many ways. 
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is that the woman perhaps is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to the doctor when she is chaste or from those having husbands. 
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is because you do not find a woman well-knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand. 
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	The fourth is the distance from the stone's location: therefore it requires deep incision, and there is danger in that. 
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity provokes that, then it is fitting that you take a female physician, well-knowing: and few are found. 
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you deprive her of those things, then seek a chaste physician, subtle, and present a female midwife well-taught in the matter of women, or a woman who inclines toward this art: therefore make her present, and especially instruct her to do all that you command her from inquiry about the stone. 
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, it is necessary that she look to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is fitting that she insert a finger into her anus and seek the stone. 
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, let her constrict it under her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the infirm woman and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder and compresses it with good pressure. 
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that gradually she move it from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts with all her strength until it arrives with it at the root of the thigh. 
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then let her cut above it at the opposition of the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever part she prepares it and feels the stone in that part: and let her finger not be removed from the stone, constricting under it: and let the incision be small at first. 
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then let her insert a ray over that incision. 
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore she feels the stone, then let her add to the incision according to the proportion of quantity as the stone goes forth from it. 
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones. 
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these indeed there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore know its kind, so that it may be shown to you by this concerning that which you wish. 
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place triticum flour, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is cut off. 
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out; and do that you prepare for yourself from the instruments which I said in the extraction of a stone in men, so that you may help through them in your operation. 
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with powders a decent binding; and do not change that; and leave the stone, and do not extract it.  
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the weak woman may die. 
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound. 
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of blood subsides after days, and the place festers, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out. 
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Concerning the incision for a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not anything but a gathering of moisture in the tunica albuginea, which is under the skin containing the testicle; and it is called the tunica albuginea. 
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in the panniculus itself which nature has prepared for it in that part, until it swells: which is another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the tunica albuginea, which we said; and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation indeed of this hernia is from a weakening which occurs in the testicles; therefore this matter flows to them. 
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors. 
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its color is inclined to a citron yellow, or it is bloody red, or fecal black, or it is watery white, and that is what is more common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where there is a collection of water are these. 
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white part that we mentioned, then it is a round abscess somewhat in length like the shape of an egg; and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every side. 
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own pouch, then the abscess is round with a part like an egg, and because of this a man thinks it is another egg. 
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white part, then it falls below sensation. 
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore when you wish to know the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with a square instrument, whose shape has preceded. 
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that therefore which comes out in the track of the Instrument, judge concerning that which is between it. 
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, it is necessary that you direct the sick person to be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body full. 
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he is laid on his back upon something high a little, and put under him many cloths. 
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you upon his left, and direct the assistant to sit at his right, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles and to the part near the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad speculum and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle through the length, as far as near the pubic bone; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles until it reaches the white part comprehending; and flay this and observe, or be careful from this so that you do not cut this: and let your flaying be such that by which you flay this, on the side which hangs with the egg more: and carefully scrutinize with the flaying according to the quantity which is possible for you.  
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the full bladder with a wide perforation and extract all the water. 
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks and extend the bladder upwards, and do not touch the skin enveloping the testicles; and incise the bladder in any way possible for you to incise it, either with its entirety or in parts, especially its thin side. 
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not meticulously examine it, there is no safety in its incision lest the water return. 
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the external testicle proceeds from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the bladder, replace it. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with suture. 
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like other wounds until it heals.  
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if you find the testicle corrupted from blackness or another cause, then it is necessary to tie off the vessels which are the spermatic cord, fearing a flow of blood.  
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its spermatic cord and extract the testicle; afterward care for it as we have said.  
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if the water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches; therefore cut off the other part as you did to the other equally.  
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it seems right to you for there to be one operation, then do so; then wash away the blood. 
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and put outside other wool than that which you submerged in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the belly; and put double cloths on top of these, and they are poultices; and tie them on top with a bandage having six folds according to this form.  
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths and soak them and fill them with carminated bran according to this similarity; and let their ends be those by which they are pressed from the elbow, or damp wool; and gather them together with a binding at the lumbar region of the arms; and let one end receive upon the anus up to the back, and let the second receive upon the region of the chest; and let two ends be upon the two thighs below, and let the other two ends be upon the two groins, and let the whole binding be gathered in the lumbar region of the arms. 
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this wound is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of incision with an iron; and it is such that you should take a sharp knife-cautery and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and it is ignited according to what we have said: until when white pus containing water is revealed: then take a cautery, in this shape. 
Assimilatur literae graecae.	Greek letters are assimilated. 
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce that pus with it, and ignite it until all the moisture comes out. 
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the pus with hooks, and flay it with a thin ignited cautery, and cut it according to what is possible for you, until you root out all of it. 
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful that the fire does not touch it. 
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and farther from a flow of blood, and better than the operation with incision. 
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if it causes you opposition in the hour of incision, or in the hour of cautery a hot abscess, or a flow of blood, or anything else: then it is necessary that you cure what opposition it causes you from it with the care that suits it, according to what has been said before. 
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if he is weak and fearful, and does not await this operation because of its horror: then administer a perforation according to what I narrate that: and it is.  
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is confirmed to you that by that which we have said of the significations, that the wound is watery: then it is necessary for you to make the weak one sit on a raised seat. 
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in the lower part of it with a broad spatula; and place the piercing according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water runs out. 
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a compress on the place and bind it, and let it be so that the remaining water runs out; then care for it until the wound is healed.  
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if the opposition is to the water's escape in the hour that you pierce it, and this is not except because the white panniculus makes opposition at the wound's orifice, and prohibits the exit of the water, then it is necessary that you introduce a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which water from hydrops patients is extracted, whose shape precedes: or add a little to the operation of the wound. 
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and gathers after six months, or thereabouts. 
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	Therefore when it gathers, then it is perforated in the same way, and the weak man will pass his days. 
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Concerning the treatment of fleshy branches. 
Caput LXIII.	Chapter Sixty-Third. 
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the section over this branch, there is fear leading to destruction in many constitutions. 
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its dismissal is saving from it. 
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation on it and the kind of abscess.  
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, therefore, that many abscesses occur in bodies, from which testicles are composed, and this happens for many reasons, namely. 
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Either from acute or sharp superabundance, which is poured onto the testicles.  
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow. 
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body and pain is not found in it: and the abscess is grave. 
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark brown, and there is no sensation in it.  
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it occurs from the knotting of arteries and their inflation, as already previously remembered; or from the inflation of veins. 
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is from them by inflation of arteries, is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess when you compress it with your fingers.  
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary to touch it completely. 
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is done by the inflation of veins, nothing is dispersed from it upon compression with fingers. 
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section be made on this kind and the remaining flesh, and it is to cut the skin of the testicles. 
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the testicle upward and extract it with white silk; and free the spermatic cord from the vessels and tie off the vessels; and cut the spermatic cord after you free it from every part of the parts of the testicle.  
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the testicle is consolidated with those flesh born with it then it is necessary that you draw out the testicle and cut it. 
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something of the spermatic cord or in that which is between the vessels then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision. 
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is a natural growth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind then it is necessary that you cut all of it and extract the testicle as we said.  
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete then fill the wound with lint steeped in rose oil and wine; then care for it with the remaining care until it heals.  
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Concerning the Care of Branch Wounds which are with Vine. 
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Hydrocele is a swelling enveloped by a certain involution, like a hernia, with softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult movement and exercise, and walking upon the weak person.  
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this disease there is fear because of that of which we have previously made mention. 
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary that we say that the operation in it should be according to what the first did.  
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I therefore say that it is necessary that you make the weak person sit upon an elevated seat. 
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then press the spermatic cord of the testicles downward.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, together with the veins that are near the penis; and let another assistant hold them, and extend them with a vigorous extension. 
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a broad, sharp scalpel in a transverse section in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are exposed. 
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then flay the skin from every part, as we told you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.  
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix a needle into them, in which there is a doubled thread; and tie it in the first of the places where the veins occur; and tie it again in the last of them. 
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in a straight section in the middle according to the length of the body, and extract what is collected from foul, corrupted humors. 
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound as you would care for other wounds, in which you wish to generate pus, so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles may fall away. 
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not bad through that. 
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it should happen to the vein with all the veins, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted along with the veins so that the testicle is not deprived of nourishment because of the incision, and waste away, or become scorched, and there be no benefit with them. 
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Concerning the care of the branches of the intestines. 
Caput LXV.	Chapter Sixty-Fifth.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The occurrence of this branches is from a section that happens in the extended abdomen above the belly in the groin part of the belly. 
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles. 
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the abdomen or extension thereof.  
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds occur from many causes; either from a blow or a jump or a shout or lifting a heavy thing and the like. 
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from an extension of the abdomen.  
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It happens gradually over a long time and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal towards the depth: because the sifach compresses the intestine. 
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign when it is from the section of the sifach, because it causes to happen from its beginning intense pain suddenly: and it is a different abscess, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach. 
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it issues forth with intestine pus: and this is called intestinal Ramex and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence. 
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces runs into the intestine and is retained there: and with it there is danger to the sick person: because it causes severe pain to happen, and especially when it is pressed. 
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these kinds of sicknesses with iron there is fear: therefore it is necessary that one be cautious in this matter. 
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is, that you order the sick person to reduce the intestine with his own hand into the interior of its cavity, if it obeys return.  
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he is laid down on his back between your hands; and his legs are raised. 
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut all the skin of the testicles along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to how you need to open the incision with them: and the incision should be according to the quantity which is possible so that an egg can come out from it.  
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the siphash, and what are under the skin of the testicles, until when the white siphash is uncovered, hard on every side: then introduce your index finger into it which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphash, which is under the skin, and the second siphash: and loosen with it the adhesion which is in the back part of the testicle.  
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inner skin of the testicles and while doing so stretch the white silk upwards with your left hand; and lift the testicle with the silk towards the section part, and tell the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards; and you loosen the adhesion which is behind after the complete solution. 
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers that there is nothing therein from the intestine unraveled in the hard white silk. 
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find anything from it, then press it down towards the lower abdomen. 
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle in which there is a thick thread made of licorice from ten threads and insert it at the last silk that is, the tunic which is under the skin of the testicles following the section; then cut off the ends which protrude from the thread until there are four threads. 
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over some with a figure which is in the manner of a cross and tie them with the silk which we mentioned because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligament until none of the vessels which nourish them can send anything to them so that a hot abscess does not occur from there. 
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it by less than two fingers. 
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures dismiss from the silk which is under the skin of the testicles a quantity of the size of a finger and cut the remainder entirely according to its roundness and remove the testicle from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles with a section from which blood and pus flow as we have related in what precedes. 
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound; and administer the ligature which we have related.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white silk which we mentioned is cauterized after its incision fearing the flow of blood.  
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Very often it happens. 
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligature until it falls off by itself. 
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its falling is delayed, then embrocate it with warm water and place that which we said upon it until it falls. 
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the remaining care of wounds until it is healed. 
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning a windy branch.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter Sixty-six.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this branch I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron. 
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first indeed they said that it is done as we narrated in the branch which is with a vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is, to tie the vessels after section above them with ease below: then cut in the middle and finally care for it with that which opens it up until the vessels fall off: and care for the wound according to what we said until it heals. 
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning a disruption which occurs in the groins. 
Caput LXVII.	Chapter Sixty-seven.  
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins as we said and the place protrudes and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends it is a little and returns in all hours: but if time prolongs with it, a fissure is added into the inguinal region until the intestines descend into the inguinal region.  
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the inguinal region which is in the groins as we said. 
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the inguinal region is extended: then it softens and the place becomes inflamed and protrudes.  
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with a cautery as its previous narration preceded. 
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cared for with iron according to this manner: and it is that the sick person lies on their back between your hands.  
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the inflamed and protruding place of the rupture by a width according to the quantity of three fingers. 
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then bind the ligature and what is under the skin until a white vein, which follows it, appears. 
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a lancet and place it upon the prominent spot from the vein and press it deep into the abdomen. 
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then make two prominent spots above the end of the lancet from the vein and join them together with a suture; then withdraw the end of the lancet. 
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the vein at all, nor strain the egg, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of a ruptured intestine. 
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with wound care. 
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it and restore the wound until it consolidates.  
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the vein will contract and no prominence of rupture will be added. 
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place; for it is nearer to safety.  
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles. 
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII. 
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Very often the skin of the testicles is softened in certain men, on account of which the flesh between them is softened and its appearance is marred. 
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is consulted in its treatment to make the sick man lie on his back and cut away all the softened skin upon the natural skin. 
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he will bring together the two lips with a suture; and if you wish, first make three or four sutures on the excess softened skin and secure the sutures.  
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures. 
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat it with the care of other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall away.  
¶ De Castratione.	Concerning castration. 
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX. 
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law and for this reason it would be permissible for me not to remember it in this book of mine; and there is no need to recall it except for two reasons. 
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of them is that it be in the knowledge of medicine when questioned about it, and that he know its cure to which it happens. 
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another way is that we very often need the castration of certain animals for our benefits through it, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals. 
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that castration is done according to two methods. 
Aut per attritionem.	Or by abrasion. 
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by fissure and incision. 
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	But in that which is done by abrasion, the way of the operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles are softened and made pliable, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to the touch. 
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.  
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament and cut above the whole testicle with one incision until when two testicles proceed: then incise them after you have skinned both, and do not leave anything above them except a fine silk thread which is above the vessels. 
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by abrasion: because abrasion may perhaps leave something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires copulation. 
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.  
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Concerning the care of hermaphrodites in two ways. 
Caput LXX.	Chapter Seventy.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from males according to two methods. 
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in it that there follows a space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles. 
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women there is one species, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubic bone just like the testicles of a man small indeed, prominent externally: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two are like two testicles. 
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three species, two from men and one species from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut away the added flesh until the impression of them escapes.  
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for them with the treatment of other wounds. 
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But in the second species of men, from which urine flows out, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all. 
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the Incision of a Tent-like Structure and Prominent Flesh in the Vulva of Women. 
Caput LXXI.	Chapter Seventy-One. 
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	A tent-like structure perhaps is added on top of the natural part until its appearance becomes ugly and foul: and sometimes it magnifies in certain women so much that it expands like in men, and reaches as far as intercourse. 
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore it is necessary that you hold the excess of the tent-like structure with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it; and do not stop in the incision, especially in the depth of the root: so that bleeding does not occur. 
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. 
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the flesh that arises is flesh which is born in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it protrudes outwardly according to the likeness of a tail; and because of this, some of the ancients name the ailment tailed. 
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that we cut it just as we cut the tent-like structure, and care for it until it heals.  
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the Treatment of Atresia, Which Is an Imperforate Vulva. 
Caput LXXII.	Chapter Seventy-Two. 
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Atresia is when the vulva of a woman is not perforated, or when there is a small opening.  
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental. 
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	It is accidental from a preceding illness and it indeed arises either from added flesh, or a thin or thick ulcer and it occurs either in the depth of the matrix, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or its lower part; and it prevents coitus, impregnation, childbirth and perhaps menstruation. 
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And recognition of it is made by the midwife's inspection if the suture is an apparent approach.  
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent then seek it with your fingers or a probe. 
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the suture is from a thin ulcer and is near both lips then hasten and disrupt it. 
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is necessary to place poultices upon the two lips.  
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place the index fingers of both your hands together and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread. 
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with force until the thin ulcer is disrupted and the suture is opened.  
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it upon the spot, and let the woman come every day so that the place does not consolidate with other fluids.  
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the ulcer is large and thick then it is necessary to cut it out with a broad spatula like a myrtle leaf.  
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the suture is from added flesh then suspend it with hooks and cut into it and have with you medications which stop the flow of blood without biting such as acacia, dragon's blood, and litharge mixed with albumen. 
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then insert a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not consolidate quickly, and hold it for several days; then administer linen cerate from dry flax, and then let the rest be cared for until it is healed.  
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes other flesh growths are born within the matrix; therefore it is necessary that they be cut according to this method: but if there is a cancerous abscess then an abscess which is cancerous within the matrix should not at all be opposed with iron. 
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil and Bothor rubeae in the vulvas of women. 
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter Seventy-Three. 
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed the open orifices of veins, from which much blood constantly flows. 
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Therefore when hemorrhoids become ancient they become thelil and as I have already said in the division of their kinds and signs, I will say here which receive cure from them and which do not. 
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I therefore say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the uterus and do not appear to the sense, then there is no cure for them with iron. 
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those however which are from them in the orifice of the uterus on which sense falls are those that are cured.  
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you introduce the woman into a cold house. 
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the athehelil with forceps or with a rough cloth and cut them out from their roots. 
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over them at the flow of blood from one of the cutting powders without modification: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and those similar to them. 
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards place her in cold water. 
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	And if the flow of blood persists then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate rinds, and galls, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back. 
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is cut off with it, it is good and if not, make the windy ones adhere to the back and breasts without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and submerge it in the juice of tarathit or the juice of arnoglossa or the juice of the branches of alaula which is aglanter, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the place. 
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when the abscess is quiet, care for the place with ointments until it heals. 
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	But albarth is reddish and similar to the heads of alfalfa, and has a rough appearance. 
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that you cut out what appears from it, according to what I said in the chapter equally; and care for it until it heals. 
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the Perforation of a Fistula Which Occurs in the Womb. 
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter Seventy-Four.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and hot abscess.  
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already said all these diseases and their kinds, and their signs, and their treatments in the division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about a hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is from abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with an iron instrument.  
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary that you consider. 
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with percussion, and burning, and fever; and you see it reddening; if numbness falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation; and care for it with that which helps with its maturation, until when the sharpness of the accidents subsides. 
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit upon a seat which beats two seats, and recline, or lean upon her back, and gather her feet to the lower part of her belly; and let her hips be spread, and put her arms under her knees, and bind each one with a suitable ligament to it. 
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit from her right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the womb is opened.  
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes in those which are behind. 
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with the Speculum deep in the matrix of the woman: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the matrix, and injures the delicate parts.  
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is more than deep, then it is necessary that you place pledgets upon the covering of the deep matrix: so that entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the matrix is prohibited: and it is necessary that you place a knob, which runs in the instrument, from its upper side: and that you hold the instrument, and that the attendant turns the knob until the deep matrix is opened.  
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	Therefore when the Cervix appears and is touched by the hand, and it is soft and pliable: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula. 
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	Therefore when the blood is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place a linen cloth steeped in rose oil or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the linen cloth, and draw out the incision into the depth of the matrix.  
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally upon the matrix, and upon the comb clean wool steeped in water, in which apples have been boiled. 
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be cared for after two days with ointment which suits it, until it is healed.  
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the matrix and wound are washed, so that it is cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of a lily or long birthwort has been boiled: then return to ointment. 
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	But if the wound is hidden interiorly within the matrix, then it is necessary that you withhold from its treatment with iron, but rather treat it with what we said in the division. 
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrine of Obstetrics, how living embryos are treated, according to a figure not natural.  
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXXV. 
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for a midwife to know first the form of natural childbirth. 
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, from these signs it is so that when you see a woman pressing down towards her lower parts, and she desires to smell the air, and relief comes over her about the matter of childbirth upon her, and she hastens the exit of the embryo: then you know that this childbirth is according to the natural form, and its exit is upon its head, and secondarily with it; or suspended, or hanging from the umbilical cord. 
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore when you see these signs, it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends quickly.  
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon its head, the second child descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluities by a good cleansing. 
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But that which is besides this childbirth is unnatural, undesirable. 
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus exits upon its feet, and its body exits before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one of its feet; or its head and hands exit; or its belly exits; and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar undesirable figures.  
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary for a midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how its nature is in it, and let it be signified by that, and let it stand upon it. 
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus exits upon its head in its natural exit, and it becomes vehement upon the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened; then make her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her; and apply vapors to her vulva with decocted fenugreek, and with moist oils.  
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and bind it with the second child, and cut it with her fingernail until what is in it runs out from moisture; and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends. 
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then she must be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesamum oil. 
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her after the enema to be compressed; and make her snore while she is being compressed, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. 
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will immediately come out. 
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	But if two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary that you reduce them gradually with ease. 
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey upon entering, then place the woman on a seat and elevate her feet upward; then strike the seat upon the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the impact. 
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	But if the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies, then cut them open and extract the remaining fetus; and tie his hand with a cloth and pull it out evenly, for it will come out itself. 
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The delivery of an embryo on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards equalize it. 
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then let him take hold of one of its feet and extend it gradually.  
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge up to the hips, then order her to be compressed and make her snore while she is being compressed; for it will come out if God wills. 
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have related, then reduce the fetus gradually until you place it according to its natural form.  
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then come out with an easy delivery. 
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is hindered with all that we have related, then take fenugreek mucilage and sesamum oil, and dissolved gum; and strike the whole in a mortar with good percussion; then mix it with the vulva of the woman and below her belly. 
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then have her sit in warm water until the hypocondrium is reached. 
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that her lower parts are already heated, then give her a suppository of myrrh and insert it.  
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore she has held the suppository for an hour, then have her sit upon a seat. 
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then have her strain; and bind her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of the belly with a gentle compression.  
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will immediately come out. 
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it exits according to this form, then begin gently inserting your hands. 
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman is turned onto her neck, and her feet hang down to the lower part; and she lies upon the bed, and folds her hands. 
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press upon her belly gently.  
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under her feet from the pillows until it is prepared in the lower part. 
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	But if the fetus does not exit, then take hold of her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.  
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press upon what is above the hypocondrium gently until the fetus ascends to the upper parts. 
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let her insert her hands and equalize the fetus gently; and instruct the woman to compress until the fetus exits. 
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands. 
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Begin by reducing her hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if she cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and have her walk. 
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then have her lie upon the bed and strike her legs with a vigorous concussion. 
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you prepared from gums.  
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	But if she receives labor pains, then have her sit upon a seat. 
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and equalize the swelling according to the natural shape; and have the woman cough, and instruct her to compress herself until it comes out. 
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over its neck, with hands spread, and its face toward the back of its mother.  
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary for the midwife to hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it and align it with ease. 
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When, therefore, it is aligned, then place on its vulva what we have described made of oil and mucilages. 
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move gradually.  
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then have her sit upon a seat and instruct her to lean towards her right side. 
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to compress herself; and have her cough when it is condensed.  
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus over its side. 
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the orifice of the matrix in this way with the secundina, then cut the secundina with your fingernail until it is evacuated from moisture. 
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it therefore hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies. 
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus toward the interior until you place it according to what is necessary; and instruct the woman to compress herself several times: for it itself will exit with an easy passage. 
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The Exit of Twins, or Many Fetuses. 
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins very often are born; and sometimes three, and four are born.  
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is extraordinary and rarely happens. 
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five is a thing against nature and they do not live entirely; and it contains them, however many they may be, with one secundina; and they are separated by the sifach, distinguishing between them the ligature in the navel of each of them.  
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they exit as easily as a fetus exits naturally; and sometimes they exit with an unfortunate outcome, as we have described. 
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	But if some of them are difficult at childbirth and reach that which we said of unnatural figures, then care for them as we have described: and let there be a skilled midwife, and let her do what she does with ease and delay, and devise according to every shape with that which is prepared for her by ingenuity leading to health. 
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and miscarry. 
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has already been verified by me that a woman miscarrying emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed. 
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.  
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this must be in the knowledge of Obstetrics. 
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For perhaps she may come across one like that; therefore oppose to her what is necessary.  
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus. 
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter Seventy-Six. 
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus with what I said in the division from medication, and it does not exit, and you are forced to use surgery with your hand, then it is necessary that you consider.  
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound health and is not with any accidents from which her loss is feared: then it is necessary that the woman be laid on her back on a bed, and let her head be inclined downwards, and let her legs be raised; and let assistants hold her from two sides, or let her be tied to the bed so that her body is not pulled out at the extraction of the fetus.  
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with oily substances with a decoction of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed.  
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife shall anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she shall introduce it into the womb easily. 
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she shall seek with it a place in which to fasten the hooks from the fetus, and places suitable for that. 
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head; then fix the hooks into its eyes, or into its neck, or into its mouth, or into its palate, or under its beard, or into its clavicle, or into places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria. 
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is upon its feet, then into its breastbone, and its middle ribs. 
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand; and place the curve of it into that which is between the fingers of her left hand; and introduce it with her hand easily, and fasten the hook into one of those places which we have said until she reaches a void space. 
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she shall fasten opposite it another hook, or a third if necessary; so that there be equal contraction and it does not incline to one side.  
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let there not be extension according to straightness only, but rather let it be moved to every side so that its exit is eased; just as is done when extracting a tooth.  
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that in that which is between it, the extension be softened. 
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	But if a part is retained from it, then the midwife must anoint certain fingers with oil and introduce them from the side so that she may turn what is retained with them. 
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	Therefore if a part of the fetus exits, then let the hooks be changed to another place which is higher; do this until the whole fetus exits. 
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	Therefore if the hand exits before the other parts and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction; then a cloth must be wrapped over it. 
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until the whole thing comes out, cut it either at the junction of the sole or on the elbow: and thus you must do in one hand, and in both feet. 
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the head of the fetus is large, or constriction occurs at the outlet, or there is water collected in its head: then it is necessary that you insert the Spatumile spinosum between your fingers, and pierce the head with it, and extract the water: or break it up with an instrument called Almisdac: the form of which comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which follows this. 
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, it is necessary that you make an incision with an algengemat: or extract it with a misdach, as we have said. 
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw out the bones with forceps. 
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	But if the head comes out, and is constricted at the fork: then pierce it until the moisture which is in the chest flows out. 
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it does not become entangled, nor yield to the outlet: then cut the head into pieces as best you can.  
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	But if there is an abscess below the belly, or there is dropsy in it: then you must pierce it until the moisture runs out of it. 
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is on its feet, then its attraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the uterus is slight.  
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is constricted at the belly or chest: then you must extract it with a cloth which you have put over your hand: and pierce the belly or chest until what is in them runs out.  
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns: then let the midwife insert her left hand. 
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	Therefore, if the mouth of the uterus is open, let her insert her hand deep into the uterus, and seek out the head with it, and draw it up to the mouth of the uterus with her fingers: then let her insert one hook or two hooks into it and draw it out with them. 
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mouth of the uterus is constricted due to a hot abscess that occurs there, then it is not necessary for him to work on it, but rather he should then administer a pouring-on of humid and fatty things, and apply poultices, and sit in waters which soften and moisten. 
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it may be straightened; then let what we said about the living fetus be administered. 
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	But if that is not possible, then let it be cut in pieces, and taken out.  
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything from the secundines inside at all. 
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	Therefore when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses which occur in uteruses. 
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood should happen, then let her descend into astringent waters and administer the remaining care.  
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have indeed already seen a woman in whose belly a fetus had died, then she became pregnant again on top of it with another, afterwards the other fetus also died. 
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore it happened to her after a long time that an abscess occurred in her navel and it became swollen until it opened and began to emit pus. 
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called for her care and I treated her for a long time, and the wound did not consolidate.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore I put on it some poultices of strong attraction and an opening came out in its place. 
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed and another opening came out.  
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I therefore wondered because there was no opening in the belly. 
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.  
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore examined the wound and extracted many bones with the woman being in a better state; and she now lives thus for a long time, and emits little pus from its place. 
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	I did not include this here except because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the craftsman physician administers with his hand from healing. 
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of instruments necessary in the extraction of a fetus. 
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter Seventy-Seven. 
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Below is the form of a Strictor, by which books are equaled, to which are equally two vortices at the two ends of two pieces of wood.  
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, these Vortices ought to be more subtle than the Strictor: and so it is made, either from ebony or boxwood.
