O you, very dear children, I have completed this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, along with its fulfillment, and have made the end through its expositions and its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I would complete it with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery.
And because the work of hands is very strong in our region and is entirely strange, the science is lost and cut off, and nothing remains of its strength except for the small descriptions in books by the ancients that the hands have changed. And from this has come the error and the vanity, and the intentions are closed and the science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I want to give it life along with the organization of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and will come together the forms of the cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work with the addition of the declaration and preparation of them, as is necessary.
And because no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distant. And he who undertakes this must excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the joints of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and their number, and the movement and of the moving and resting veins, and of the place of their exit.
And for this reason, Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the aforementioned things must guard themselves so that they do not fall into error and kill men;
just as I have seen many of those who meddle with this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish man who opened an abscess of scrofulous sores on a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; so much blood flowed out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And saw another man who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; and took away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and I saw the patient's condition and the size of the stone, and knew well that if it were cut, he would die.
And I saw another man who treated a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break there was a wound;
and the inexperienced man bound the break over the wound with strong bandages, and did not remove any of the dirt from the wound, and left it like that for a while.
and told him not to untie it.
and it remained like that until his leg, foot, and ankle swelled and he was lost.
I was called to come to him, and hastened to come and untie his leg; and when I had untied it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
But nonetheless, the corruption had already taken hold in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption continued to spread through the limb until the entire limb was lost.
And I saw another case where a festering abscess burst, and then inflamed due to the malice of its lord.
For a chancre, when it is purged of melancholic humor, one should not touch it with iron unless it is in a place where all that is corrupted can be removed.
And therefore, my good son, you need to know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in many ways;
and I will show in each place in this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore, it is necessary that you guard yourselves so that foolish onlookers cannot speak ill of you.
If you take up your work cautiously, and undertake your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that through God's grace you may come to their health and be praised;
and leave the frightful diseases of grievous illness;
and remove your weapons from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourselves so that you may pass from this world to the next with glory.
Galen said in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake the treatment of a serious illness unless you are called a foolish doctor.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is about cauteries with fire and cauteries with sharp medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and of the tools for cauterization, and of everything necessary for the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of arrow extraction, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and shows the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and twists, and similar things;
and is ordered from the head down to the feet, and of the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I say the quality of the help and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help, and of harm, are the longest speech and the most subtle science and the secret kept.
and about this, many wise men spoke, and agreed on this.
And their words suffice me little, for I fear length.
I say that cautery helps universally to every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions. that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a hot and dry complexion with matter, some debated and said that cautery is a great help there. and others said the opposite. that cautery is not worth anything for illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and it should not be used to treat a hot illness by heat, nor by dryness.
And the one who said the opposite claimed that cautery is a great help for hot and dry illnesses that occur in people's bodies. For when you compare the body of the man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it to be so on several occasions by experiment.
And in any case, do not intervene except the one who has experienced it, and who knows through long usage the chapter on cauteries, and the diversity of human temperaments, and the predispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the time of day.
Of other temperaments we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the doctors gathered together and agreed on cautery.
And know, son, that cautery using fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and it does not harm anything except the limb that is being cauterized, and it does little harm to other limbs.
Burning medicines spread from one limb to another, and cause serious illnesses in the limbs. and perhaps kill the sick person.
Fire, due to its intensity and good substance, does not cause harm unless there is an excess.
And this I have found through experiment and the length of service and study I have put into the art, and it is based on the truth of things.
And for this I apologise for the length of the speech, for it does not please me that I deprive you of the secret that is hidden in fire, and the nature of the work, how it drives away illnesses of the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating. or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauteries should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the harm arising is put under by the help of cautery; and especially if the cauteries are necessary for pains, quickly and urgently, so that the time when greater harm comes to the limb cannot be waited for.
And do not think about it, dear son, as fools do. for a disease cured by cautery has no return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not as they think, because cauteries are only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is more valuable than other medicines because of its speed, and because of the virtue of its work and its power.
And it is possible that the disease comes sometimes according to the complexion of the sick person and the location of the disease and its power;
and are gathered in him the superfluities through the acquisition of foods and similar things, if it is not cauteries administered in a place where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cauteries for toothache, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens little.
And many people do not understand why cauteries are called the last resort of medicine, and that is true;
but they do not believe that cauteries are worthwhile after medicine, but their intentions are false, and cauteries are the last resort of medicine because when we administer methods of cures in any illness and they are not effective, then we administer the cautery, and it is effective.
Therefore, it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention of foolish people.
The ancients said that gold cauteries are milder than iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the high nature of its substance;
and they said that the place of cautery does not cause rot, but this is not true, for I have experienced it, and found it to be true in some men;
and gold cauteries are milder than iron, as they said. And yet, when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly;
and if one heats it too much; so they do in the fire; and thus there is enough hindrance.
Or I have ordained this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way may be easier to find.
These cauteries are useful for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two of them used because of a disease called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for the multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all diseases that come from coldness, such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged by a dissolving medicine, purifying the head for three or four nights, according to the strength and age and the patient's ability to endure it. and then, undo the head of the patient.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his lap;
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his two eyes; and leave your two middle fingers there, so that it bleeds from within, then heat the cautery called "olivare," of which here is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and draw it downward, and squeeze your hand little by little, turning it; then lift your hand quickly, and examine the spot if you see the bone protruding slightly; and if you do not see it, then repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterwards take a little salt, and put it in water and soften cotton within, and place it on the spot, and leave it three days;
afterwards put wet cotton in butter; and leave it on until the burning is gone; afterwards treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it cleanses itself; and therefore help it.
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery on until part of the bone is burned, and then one should remove what is burned from the bone, and then it should be treated.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on for so long, and press so hard that one removes a piece of bone as wide as a thimble that women put on their spindles so that the humours may flow out;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time; after that, one should treat and close it.
And these two types of cauteries do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some people where there is a way of fear;
and I think I should leave it;
for the joint is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we testify in other limbs;
and even when the patient's joint is weak by nature, and the first appearance of cautery is safer and milder for me, and with this I use and do in conjunction safety.
When chronic pain affects the entire head and lasts a long time, the patient should use poultices and pills called "cochie," and head washes, oils, and plasters; and if one applies the cautery that we have previously described, and it does not work. Take care if the patient's head is of strong nature and not too cold; Then cauterize below that cautery a little, as we have said above. Afterwards, apply cautery to each horn of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and apply cautery to the place called "vessels"; and that is the place where leeches are applied; and keep your hand so that you do not see down to the bone: The patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of that elsewhere;
And the cauteries of the horns should be finer than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When sudden pain comes in a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed by purifying medicines, and the other cures that I have described in the division of illnesses have been done, and all this does not benefit at all: Then, apply cauteries in two ways, that is to say, with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery with sharp medicine is that you take a piece of garlic, and remove the skin and cut it into two pieces, and then cut the temple where the pain is located in such a way that you can place the garlic piece beneath the skin;
and when it is placed, bind it tightly and leave it like that for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the garlic piece, and leave the wound like that for two or three days; then put on cotton dipped in butter until the wound heals.
After the treatment with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is done in this way. Heat the cautery iron with this shape:
And it is called "close" because the head is made in the shape of a closed enclosure, or a small, slightly curved circle, and a small point in the middle.
and place it over the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron slightly, until half the thickness of the affected area is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery, which is on the outside, does not burn, and that a great deal of blood flows out.
After that, put cotton in salted water, and place it on the area for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare," use the entire point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine, which is not ancient.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have previously discussed in the divisions of diseases, and it does not help, and you see that the previously mentioned cauteries of medicine and iron are not sufficient, then it is necessary for you to heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white;
and thusly apply it to the painful area for a line of half a finger in length, and remove your hand once, and be careful not to cut the artery or penetrate to the bone;
and beware of the jaw that moves when one chews, and the nerve does not consider its movement and that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of a flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting causes great fear, especially for one who does not know about it, and who is not a student and experienced. and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop the blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that these cauteries are not enough for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have said, and cure the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have described in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that and more helpful.
of the pain in the ears due to cold.
When pain in the ear comes from cold, and one has applied dissolving medicines and other cures that we have described in the division, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery that is called "point", of which this is the shape:
Then prick all around the diseased ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the spot. and make ten pricks around each ear;
then treat the spot until it is healed.
of the torment of the mouth
Torment which must be cured by cautery is no more than that caused by phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not use cautery for those that arise from dryness and the spasm of nerves.
When you treat this type of torment caused by phlegm, emetics, and purges of the head and gargles, and this does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the juncture of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and apply it to the head of the ear, slightly below the top of the head, and another to the temple, as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery there until half the heart is burned;
and that is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the scalpel we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle, and the knife should be slightly larger;
after healing the place, as I have said before, until it is healthy.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient has no fever, then make four cauteries: Two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one where the place called "vessels" is, as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, one must give the patient large herbs and pills that purify the brain;
Afterwards, raise the patient's head completely, and place the mustard plaster, as written in the treatise on plasters, on the occiput;
and this is the manner of cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If it is thus healed, it is good; and if it is not, make three cauteries from the middle of the head, going down to the neck, and have one inch of space between each cautery;
and treat it like the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is enduring, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two more on the two horns, and treat it until it is healed;
and let the cauteries be called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of scabs and of what we have said before;
Then, after treating the patient's head, cauterize the middle of the head and on each horn, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
And if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, then apply four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the majority of the heart is burned, and remove your hand; after treating it until it is healed, and let the cauteries, called "olivare", which we have mentioned before, be applied.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cauteries unless they are phlegmatic, and the brain must first be treated with years of other treatments that we have described in the section where the patient is large and suffers from taking medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot bear it, then make them gargle and chew, often cleansing the brain with good foods;
After the physician has placed the head in the middle, he will apply cauteries as we have previously stated, applying cauteries to the vessel and to each horn; And if the patient is strong and able to bear it, then cauteries will be applied as I have said for those who have paralysis and body weakening, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to the method I have described.
If the patient is a child, apply small cauteries in this manner:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or moistures are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize with the same kind of cauteries as we have described for those who have paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are inclined towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain may be cleansed, according to what has been mentioned earlier in the division.
After this, treat the patient's head. Next, make a linen bandage, like a circle, and place it around the head.
and the patient should sit cross-legged, and be well held from all sides.
Then apply the liniment, and use melted butter from a stag's beard. And warm it gently with fire, so that the patient can endure the application. Next, empty the circle inside the head, and allow it to cool.
And do this for the patient each week once, with other good treatments, until he is healthy.
Or if you want to cauterize it by making several punctures with the cautery.
This method of cautery softens the brain equally.
Then put on cotton soaked in butter and goose fat.
of the water of the eyes When water comes first to the eyes by the signs that I have said in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink something that purifies the head, and guard it from all moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times fasting.
After that, he orders him to rest his head, and cauterizes in the middle of the head, and makes two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is in both eyes together, or in one if the descent is in one.
And cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
And watch out for bleeding, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stop it with whatever power you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution how you will stop it;
And sometimes, cautery or a heating instrument is used under the two bones behind.
and if one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then apply the cautery that I mentioned at the beginning of the treatment descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or heating instruments under the two bones; and if more is needed, then cauterize it wisely above the eyebrow with each small cautery.
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help at all, then give the patient three nights' worth of cochies to drink; afterward, elevate the head, and cauterize it in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries of the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery so that you do not cut it.
And this is the shape of the cautery called "clavilis":
When the membrane of the eye is softened by disease and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery which is called "olivare". of which this is the shape:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the membrane is burned, according to the manner I have said.
from hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelids are turned inward and prick the eye, and cauteries are made in two ways: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your safekeeping; afterward, place on the skin of the eyes a figure like the leaf of myrtle, and let the beginning of the sign be beside the hairs;
then put moistened cotton in egg white and plantain pulp over the eye, then heat the cautery whose shape is this:
Afterward cauterize over the figure that you have marked little by little many times, until the heart is seared in that place;
and the signs of the efficacy of the work are that you see the skin drawn back, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it like this for three days, then put moistened cotton in butter until the burning is removed; afterward treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterward the hair grows back, and the skin is softened, then recommence the cautery on that same spot, just as you did first;
and if the hair is burnt away, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The burning medical cautery is that you command the patient to let the hairs grow large and even, then make the shape of a myrtle leaf from parchment;
then take French soap and live charcoal, of each one a third, and grind them together well; and do it quickly, so it does not cool, then spread it over the shape you made, like the myrtle leaf, and place it over the skin of the eyes; and if the patient has only one eye affected, work on that one, and if both, then both; and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white;
and the patient's head should be in your sight and put your index finger on the medicine, and press slightly and move it every time the patient feels the medicine biting, for it bites just like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, then remove the medicine from your finger. And when the biting sensation has passed, lift the area with water, and observe if you see the paper raised as if it had been raised by the force of fire or by incision; and if it is so, then it is good.
If not, then put more medicine back on the area where the medicine hasn't worked, until your work is equal, and your eyes are focused.
Then put soaked cotton in butter until the burned part is healed, afterward treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if you need to, be very careful in your work, so that no medicine gets in your eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterward, and the hairs prick the eye, then restart the medicine on the area that has softened from the paper properly, just as you did before. Afterward, treat until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that human eyes vary in size, and according to this, adjust your constraints.
And the correct path should not be hidden from the one studying this art.
Of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments are not effective, then you must cauterize it according to this method.
Tell the patient to place their head in your lap. and have the attendants hold the patient's head between their hands in such a way that it does not move or shift.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or in parsley juice on the eye.
Then heat the cautery iron, which is such:
and is shaped at the head like the form of a swallow's feather, together with which the cautery is to be held.
If you wish, it may be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it may also be like a tent.
However, this one that is shaped this way is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and remove the pus, and dry it. And if it is closed, then open it and remove the swelling.
Then apply the hot cautery firmly, and hold your hand on the cautery at the part of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not cause harm. And place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you bring the cautery to the bone from the start, that would be good. If not, repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days.
Afterwards, apply soaked cotton in butter, and treat it with desiccated ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, then apply an acrid corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed. and follow according to what he would prescribe in his chapter.
And there is a way of cautery for a fistula that some of the ancients described. Understand the fistula, and clear the area; Afterwards, place in the fissure a subtle cautery whose form is this: and it has the quantity of a [three]-part lead; and hold your hand or cautery firmly, and let the patient not move at all, lest the melted lead run into their eye;
and it is necessary that one place on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water:
The lead will burn the fistula area, and heal it with marvelous soundness.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, it is good. If not, then it is necessary to administer a perforation to the nostril, and return the fistula to the nostril's body according to what is appropriate in its proper place.
Fissures in the lips Very often fissures occur in the lips, which are called "poil," especially in the lips of children.
When you treat these fissures with what we have described in divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly on those fissures until it reaches the bottom;
afterward, cover the area with a plaster until it is healed.
When an abscess comes to the root of the throat or the uvula, or the palate, or to the roots of the teeth, afterward it causes decay and rot and becomes aged and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in divisions, and it does no good: Then it is necessary for you to apply cautery according to the size of the fistula; After the opening or perforation of the fistula, hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the last spot;
and do so once or twice, after the treatment that we have spoken of in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is cured thus, it is good; and if not, you must uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and it is no use, then place the patient's head on your own; afterward, heat the cautery, whose shape will be shown here afterward, in such a way that you place a stick on the tooth;
and quickly place the hot cautery inside, and hold your hand there until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterward, remove your hand and repeat the cautery as you wish;
afterward, the patient should fill his mouth with salt water, and let it soak for an hour and rinse thoroughly.
And in such a manner, the tooth that was moving is thus strengthened, and the softened gums restrained, and the corrupted moisture dried.
of the pain of the teeth
When toothache comes from cold, where there is cold or truly, and the cures of medicine are not effective, then there is need of cautery according to two methods: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter, and put it in the tip of an iron or bronze spoon; Then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and soak it in boiling butter, and put it quickly onto the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools;
and thus do often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a hot iron over it until the fire reaches the end of the tooth.
Cauterization using fire is such that you take an iron or bronze rod, and it should be thick enough that the fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person;
Then heat the cautery, from which the form will come afterwards, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools;
Do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the sick person fill their mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then withdraw it forcefully.
and this is the form of the cautery:
And make cautery of whatever head you want, and according to what you are able to do;
and this is the form of the chain:
of the scrofulas When the scrofulas are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery as described below, and have two openings for the fumes to escape on the other side of the cautery;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it like this for three days; and apply a cotton soaked in butter until the burn is gone;
afterward treat the area with ointments and bandages until it is healed.
When moisture overcomes the channels of the lung, and especially when it comes from a cold constitution, then the patient must first be purged by means of dissolving medicines;
afterward, apply cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go all the way down to the throat, and burn only a little.
After that, apply another cautery to the joint of the neck to the head of the spine, and let the cautery, which is called "clavile," be the shape we have before us;
and treat the area as we have previously said until it is healed.
When the cough and lung ailment are from cold moisture, and the patient does not have fever or dryness, and the ailment is old, then apply two cauteries on the ribs in empty spaces; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cauteries be of the type called "clavile" according to the form previously mentioned.
And if you wish, apply a cautery by pricking, of the type called "poins" whose form is described previously in the treatment of ear ailments;
and let the pricks be up to thirty, or as many as necessary.
After treating the area as previously described, let the cauteries be in three rows according to this form:
And because the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on their back and on their side; Afterwards, lift the heart that is within the tittillite by the two fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated internally, heat the cautery which has two nerves, whose form is this:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces the side, and the form of the cautery would come together with four cauteries;
and for this, a cautery with three nerves is made, so that the form of the cauterization is six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent, and this is the form of the cautery that has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added on top of this, so there are eight cauteries.
After that, put on the cautery for them to be ground with a seal; Afterwards, make the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which thing happens little, then make cautery on the thick part of the cautery's clavile, or many cauteries in pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
When cold and much moisture come into the stomach, such that it is drawn away from its complexion, and the catarrh is multiplied in him, and in the customary ways of treatment, and it does not profit at all, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on his back, and extend his legs and hands. From then on, apply three cauteries, one beneath the breastbone, the size of a finger, along the entire cautery clavile, and two cauteries outside the two sides, so that the shape of the cauteries is in three angles, and have such space between one and the other that they are not joined together when they shed pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach both parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without joining:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape;
and whoever is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and marking on the stomach in that many points according to the quantity you wish; then cauterize with the entire cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When the liver suffers pain from cold and moisture and from great windiness, such that it is forcefully removed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and if the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, then the patient must be examined thoroughly; and apply three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity upon the liver, to dispel the hypochondria, where the rib of the person comes;
and have a space between each cautery the width of a finger; and let the cauteries be of the length of the body, and do not press your hand too hard onto the entire cautery;
and only half of the core should be burned, and the patient should stand upright;
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a knife, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and be careful not to burn all the core, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not reach the boil, for the core is very delicate in that place, and know this to be true.
When he has an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain not too strong;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And when this treatment should be applied to the eyes, the patient must be propped up on his head;
and then apply a compress to the area where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray, of which this is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the heart is burned and reaches the surface, until the ulcer is completely gone;
after the treatment, according to the treatment of wounds, until they are healed;
And it is not appropriate for anyone to use this cautery except those who have studied medicine for a long time, and through whose hands these illnesses have frequently been cured.
Then he may work boldly, and nevertheless it seems to me that it is better to let it alone.
About cautery with a hot iron.
The ancients said that one should make cauteries with the roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: Take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and be as thick and as long as your fingers; and moisten it in oil, and hold it in the fire, and cauterize once between the jawbone and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower in the part under the chin;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backward; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another above the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast, outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly, as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron, resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess; and the pain leaps out, just as we have said regarding the abscess of the liver.
But in this work, there is fear, where the patient dies now, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
of the mice
When you treat the disease of the mice from what we have said regarding the divisions of treatments, and it does not benefit, then there are three kinds of cauteries, all of which are good.
Of which, one way is that you make three or four cauteries, in a line along the length of the mice, according to the shape of the liver cautery that we have previously said;
and do not press your hand too hard on the entire cautery, and let the patient often be on their back;
and another way of cautery is that you heat the cautery that has two nerves, as we showed in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and raise the heart that is near the mice, or where the patient's ribs come towards the left, and let the elevation where you raise the heart be in line with the heart, according to the length of the body, and the cauteries be along the width of the body.
After that, put the two inflamed nerves so that the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the entire cautery on three nerves.
After the cure, when it has thrown off corruption for a long time, and this is worth more than the other cures previously mentioned.
Cautery is not worthwhile for a dropsy patient, except in the manner called "asclytes.
When you treat it according to the methods we have discussed in the divisions, and your treatment doesn't help at all, then you should apply four cauteries around the belly, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back on the spine, and one on the chest. And let the cauteries be close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterward, leave the cautery open to release pus for a long time, and do not abandon the patient's treatment after the cautery. And healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be combined with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the shape we have previously shown. And the one for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what has been previously described.
When the feet are swollen in someone who is hydrops, and are full of yellow water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deep, lest the yellow water should burst out, and let the cautery be according to this shape:
Then make two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the little toe; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without curing, that the water may come out;
after the cure of the other cures that we have said.
When the solution of the belly comes from cold and moisture, so that the virtues of retention and digestion that are in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by any manner of cures; and you see the patient enduring much suffering and of strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been discussed before in cauteries of the stomach, by circular cauterization; and four small cauteries around the navel, a single small cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the groin, and one cautery on each buttock, and two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one, for the cure is profitable when there is good aid.
of the cure of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of thick cold and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in divisions, and it does not profit at all, then make cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, that which is quite outside under the navel little by little in a triangular shape, and one cautery under the navel two fingers.
And if you think the stomach is cold, and the food does not digest, and the face is seen to swell, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen, and one cautery all over the clavicle. And leave the cautery open a long time. After the treatment, leave the place until it is healed.
When you cut the althelul, heat the cautery, which resembles a scraper, and then place it burning on the cut althelul. and leave it [the cautery] so long in your hand that the cautery reaches the source of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much althelul, cauterize each one as we have said; after applying healing ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the alchatim, it will have greater aid.
When the patient cannot endure cutting or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness comes that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula occurs, and is old and throws out rotting and corrupted moisture, you should probe it with a very fine probe, and make sure that you know exactly how deep it extends.
After heating the cautery, which resembles a rasp, and place it into the fistula according to the depth that the probe entered, and repeat the cautery until that rotten and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the amount it needs.
And be careful not to burn the nerves which are nearby, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the bladder and the intestine, be careful of those places, and only make these burns on the fleshy parts, and consider that it does not reach through.
Then treat the place until it is healed, and if the place is sealed, and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the place is completely healed.
And if the matter is not removed, know that the place is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted. And thus, like one of those that we will describe in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from a large windiness, and does not take the form of a woman, then you must cauterize the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery iron we have mentioned before.
And if we cauterize it in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and it will be of greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is weak and softened by cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize on the outer part of the bladder, where the blade's tip begins, one to the right and one to the left, and let each cautery be as long as the breadth of a thumb.
and make one cautery outside the back, or two if you need it.
And let the cauteries be made in the manner previously described.
When the marrow is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the blossoms are corrupted and their ends are delayed; and when they come, great pain is felt: Then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the bladder, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the back outside;
and let the cauteries be pointed, as we have said.
When viscous moisture descends to the socket of the hip, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and if the place of the separation is found empty, you must cauterize the patient on the hip socket with one cautery in the shape of a circle, and mark in front of the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is within the circle;
and let the cautery be like the one used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the others;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain in the hip When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment is not effective, and the illness is old: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of the large foul humors, with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. After that, apply cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two manners: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is according to many manners, of which one is such:
that you cauterize above the socket of the hip three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and wide, and let there be between each cautery the thickness of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
sometimes one does cautery in the middle above the head of the hip, so there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, then cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip;
but make it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the thick parts of the hip are burned.
And this is the manner in which one does it in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or the leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and leg, then make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, slightly to the left side;
and let the cauteries be incisive, and let the thick parts of the hip be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toe or near the heel, cauterize it in three or four places where he feels the pain with the cautery called "points". And if necessary, then make more.
And if you know the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a cautery with an incisive or circular cautery, and take good care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient more harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen several who have made cauteries on the ankle of the foot, and they left it on so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot too, and the entire foot was pierced and corrupted. After a solution of the belly from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make cauteries on one and the other, according to this method.
And the wise ones said concerning the cautery of the hip, of which this is the method, make one such iron and let it be at the head as large as a fingertip, or a little less, and let it be with indentations and from one indentation to the other the space of a finger's breadth;
and let the indentations be opposite on two sides, and let them be like knots, and let there be one handle of iron well made;
and this is the shape:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then it is placed on the affected hip, and turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize once, and leave it three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasim says that we rarely use this cautery because of fear of its effects, and we see few who use it;
and nevertheless it is a good cautery, for those who can endure it, and the place where it is applied.
The cauteries of burning medicine are such that you make an instrument with crossbars, on which the handle of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron, with one long side, and in height there should be two notches, and between each there should be the thickness of a finger; and they should be open at the front and top, and join together according to this shape:
Then place the box of the hip on the patient lying on their healthy side, and gently place your hand over the hip box; then pour between the two circles of hot water, which should be heated in a fire for a short time, and let it sit for an hour, and let the patient endure the heat and burning.
For it finds there a burning sensation like fire;
and when the burning is gone, remove your hand with the instrument and remove the hip from the soft water, and leave it for three days, and apply butter until the black part from the scald is removed; and leave it three days for the pus to drain;
and that would be the final aid after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or the leg, you make an instrument that soaks with water, according to what you did to the hip;
and that is the way of hot water, and I have written it in the treatment of the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole to escape so that the point of a razor can enter;
where there is a small hole to escape so that the point of a razor can enter; and place over that pot another pot well-sealed, and put on alkali and lime and sweet water above, so that there is a thumb-width above the powders when you have it well grasped in your hand;
and let it stand thus until water drips down into the sealed pot, then take all that water and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong and is administered in the manner of medical works and in cauterizations of other limbs.
For it does great work like fire, and there are other medicines with which to cauterize well the hip, such as treacle and honey, and anacard and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure with which a man was cured of pain in his hip and sciatic nerve, and he praises it greatly, and says that no other cure was done, and that he was healed in one time when this cure was performed, and he had bathed as he teaches afterwards.
And says in such a manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it finely with a little fat, and apply it to the hip, thigh, and leg where the pain is, and bind it.
and leave it for three hours, and by the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then put him in a bath until his body is slightly wet, and put him in bed, and the pain will depart entirely and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it helps much.
and the cauteries should be done in such a manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow that is between the big toe and the other one, which is called the foscile.
Then take dry goat's dung, and hold it in the fire until it is embers, and place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do this again, and do not cease doing this until you think by feeling that it has reached the hip, and that the pain has ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "cautery of the goat".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether through falling or striking or excessive evacuation, or by the appearance of spreading cold matter, cauteries are of no use for any of these appearances, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
After the patient has been purged of foul pills or similar things, one should make, on the back, where the pain lies, three lines marked out, and in each line five cauteries, or more, according to the strength and the quantity the patient can endure;
and let the cauteries be made according to the cautery called "points";
and if you wish, make three or four cauteries at the middle claviform cautery according to this shape:
This illness often comes to young children, and the signs of its beginning are that they have a tight chest when they rise, and fear; and you find in the back's lower spine and on other spines the appearance that comes after.
When you see this and wish to treat it, cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this shape. So that the cautery encompasses each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a cautery that punctures two or three lines, and let the punctures be close together.
After treating the area until it is healed according to what we have said, be careful not to apply cautery to any swelling that is close to a nerve.
Of the pain of the joints.
When joint pain is caused by moisture spread throughout the body's limbs, and when pain comes in the feet, which the physicians properly call "gout," and when it is from a cold cause and the cures of medicine cannot heal it, then it is cured by cauteries in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary to prick on the sole of the foot, make a cautery at the entire cautery called "point. And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, make three or four cauteries on each knee, of each part, with the entire cautery olive-shaped;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand on it longer than the depth of the heart has been burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and back, administer the cautery that we have described in this chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make pricks around the wrist two lines;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, make pricks on each joint and on the skin of the hand;
and if the pains come to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and provide good care to the patient and give them medicine.
For if you give him good care and purge phlegm, he will be healthy with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the boil descends to the testicles, and it is new, then when you wish to treat it, he should not eat anything that day. and that he use things that loosen the stomach, so that the waste descends from his belly;
After that, make him sit on his back between your hands, and tell him to hold his breath until the boils are healed, and bring them to your fingers, and sign an incision below the rupture on the bone of the knuckle, and make a mark that is similar to half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:
until it is white and it throws sparks. Then bring the bowels back to their place; and let the minister hold his hand over it so that they do not return back;
and properly support the patient's thighs, and place a cushion under him and a servant on the thighs, and another on his chest who holds his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with all your hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, you should begin again another time until you come to the bone; and carefully watch that the bowel does not jump when you perform the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that by this the patient does not die, or other evils.
And know that when you do not come to the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cauteries of children be subtle according to their size, and of large people also large according to their size;
after three days treat the place of the cautery with butter until the burn is removed;
after that treat with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well healed;
and it is necessary that his nourishments be light for a long time, so that the bowels do not rumble when he starts to walk about the rooms.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and keep it on for forty more days;
and let him have good rest, let him work little and guard against too much drinking and eating, and against excessive noise-making;
and when he follows this instruction, he is completely healed.
And I will speak next about the treatment of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they do not grow any more, apply cautery cauterization according to its extent, and let the third part of the core be burned. after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said one should cauterize it with a three-angled cautery according to this shape:
but first mark the spot and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside it, and hold your hand in the middle so the entire cautery is held tight.
But the first cauteries are lighter and gentler.
of old pain in any limb When pain comes to any limb, either from falling or striking, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is of no use, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points," and the cautery should be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and weakness and virtue and location of twists and its pain.
If it is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, repeat another cautery on that one, for such is the custom that it must be changed to the limb that is closest to it, wherefore you must perform the cauteries until the patient is healed.
The sick are sometimes helped by cautery, and especially those who are ill from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it to be cauterized, be careful if the illness is in its beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and it does not recede nor remain, and you fear that the corruption will seize the entire patient, then do five cauteries on the head: One in the middle of the head, and another towards the forehead at the end of the hair; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and leave your hand there until the cauteries reach the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize the mice according to what is before.
And if the disease is spread everywhere; and if it is obviously spreading, you must cauterize it with these cauteries, as we have said, on the head, and one cautery on the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the buttocks and another next to it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the chest, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the back, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one cauterizes on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give him, and the more benefit it will be.
And know that the patient feels no pain at the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you find in the types of irons.
After the treatment, apply the place with flour of wheat with honey and other treatments until it is healthy.
When inflammation comes to any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then you apply cauteries to the limb according to its size and smallness.
And let the cauteries be a little penetrating into the thickness of the flesh. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes cauteries are applied to the hand and foot and back, at the point of the nerve that is making the limb stiff, and thus the inflammation is removed.
And nevertheless, no one should intervene unless they are knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease called "albaras" has grown old, and the tools of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the thickness of the core, until the whiteness is gone and its color changes.
then treat it with flour from vetch and lentils, with rose oil and plantain leaves, and blood from a colon and blood from an almond, one part of each. and mix them all together, and bind it with a cloth, and let it air in the place until it is healed.
the treatment of a sore by cautery
When a sore first appears, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that seems like a circle, all around the sore.
And nevertheless, the wise say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the sore;
and nevertheless, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen it happen a few times;
and a more correct thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circle," as we have said in the matter of cauteries.
When someone has a disease called "adubelati," and it is slow to heal, either because of the superfluity it causes or because of the age of the sick person, when they are decrepit (that is to say, too old) and they have little blood, or because of the time; and you wish to hasten its healing: then cauterize it around with many small cauteries by pricking; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to heal.
And if you wish to pierce it with the entire cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And place your hand in the middle of that ailment called "adubelati" until the cauteries have pierced the core, and let the cauteries be such that the patient feels them from outside in such a manner that the course of the corruption is relieved.
Afterwards treat it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of ailment called "corrodens", which is nothing other than a gnawing of the limb, for it eats away the limbs like fire eats dry wood.
If you see this ailment in a place that can tolerate cautery combined with fire, then heat the cauteries small and large, according to what is necessary for the location where the ailment is.
After cauterizing from all sides until you eradicate all corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that everything that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply soft poultices with oil to the cauterized areas until the heat from the fire is gone, and all corruption.
After the treatment with ointments that generate flesh.
And if after three days you see that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on those areas that have remained corrupted.
And this ailment has sometimes been cured with a sharp medicine in place of fire cautery;
However, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the treatment of sharp medicine in the division: Take it when you need it.
of the sores that come to the feet Often, a disease called "clos" in our understanding, arises on the feet from outside, and is a large, painful swelling that injures the foot.
And the cauteries for this disease are according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery iron, just like a pointed shaft, and it should be made of good iron, sized so that it can encircle the wound from all sides, and have fine edges;
Then, put it hot onto the wound, and turn your hand around the wound until it reaches the bottom of the wound; and leave it like that for three days until it starts to fester; Then, make a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the wound will fall out and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with healing ointment until it is healed.
And if they are corrupted on the body's surface, and this happens many times on hands and feet, you must apply hot water cautery; and is of this kind: Take a copper or iron rod, or a pointed stick, and apply it to the nail and the wart, that is to say for warts; and place the rod so that it covers the entire area, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the rod reaches the base of the nail, and the hot water can find a deep path to the base;
and let the patient endure a little the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like that, and it will detach from all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you remove all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from cold nerves, or from quartan fever or other, you must make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery;
This will stop the trembling, and the health will quickly recover from the cold illness.
Sometimes, foul-smelling pustules appear on the body, caused by large corrupted matter.
Therefore, as soon as they appear, one should apply cautery to each head of the pustule. A subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose point is heated in fire, or of long aristoloch root, or a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, according to this method, and they cannot grow further, but the excess from which they come is broken, and they are healed.
But it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times there are great bleedings from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from the outside, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and similar things; and it is a very grievous thing to stop.
And yet, when this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and hold it firmly until the blood is stilled beneath your finger, and no more drips out;
then put the olive cauteries, several small and large ones, into the fire until they are completely red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it leaps out again when you remove your finger from the vein, and the cauteries have gone out, quickly take another one of the cauteries which are in the fire.
And do not cease to do this, one after the other, until the blood is stopped;
and be careful that you do not burn the nerve nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be well stopped, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have stated: or by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by tightly tying with thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stop blood; and let it be bound and constricted.
Whoever tries to stop the bleeding by tightly binding cloths or placing burning things on it, or other similar things, will not benefit much.
And if this happens to someone and they do not have a remedy or medicine present, they should place their index finger on the wound of the vein, as we have said, and press firmly until it is stopped above the wound and above the vein; and do not move the finger, but moisten it with cold water frequently, let it be very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and make inquiries beforehand about the cauteries and medicines needed.
We have told you in the first chapter all the illnesses in which fire cautery, or burning medicine, is required, and their causes and origins, and the instruments and forms of cauteries;
and I have arranged that chapter from head to foot, and I will proceed through this chapter in the same way so that one can more easily find what one wants.
And before I begin this, my dear son, you must understand that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first of cauteries, and therefore more caution is necessary.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I advise you not to undertake folly. For many kinds of people come for treatment. so come those who become so angry with their illness that they die easily because of the frenzy they find in their illness, and from the great severity of their ailment; and of these one should be afraid.
And of these there are those who give you their sense, and say: wait, I am healed"; and the illness is spiteful.
You should not consent to those who come to you with this manner, but put more emphasis on your honor than your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely concerning that of which you are certain, and of which you can take and gain praise.
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your patients so that health may be achieved;
and this will help you acquire good renown, and glory, and a memory of praise.
My dearest son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and uprightness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter, following the chapters that came before, or the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may more readily find what you need.
Know that this illness often comes to children during childbirth, and when the midwife holds the child's head too tightly;
and sometimes it comes from an unknown cause.
And I have never seen this illness outside of children, and in all those I have seen, death was rapid; and therefore, it seems to me that it is best to leave such treatments alone.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled each day until it could no longer be supported;
and the moisture increased so much that he died, and this moisture gathers beneath the bone on the surface, between the heart and the bone;
and the treatment is such if the moisture is between the heart and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you should make a wide incision in the head;
and it should be as long as two fingers, until the moisture runs out;
and see here the form of the spatumile:
If the moisture is more spread out, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs show the seams of the head opening on each side, and the pus spurts out when you press your hand inward, and this does not stop: then it is necessary to make three incisions through the head in this manner:
And after the incision, remove all the moisture outward. Afterward, bind the incisions with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil on it, and leave it like that until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with bandages and ointments, and let the head heal evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you look at the size of the abscess and the accumulation of pus;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Then cut there where the abscess is open, and the filling of water, and cut it according to what you are able to do;
and be careful that you do not cut the artery; and if blood flows, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When a disease called "catarrh" occurs in someone's eyes or chest, and the illness is long-standing, and the medicinal cures are not effective, then the final cure is cautery, with which one will cut the two arteries.
It is necessary, then, when you are about to cut them, that the patient tilt their head back. After that, they rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient strains their neck with the entire cloth. Then look where the veins branch, and the places of one and the other are near the ears, and little are connected.
Then mark the places to cut, then cut one and the other with a sharp scalpel from two sides, until the incision reaches the bone, and it is that wide as the head.
And if you wish, place the scalpel under the artery and cut above it, cutting as you should through.
And when the vein is cut, the blood jumps up continuously outwards.
And if the artery does not appear when feeling, you must measure the amount of three fingers, then mark and cut until the bone.
and what is necessary to draw out of the blood is six fingers, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can endure, and the fullness of the artery.
then examine the wound: if it remains on the bone, slightly rough, cut it so that inflamed abscesses do not come, then compress the wound and bandage, and treat with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine comes, and acute catarrh, due to moisture in the tears and heat in the temples and old-fashioned madness and similar things, and he is treated with various medical cures and none of this helps him, then we should lance the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the way to extract them is that the patient should pull back the hair on his temples and locate the artery that appears in the temple, for it is clearly visible by its pulsation, and is rarely absent except in some men who are too cold;
and if it is present, the patient tightens its neck with some cloths, then rubs the area with a rough cloth, and irrigates the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula, of which this is the shape: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it upwards with pincers, and separate it well from the tissues that are beneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, then turn it with the point of the uncine, then cut it in that part according to the quantity of the two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood will not completely stop flowing.
And draw out blood from the sixth part, down to the third;
and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no putrefaction comes before the healing of the wound, and there is no leakage of blood;
then cut the excess that is between the two ties at that same moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery to the bone until the heads are cut;
and this is the best work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a hot complexion. For cauteries are a help to finish the moistures: Therefore, it is of greater help for moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and place on top well-made tents;
and when one releases them, they should be treated with dry medicines that make flesh grow, and with bandages, until they are healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you are working on it, then hurry to cauterize it, or fill the place with vitriol and hold it with your hand to stop the bleeding; and if you do not have that available, place your finger over the spot until the blood is congealed, and irrigate the area with cold water until the bleeding stops, and hold it as is appropriate;
And there should be a finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the burning iron upon it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two edges because it is not completely fused by this cautery.
and this is the form of the cautery:
And the method that is gentler and more light in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery from two sides, but the sharp parts should be thick to maintain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes are flowing down the veins that are on the top of the head, and no medical treatment is of any use, and you see the patient's forehead reddening, and feel trembling or vibration on the forehead; and if the eyes are swollen and moist, so that the hairs on the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are scorched and burned by the heat of the tears, then this treatment is needed. And the ancients called it "contusion cure", and you should do this to the patient with this ailment: remove the hairs from their forehead, then make three equal cuts across the forehead along its length;
And the ancients called it "contusion cure", and you should do this to the patient with this ailment: remove the hairs from their forehead, then make three equal cuts across the forehead along its length; and one of the cuts should be in the middle of the forehead, going down towards the nose, and the other two along the sides, above the eyelids, and be careful not to cut the arteries that are on the sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jawbones, and make each incision three finger-widths long;
and have ready a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe the blood, then take a sharp spatula of two parts, of which this is the shape:
from the incision near the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two incisions across the entire surface above the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then pull out this spatula. then place in the first incision the instrument called "cultellaire," which is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is blunt, not sharp, and this is the shape:
And place the cutting edge towards the flesh next to the heart, and the blunt edge towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous down to what is visible of the heart, and then do the same in the middle incision to the other incision;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the area for the drawn blood;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and place on it cloths soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard against inflamed abscesses forming there;
and on the third day, untie the bandage, and apply a large quantity of warm water, then treat with basil ointment with rose oil, and other treatments used for healing wounds, until it is healed.
When some people experience acute catarrh frequently, and you see their eyes tight and small, and their sight weakened, and their eyelids burning; and the hair falls out, and a sharp pain is in the head, and the patient sneezes; Then know by these symptoms that these materials and this catarrh come from many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And you must instruct the patient to lie on their back, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another one a width of the fingernail. And begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move with eating;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two edges of the incision and place old cotton and linen bandages there; then bind over it cloths soaked in wine and oil, and guard against a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with things that dry up and make flesh grow.
In such a manner: take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow everywhere.
of the stopping of the ears
All that falls into the ears is one of the four things: or grains, or beast, or a stone from a mine, or similar things, such as iron; or seeds, such as chickpeas, beans, peas; or flowing things, such as water and snot, and similar things.
When a stone or other thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear, nor grow within the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then drop a small amount of violet oil or linseed oil, and then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with spices, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upward.
Often, pus comes out through this treatment;
and if it does not come out, then administer extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it bursts out with the forceps, that is good;
If not, then administer extraction with a fine, small double-edged hook;
and if it does not burst out with that, make a copper wire and thrust the end of the wire into the ear opening forcefully, and seal what is around the wire with soft wax so that air cannot get in with the wire; then pull it out forcefully, for very often it bursts out as we have said;
and if it does not burst out in such a way, take glue of the kind used to catch birds, and place upon it a suitable instrument to do this, and place a little cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull forcefully.
And if it does not burst out through all these things that we have said, then hurry to lance the ear before a hot abscess comes to it, and spasm;
and the method of the lancing is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to its measure, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn their ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear at the fat or dependent place; and let the incision be like a crescent, until you come to the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and suck it hastily into your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is within and it swells, then administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin, subtle spatula according to this form: and administer an incision of that grain.
But do not do this at all when you think that the grain is moist due to the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it;
then extract with delicate tweezers and suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is light.
In the water, then, which falls into the ear, it is necessary that the patient use a preliminary sneezing action, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let them lie on the same ear where the water is. If it dries up through this, it is good.
If not, then take many stones according to the length of your finger, thin and light, and heat them a little in the fire; and let the patient place one or several in the hole of their ear, and jump up on their feet on the other side, and place another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not cease to do this with stone on stone until the water is completely dry, and thus it dries completely;
And if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and the other end hold over the fire until the softest part of the reed is burned;
then repeat this with other reeds until the water comes out completely, as we have said about the stone.
In the extraction of a creature, if it is small, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, administer extraction with tweezers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of embedded worms in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment is of no use, then you must examine the ear in the sunlight: if any worms appear, extract them with fine tweezers, and if none appear, take the cautery that has this shape:
And it should be narrow below and wide above. And place the narrowest end into the ear according to the severity of the patient's suffering, then suck strongly on the entire cautery; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey to come out, then plug around the cautery with cotton as I said for the stone;
and if they do not jump out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have tested in the killing of worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and medicines into the ear with this entire instrument, of which this is the shape as you see: And it is of silver or copper narrow underneath with little holes, and open above for distilling;
and to press in the distillation with a well-made copper instrument for this, and if you wish, take a scraper and wrap around the tip of it with cotton; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever you want of your medicines into the tube, and the tube be in the ear;
then put the scraper with all the cotton inside, and press your hand gently until the oil has been distilled into the ear; and the patient smells it inside, and let the distillation be a little heated by the fire so that it is distilled into the ear; and watch that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be very good.
of the stopping of the ears
No children are born who do not have any holes in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men through the stopping of a wound, or of flesh born inside the ear, and these blockages sometimes go deep into the ear, so that one cannot see them;
and sometimes there is a little pus to be driven from the hole, and one sees it well.
That which goes deep, so that one cannot see it, is of serious healing in many conditions, and in that which one sees, you must place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the blockage apparent, then remove all this pus, of which this is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting at the front and back, smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
If the blockage is of flesh born on or around the ear, hold it with delicate tweezers, and cut it lightly, until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep within the ear, take a delicate, thin scraper, and warm it slightly over the fire, then place it within the ear canal.
If you feel a blockage, of which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce it gently, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
Then place a tent within the ear, according to the width of the opening, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it with rose water, and sprinkle powdered ground vitriol upon it;
And if you see the ear swollen, you should remove the tent and replace it with another tent moistened in a cerote made from rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; Then treat it until it is healed.
And if blood discharge comes, dip a sponge and cloths in cold water and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop blood discharge, which are in the treatment of distillations.
This ailment, which comes to the papers of the eyes when they are moist and dry, you should stretch them with tongs and pincers, and cut with a spatula at their roots; Then put powdered vitriol on the spot.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a subtle lens cautery, and after the incision, the cautery is worth more.
and many times they return, when something remains from their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of hail Many times there come from the eyes stones that appear like hail in shape and hardness, and for this reason, this disease is called "grandine," and is a collection of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below. The work is such:
The work is such: Watch if the grandine moves from side to side, and it is an easy thing to know.
Then, slice it broadly, then lightly scrape each part, then take it with tweezers and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without slightly piercing the eyelid, do not harm the patient.
And if the fissure is large, assemble it with stitches and cure it until it is healed.
And if it is small, do not apply any force, for the ointments will restore it quickly and generate flesh.
And if the stone is descending into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, turn the eyelid over, and extract the stone with tweezers, and cut it and press it on either side;
And if the eyelid is separated by the incision, this will not cause any harm.
And when the stone is cut, wash the eye with salty water, and treat the area with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
Of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a grease that is generated in tissues of the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to adults, and it greatly hurts their eyes, and they experience catarrh in the mornings, and cannot look at the light of the sun because tears rush to their eyes;
And because of this, they often lie on their faces and sleep on their sides, and their eyelids below their eyebrows are wet, as the swelling and appearance are covered by the exinach that is visible in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the method of treatment is that the patient places their head on your chest;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the quantity of exirnach in each part, then place it over it; and press with your fingers on both sides so that the exinach is gathered within the circle;
then cut a slit in the middle of the moisture at the spatumile, a slit no wider than the wound made when opening a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exirnach; and in several locations exirnach comes out of the slit, according to the shape of a piece of white fat.
Then pull it out completely, using a piece of cloth as a shield between your fingers, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is spread out;
and be careful not to push into the slit, lest you reach the entire spatumile to the eye and injure it.
And if the exirnach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, then slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
then pull it out as we have said, then moisten cloths in oil and water, and place on the area, and bind with bandages.
And there are such men who grind seaweed and apply it to corrupt the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess forms in the area, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of hairs of the papules When hairs grow on the eyelids, in addition to the natural ones, and they grow old, they harm the eyes, causing various ailments such as customary tears and softenings of the eyelids and albuginea, to the point that it is the cause of the destruction of the eyes.
and the cure is according to four ways: or by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is before in the chapter of cautery, and it is done either by incision and stitching or by cauterization, according to what I will say.
You must place the patient's head on your lap, then turn the eyelid of the eye into your left hand.
If it is turned, it is good. If not, then put a needle along the whole thread above it. and let it be next to the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and pull the thread upward along the entire eyelid, and turn it to the scraper.
then cut in the part below the eyelid, beneath the attached hairs, all the way along the cut, from the large tear duct to the small one;
then remove the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and linen under the eyelid, then apply a figure of a shield to the eyelid, like a myrtle leaf, and yet it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you want to raise the eyelid that is divided into all.
And if there is a case where a large quantity of the eyelid is to be cut according to the eyelid's softening;
then cut along the entire space above the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the cuts be close to the natural hairs, the thickness of a root, then insert the forceps into one of the two angles of the wound, then scrape it all off;
then bring together the two edges with a stitch of a needle and a fine thread of wool, and wipe away the blood, and dry the excess threads on the two eyebrows with any sticky substance, if you wish to do so;
and if not, then do not treat it further, and leave the stitch and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitches with drying and constricting substances, for the paper renews the joining of the wound and its assembly, but the stitch is weakening (as the ancients said), and this is a work without fear; and if there is another way:
and if there is another way: and it is that you shape the paper into a figure like the myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three separate incisions according to the form that is here:
then cut what is above with small equal forces, according to the form that is here:
And if you lack the power to hold the pliers, and the thing is not equal, then take a needle with one thread and place it in the middle of the figure; and put another thread next to the large tear, and the second thread next to the small one, and bring the threads together between your fingers equally;
then lift your hand equally, and lift all the skin on which you have marked, as we have described, then bring the two edges of the wound together with stitches, and cure it until it is healed;
and if an abscess arises from your incision, soothe it with cerotes and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs on the paper are converted:
if so, you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitches in one and the other are more artificial.
The treatment of the canes is thus according to this form: and is that you convert the paper and the slit within according to what I have said, and then make two canes by art, and two subtle ligatures as long as the paper and the width of the spatula are; and cut as two ends from two sides where you hold the threads;
then assemble one and the other subtly over that which stands out from the paper of the eye, and bind the two canes from the two parts tightly; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin which will be bound will die and dry and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with a force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, and the paper is removed, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
the work is such that you take a fine needle, and thread a fine and soft silk thread into it; then assemble the ends and tie them together subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the chase another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then place the patient's head on your lap;
and let it be beside the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then put the needle with all the thread into the root of the hair next to it, and pierce the paper quickly until you pull it over the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the thread, and put that hair into the thread, if there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand so that the hairs come out with all the thread in the paper with the natural hair.
And if the thread is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then you will pull the thread down along all the thread that you have prepared, until the thread comes out of the hole above and you see it through the vision of the eye;
Then you will pull out the thread and the needle, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair heals in its place and the flesh grows over;
And if the hair is small, then attach one long hair from the natural hair, and let it grow with that or leave it until it is elongated and then remove it.
of the corruption of the eye When this disease, which is called "aleacrati" or the corruption comes to the eye, there are two types of it:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it arises from the wounding of a cut or from cautery, and from similar things.
And the method of treatment is that you should split that scab, and separate its edges, and place linen dressings inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and you should not use things that dry and constrict in its treatment. For if you do that, the illness will return worse than before;
but use softening things, like fenugreek; and water or cooked linseed and pounded diachylon ointment in any oil, and wrap a dressing in it, and treat it with this.
And the key to your treatment is to ensure that it does not heal in the same shape as before;
and these methods we have described are only ways to address this illness, so that it will not return in the same form as before.
This illness, which is truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental.
The accident comes from wounds and cuts and cauteries and similar things;
and the method of treatment for this is that you take a needle, with which there is double thread, and pierce it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out in two places on the flesh;
Then stretch the flesh over the entire needle and cut it with a spatula wide. And if the shape of the paper returns as it should, that is good;
If not, take a scraper and place it in the fissure, and turn the paper, and make two fissures on the inside edge of the paper;
and let the edges of the two fissures be at the two angles of the incision you have made, and let them form an angle such that when they are assembled, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "a Greek I";
Then remove that flesh, according to the amount its edges are sharpened below, of that which surrounded the paper, then join the two severed parts and stitch them with a wool thread;
Then treat it with the medicines we have described, softening and poultices, until it is healed.
And if the ailment comes from a fissure, or a suture, or cautery, you must make a fissure completely beneath the hairs of the papers, and according to what is stated above; Then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said;
Then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said; And one must perform the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and wise masters devise remedies with all their power so as to restore the shape to its natural form;
And the patient himself, according to what work and instruments are needed in various dispositions.
When this joining occurs in such a way that the paper above is glued together with the white of the eye and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the tip of a razor under the paper and lift it up;
and extend it with tweezers, so that you cut what is airy and subtle, not too sharp or too sharp, so that the patient cannot endure that the too sharp spatula injure the eye;
and make your incision, with which you scorch that assembly, lightly, so that the paper returns to its natural form;
and the entire assembly is healed, and sometimes they make it sore in the eye with salty water, and lift it with fresh water, and with colander;
then place a linen tent between the paper and the eye, and place wet wool on the eye, abundant in egg-white; and after the third day, use the colander and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two types: It is nervous and similar to hard surface, and another which is not nervous, but is like frozen white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and attempts to pick at the punctures, one cannot.
And both types begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover the entire vision and all light and movement of the eye.
And the method of the incision is that the patient should put their head in your lap, then open their eyes; and lift the paper in your hand, then pick the nail with small tweezers, and extend it upward; then take a needle, and put a horse hair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle slightly and insert it into the nail, and pierce it with the entire needle, and tie the nail with a thread and stretch it upward, and shave all the hair from the side of the nail that touched the eyelid and silk to the hair to the root, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a very fine spatula and with small forces, and leave the natural flesh or tear duct, so that the course of tears is not accustomed by the incision;
and sometimes the nail is stretched with a hook only, and with a thread, as we have said; then scrape it with a very soft spatula, in this manner:
And be careful that the spatula does not touch and break the fleshy tissue, and that the eyelid is not pierced;
and after the incision, drop a little bruised sil and lead-based ointment into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not very sensitive, and you cannot push the needle in, and the lancet cannot enter, often this kind of nail is cured with medicines;
and grow as I have told in the division, and if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye and take a small, sharp spatula according to this shape: And carefully trim the nail, and if you see that it is getting thinner and the blood is close, then distil from your mouth into the eye an ointment made of lead, red ointment, and bruised sil, and plug the eye until the next day;
If something opposes you in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first cure the hot abscess until it is healed, then recommence the treatment as before, until it is healed.
then repeat the other treatment according to this same method, until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the tear duct flesh is harming the eye greatly, then suspend it with the forceps, and cut off a part of it, not all of it, so that the tear ducts do not be harmed.
Then distil red ointment made of lead into the eye.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows, covering the pupil and pressing on the eyelids, turning outwards, and resembling a pomegranate blossom;
and the procedure is that the patient places his head in your hand, then opens his eyes, and you pick up all that flesh with suitable forceps, and hold it firmly.
Then cut the first flesh, and continue cutting with a razor until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye in the process.
And the incision should be like the one we described for cutting nails, and with slight force, as if removing a scab, as the shape after this chapter demonstrates.
And when the incision is complete and all the flesh has been removed, apply to the eye oil of crushed frankincense or red-colored distillates and similar corrosive medicines, and place a piece of cotton on the eyelid with a bandage of egg white, so that any hot abscesses are secured.
And if anything remains, and the blood is thick and you suspect a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess.
Then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do with any flesh that is added to the eye in this manner.
However, you must lighten the treatment for each weak eye according to its natural constitution. and from its accidental condition, in the work of iron.
and do not put your hand in any of these works until you see that the limb is suffering that work.
Those are red veins that cover the eye, and hinder its work and weaken the eye every day.
It is necessary first to examine if the eye, in which the stain is, is strong, and there is no other illness besides the stain. then treat it in this manner:
instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, then carefully pull the veins with tweezers according to their knowledge, and let the tweezers be thin and double following this shape:
And let two tweezers be in degrees in one body following this shape:
then, using tweezers, carefully pull the veins and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see the veins move away from the eye;
and be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and perform this work at midday in front of the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you only cut the veins;
and when you have done this, then distill green and red bile into the eye to corrupt what remains of the blood.
And if you cannot collect everything at that time, then make a plaster on the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for several days until the pain is relieved and is assured of a hot abscess, then recommence according to this manner that is before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the tweezers:
The mirror is called "arissati" fistula:
when you treat it with cautery and with burning sharp medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, then there is a way to cut open the abscess, where it should remain, and remove all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it with all the instruments of which this is the form;
and it is called "rough head," and be made of iron, at the head rounded, and be pointed like a file, as it is in the present form:
And place it on the spot of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
if the place is healed, and flesh grows, and the body of the swelling is healed, and it remains so for 40 days, and it does not renew and is not inflamed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other remedy than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron and sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, then take a drill according to this form, and let the iron point have three angles, and the shaft be tapered to the tip as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the entire drill until it pierces the bone, and the patient feels it because air comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and hardens the place, the matter goes to the nose; then it is a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are fully open and there is no disturbance in the nose, nor any lessening, then you must bind the patient;
then cure it, then put leeches or cupping glasses without striking to draw, then place on the eye a ligature made of asafoetida and aloe and frankincense and sarcocol, and then hold the eye and put a plaster over it with bandages and cloths;
and the way of the cloths is that you take cloths soft enough, and double each into four, and then put one over the other according to the quantity the eye needs;
then hold it tightly over a hard bandage, and again apply leeches to draw without striking;
then remove the leeches and leave the eye held tight day and night, and if the ligature softens, you must hold it tight;
then remove the ligature after the day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, that is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster, bandages, ligature, and leeches until it is healed.
from tearing of the cloth or with When disruptions come in the cloth or with, then appears, and comes forth from the papers like the grain of resins, and is frightful to see;
Then if you see it cut, the work is such that you put a needle into the root of the part below up to the one above, then put another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and make it pierce, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the cloth around it, and tighten it well, then pull out the needle and put on the oiled wool soaked in abundance of egg;
and leave it until the thread breaks with the cloth, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is restrained by the cloth on each side of a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great evidence, pierce it with a very thin spatula which goes deep into the eye, and drain the white moisture and lower the eye, and immediately enter again;
then draw it out until it is healed.
This illness, called "alcunnati," is nothing more than a swelling collected in the eye, resembling a descending boil, and it is not actually a boil;
and the method of treatment is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands from two sides, and move it so that you see the swelling come up towards your eyes; then it should be fixed, and not descend, and the light should be cleared, and the patient should see things as he used to;
and if it does not descend from below, know that it is a boil, and if the swelling's descent is not as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a fine spatula and cut on the cornea a little bit along the conjunctiva's continuation with the cornea and the crown, so that the swelling comes out;
and when it is out, then distill into the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water or fenugreek boiled and honey, then be treated with another treatment until it is healed.
of the eye's waters We have already described the types of boils in the division, and what is necessary to pierce them; so work according to the health.
You must have the ill person sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and cover the healthy eye and hold it very tight;
then put the paper from the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the tip of the instrument beside the crown by the thickness of a finger in the white of the eye at the part of the lower tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" forcefully, and turn your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and the measure of the almagda's path should be at the depth of the space between the pupil and the end of the dark part; and that is the crown of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that paper through the clarity of the cornea, and then place the instrument to the place where the point is, then press it along one path after another.
if the point descends now, the patient sees in front of him the instrument in his eye.
After a short rest, if the point ascends the second path, apply force with the instrument, and when it is deeply embedded and no longer ascends, gently extract the almagda by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little of the gem-salt onto the point, and lift it out of the eye. Then apply over the eye bandages or wool soaked in rose oil and plenty of egg, and bind with a healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, apply a common poultice with plenty of egg.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have eyes that are too hard, you must take the instrument called "alberit," of which this is the shape:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then insert the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work, prepare a suitable bed for the patient, where he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and be deprived of all movement, and let him eat light foods, and do not move his head either to the right or to the left, and be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in the same dark room, and test his vision, and show him some things, and then replace the bandage until the seventh day;
and you should not do this during the treatment hour or immediately after the incision, but you should delay this, because the inflammation rises quickly.
if a hot abscess comes, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and apply what soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the vision and put a bandage on his face to cover it for a few days, and let him stay in the same dark room.
And then slowly leave the house, and return to his own affairs;
and know that no apprentice should intervene in this case. And one came to us from Yrach, who told us that in his country, they made an almagda (a device) for piercing, with which they draw out water, but nevertheless, I have never seen one in our land, nor have I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the appearances of the shapes of the almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and are properly of bronze: And let their heads be of this same fineness, and the rear end in three sharp angles.
Sometimes there grow on the nose various added flesh, of which some appear like scorpions with many legs;
and there are some in which there is deeply embedded flesh of a dark color, and there is soft flesh of a good color. In that one of these flesh that is soft, and not embedded, you must make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
In that one of these flesh that is soft, and not embedded, you must make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and apply the lancet to that flesh, and draw it out; then cut what you can hold with the sharp, thin lancet on one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, then open it with any of the thin instruments gently, so that nothing is left. and if without tormenting, or the abscess bursts, then support it as is appropriate;
and if it is a malignant abscess, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then apply vinegar or wine there easily and gently. If the wound opens, and moisture comes out to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, know that there is new flesh on the bone above, to which the instruments do not properly reach for cutting:
Then you should put in a linen thread somewhat thick, and be knotted by hand, and have a space of one or less between each knot; and let the patient hold the thread's end in their mouth as best they can, and pull it while smelling it, until it comes out of the wound into the mouth;
and many times children do this in school, and it is an easy thing for whoever wishes to do it;
then hold the end that comes out of the wound in one hand, and the other end that comes out of the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other, holding the knots of the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have corrupted the flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back into the wound as before;
do this for three days or more, until the ointment has eaten away all the remaining flesh;
and then put a lead strip on the wound for several days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for cleansing the head, with which one distills oils and medicines into the wound:
And it should be of silver or bronze, resembling an open lamp, like a small tube, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full to cleanse the head;
and have a handle on the head to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh over the wound
Many times a sickness called "telul" arises at the head of the wound, and grows and becomes large often, until it is a visible thing to look at;
and therefore you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it completely, then put the cautery or burning medicine on the spot;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, beware if it is hard, of a dark color, of poor feeling:
if you do not touch it with iron, for it is a festering abscess, for when one cuts it sometimes, great harm comes to the sick person;
and if the abscess is of soft touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be entirely cut open, empty the sick person and cut it without fear, and treat the spot with dry and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity comes to one of these cartilaginous works, it profits little, except in some men.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, look to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then bring the two edges together with a stitch, and then treat it until it is healed;
and if the edges are already separated on one side and the other, you must cauterize all the parts of their core until they bleed, then bring the two edges together with a stitch, and hold it tight, and powder it over with powdered dragon's blood and crushed frankincense; and put a piece of strong plaster or other joining plaster over the powders, and leave it until it dries by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the stitch is that you bring together the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the stitching of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of abscesses of the lips
Hard abscesses occur in the lips of men, resembling grains of millet, sometimes smaller, sometimes larger;
Then you should turn back the lips, and cut open each one, and pick it up with pincers and cut it in each part;
then fill the space after the incision with ground vitriol, until the bleeding is stopped;
and then bandage it, and treat the area with dry things until it is healed.
Many times flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus";
If so, you must hold it with pliers, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow out;
then put powdered vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders, on the area;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this happens many times, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: if it does not return after the cautery;
Sometimes there are gatherings at the root of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scabs that are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellowish and wormy, so that the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth are stinking;
so you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the teeth or scabs where they appear, until nothing remains; and thus do with the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other blemishes, until they are cleaned;
and if one removes what is there at the first attempt, that is good; if not, then repeat again on the second day and the third, until you have scraped it all;
and know that teeth need various tools for scraping, according to what the craftsman shows, because the scrapers used to scrape the teeth have different shapes than those used to scrape between the teeth; and these shapes and others be with you prepared.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay the extraction as much as you can, for this should not be done hastily; for it is a very important substance until there is no longer any excuse for scraping.
Then, when the patient is forced to extract, you must be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they think it's in the healthy tooth, and they have the good tooth pulled out; and yet the pain does not depart because of this, until the bad tooth is extracted, for we have already wanted to do this to these lords;
And when you are certain of the aching tooth, you must cauterize around the tooth thoroughly with a strong cautery to protect the gums on all sides;
Then, using your fingers or delicate pliers, move it in small, gentle steps until it is properly loosened, then firmly grip the pliers; and let the patient's head be in your holy place between your knees, and hold it firmly so that it does not move.
After that, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out easily, then take one of these instruments and gently push it in from each side, and move it as you did previously.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with cloth where the holes are; and gently hold it with pliers, so that it does not break when you hold it;
and one must work very skillfully around the gums to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, leaving a part of it, and returning to the patient with the malice of the root causing greater pain than the first.
And beware that you do not do as the ignorant masters do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the jaw, and do not achieve what we have described;
but sometimes cause great illness by the remaining roots, or by the jaw they break, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is drawn, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the place with ground vitriol;
and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, with which one first moves the teeth, should have long points and large handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And they should have large members so that they do not bend when pulling, and should be of well-made, strong iron, and be toothed to hold the tooth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains when pulling, you must place moistened cotton in butter for one or two days, until the area is softened, then put the pliers, called "algefri", on it, whose head resembles a bird's beak.
And let the teeth be made like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with all these pliers, you must uncover the flesh all around the root, and place the instrument called "althali", that is to say, a pick, of which this is the shape:
And it should be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root jumps out with this, it is good.
If not, use all the instruments, whose shapes will come after:
And if one uses this instrument with two prongs, of which this is the shape: and other instruments that are in front of the teeth, and of this instrument that looks like large pliers, of which this is the form:
And let these instruments be strong so that they cannot break, and know that there are many instruments for teeth. and also other instruments, which are not counted.
and the wise and subtle master finds his instrument by himself, according to what his work and the patient show him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of others; and if one breaks a bone or other bones, or whatever it may be, he searches for the instruments that are necessary, which I have told you, and aids himself with gestures, of which this is the form:
And they should be large and strong enough to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but that it can be held and removed.
and then restore the place with suitable medicines, and if there is decay in the bone, and it is small, remove it with this instrument.
When the teeth appear not according to the natural body form, and the shape is ugly, especially in young women, you must know if the tooth grew after another tooth and is not in the right place, and cannot be smoothed or filed:
Then remove it. And if it is loose with the tooth, take this instrument, which has the shape of a small beak, and is made of sharp, pointed iron:
And cut it little by little over several days, due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that you don't move the other teeth.  And if it seems it can be filed, file it with a file like this one:
and is like the file used to make needles.
and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it does not move as it chips off.
Then, finally, plane it with a rasp, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, it is necessary to file away the sharpness until it is smooth, so that it does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
When the front teeth are loose, whether from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bear down on what they eat without them falling out, and you have treated them with binding medicines, and that doesn't work;
then they must be restrained with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes.
and let the thread be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and put it doubled between two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you come skillfully to the healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the covering until the point where you began, and gently and skillfully tighten your hand until it does not move;
and let your ligature be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them together, and place them between the healthy tooth, and put it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it as tight as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
If it remains, it will serve thus for the entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the way to straighten the two healthy teeth and the two other ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, it is put back in its place, fresh every time, as we have said;
and no one should intervene who is not skilled and patient, and sometimes a tooth-shaped piece of cow bone is made, and it is placed where the defect is, and it is tightened as we have said, and remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament, which comes from under the tongue by nature, is born like this; or through an accident of a closed wound;
and the treatment is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold their head in your grasp, and lift their tongue;
then cut the large nerve ligament, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or a knot, and it is from the closure of a wound, then insert the hook and cut the ligament broadly;
and be careful that the cut is not too deep, for the artery that is underneath;
and when you have done this, lift the place with rose water and linen, or with cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue;
and the patient should attend to it each night, so that the wound cannot heal.
And if bleeding occurs, then put powdered vitriol on the area; and if the blood does not stop, cauterize it with a lentiginous cautery, which is good for that; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed,
and if you see it of a different color, or black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is a cancer;
and if it is inclined to blennorrhea, and there is moisture, then one should insert a lancet, and cut it with a thin spatula, and release it from one side and the other; and if the blood stops during your work, apply crushed vitriol until it is stanched, then return to your work until you have extracted all the fluid;
then elevate the area with pillows and bandages, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of abscesses of the throat Sometimes boils appear in the throat, called "godath," also known as the two almonds.  When you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, be cautious:
if they are hard abscesses of small size and dark color, do not touch them with iron.
And if they are red and the root is large, do not touch them with iron, also to prevent bleeding; but leave them until they are ripe, and then you will lancet them, or they will break open on their own;
and if they are white and the root is slender, prepare the instrument to cut, but first see if the abscess is warm and settled.
Then make the patient sit facing the sun, and place his head in your grasp, and open the mouth and let the surgeon take the tongue in his hands, and press the tongue down on all the instrument, which is of this form;
and be of silver or thin copper, like a small knife:
When you press the tongue down on this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the lancet and place it in the sore, and pull it sharply upwards as far as you can;
and pull out any matter from the sores with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the shape, resembling a wedge; and yet the heads are curved, and one towards the other, and are very sharp, and are made from tempered iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument present, then cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: And be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, then cut the other according to the same manner, and after the incision, the patient gargles with hot, sharp, and mild water, and if a discharge of blood occurs, the patient gargles with water, or with cooked pomegranate peels, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the blood is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two almonds, so cut them thus just like the two almonds equally.
And I treated a woman for an abscess that had arisen within her throat, namely a small abscess;
and it had nearly closed the entire throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and she would have died if she remained like that for one or two days.
And the abscess had swollen so much that it had forced two veins through the two nostrils.
I quickly took action then, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out, and drew out a large portion of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue;
after inserting the lancet into the abscesses, and cut out a part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage in the woman's throat was cleared, and she now began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to cut the abscess for a long time;
and the abscess would repeatedly grow back, and fill the space I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I incised and cauterized it within her throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did to her after I left.
of the eye
When phlegm descends to the eye, and it is swollen and elongated, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is below, thick and round, it is called "eye".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment is of no avail, and you see that the inflamed abscess is calmed, and it is thin, then you should cut it.
and the one that is round, gathered, and not elongated; and if it is bloody or of dusky colour or black, you should avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner I have described, by its whiteness and length, you must have the patient sit in the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have previously spoken; then place the hook in the uvula, and pull it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you should not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, it harms the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said about the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of the cutting, you should use a device for the cauterization of the sense of fear.
And the manner of the cautery is sharp, sharp. And have the patient put their head in your safekeeping, and then press the tongue to the instrument that we have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with a sharp, hot cautery, so that it is neither too thick nor too clear; and apply the end of this instrument, of which here is the form:
And have a hollow head where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with all the medicine on the wound;
and have the patient lying on their side, so that the saliva and mucus run from their mouth into the medicine inside, so that it does not go down the throat and harm the wound;
then hold your hand over all the medicine and press it against the wound, for the amount of half an hour, until you see it has healed and the burning from the medicine has subsided;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around an instrument, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton on the wound, so that the cotton adheres to the wound;
and do this often, until the cautery is complete, then leave it to dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to repeat the cautery with the medicine, repeat it, and after the cautery, wipe around the wound with cotton soaked in butter, and clean whatever is around the medicine.
and rinse with cold water, and treat with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer from incision than cautery.
If it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and yarrow and similar herbs, and combine them all or some of them in a pot, and add oil, and boil it.
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot let there be an instrument shaped in this way: And let it be of silver or bronze, and let one of the ends be put into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the eye through the canal, until the eye is deadened;
Then repeat often, until the eye dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the arrival of a hot abscess, because many things happen there; and do not do this [treatment] except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a tube and put a piece of egg shell inside, so that the patient's mouth is not too hot; For the egg shell does not allow the vapor to burn the mouth, and this is a good cure overall.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or something else, gets stuck in the throat;
So you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue with the instrument toward the sun so that you can see the object move;
And that which you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; Perhaps the lodged object will come out with vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navelwort, or a piece of lettuce root, or a dry piece of bread; and ties a thread to the sponge, and then swallows it; and when it reaches the place, it will harden, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument in this shape:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest the cough come upon it, nor push the bone inside;
and it is better for the patient to push the instrument, so that they know where the thing is firm; if it pushes down, or they pull it out with the whole instrument equally, until it is out.
Of the leech of the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when this does not help at all, then look into the throat of the sick person in the sun, after you press their tongue with the instrument I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine pliers that are suitable for this.
And if this does not work, take a braided cord, and put it into the throat of the sick person, then put a hot iron on the end of the cord, and do this often. And if the sick person is feverish all day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open their mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with their hand often; and as soon as the leech senses the water, it will fall off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the sick person with asafoetida, using the instrument I described in the fumigation of the eye;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the manner of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are glowing embers, and let the bottom be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and through that hole should be the head of the instrument;
then you throw your fumigant into it, and the sick person places the head of the cane in their mouth, and closes the mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but goes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall now, and if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salty and harsh things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcibly by this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls the leech, is, when one can see it, like curved pliers to enter the throat; and it should resemble a bird's beak, and have a rough file-like surface, so that whatever it grasps, it cannot let go;
Many are the types of abscesses, according to what remembrance comes here after one and another in this book, and they differ in their perforation and size;
and it is in two ways, one of which is in its own resemblance, and of what it holds of moisture.
And the second way is for the places where they are in the body.
for the abscesses of the head are different from those of the foundation, and the abscesses of the fleshy area are different from those that come to the joints, and each has its own judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that one should not pierce until the boil is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that should be pierced when they are swollen, and do not ripen according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near joints.
For when an abscess comes near the joints, and one leaves it until it is rotten around, perhaps the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Where the abscess is near the principal limb, and if you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal limb;
or if it is near the foundation, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a swollen abscess without complete digestion, except for one near the foundation, lest it rot deeply, and become prolonged inside, and a fistula result; and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for the perforation of the ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is calmed, and the fever subsides, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and of the throbbing and the sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and you should make the perforation in the most dependent place of the abscess, and where it appears moved;
and let the perforation be along the body's length, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all such places equally where there is no membrane. In those that bend, according to that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to delay the perforation until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the poison will extend from it, and it is full of much filth. and perhaps harden the lips and the depth of it.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And you must administer small abscesses, small openings; and in large abscesses, large openings, and many fissures according to the appearance of the size of the abscess;
and if there are such abscesses where it is necessary to cut the core, and to cut; when it has become as hard as a flap, and is numb, it is necessary to do as one does with boils:
and some are split into three angles, and some are cut like myrtle leaves, like abscesses of the ingrown nails;
and some where a round incision is made, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those that have no head, like a soft superficial abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and when the abscess is large, and it has collected a great amount of pus, and you pierce it, you should not remove all the pus at that time, but remove only a part; then seal the abscess until the next day, then remove some more of it again; do this repeatedly, gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or small children, or elderly decrepit men. For the spirits sometimes jump with the release of the pus, so that the patient may die unexpectedly, and you are unaware of it.
Therefore, approach this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, then dry the wound, and check if the wound from the abscess is small; and if it is a gaping wound, then apply linen or old cotton dressings; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, then you must place a dressing in each one so that they meet each other;
and if you have cut into the abscess a portion of skin, and you have removed it, then you must fill it with old cotton or linen rags, without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs during your work, apply cold water and linen, and wet the linen, and place it repeatedly over the bleeding area.
And if the bleeding persists, apply remedies and treatments, and the powders I have mentioned in this book, and if it is during winter, and the area where the abscess is is very sensitive, then you must place dressings and cloths moistened with wine and warm oil;
and if it is in summer, and the area is fleshy, then you must place dressings moistened with water and oil, or wine and cool oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then drain the abscess, and dry it and treat it as necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in the treatments of abscesses:
or I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
Where the head's skin has small abscesses, and there are types of them that are in layers, like the yolk of an egg, and there are many similar ones.
Some are fatty and some have moisture like pus;
and some are hard and stony when cut, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the incision is that you test with every instrument called "probe," of which the form comes next, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then it is pierced above along its length.
And when the moisture is emptied, then it is scorched without leaving the skin which contains that moisture, for it returns often when one leaves anything;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in vinegar and salt, and fill the wound, and leave it until the next day; and those that ran will run away from what is left over from the night.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that it does not remain overnight;
then treat the wound with ointment suitable to it, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains a lot of fat, cut it along this shape, lengthwise; and put your incisions in it, and scrape it from all sides, and apply all your treatment to draw out the matter where it lies;
and if the artery resists you, do as I have told you afterwards.
And likewise do for a stony abscess, and regarding its cutting and treatment as I have told you.
And if you cut into a stony and moist abscess, it is easier, because they contain little blood. And if there are any of these abscesses, in the head where there is no moisture, and these were the abscesses that I cut in the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, and white stone, and it could not be broken; and if one had struck it, one would have made as much of a wound as from a stone.
In other abscesses appearing on the head, except those which appear on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be in the most dependent place, to allow the pus to drain;
and treat them as is appropriate.
Many times these abscesses appear on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they appear elsewhere on the body, and are numerous, and intertwined with one another.
And each scrofulous swelling is properly within its own area, like the swelling and abscesses of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that will not obey health.
In those, then, which you see to be well-disposed upon touching, and are similar in color to the body, and are mobile on all sides, and are not connected to the nerves of the neck, nor to the artery, nor to the duct, and are not deep;
if it is appropriate, you should cut it above, and scrape each part, and stretch the two lips of the wound with forceps, if you need them, as we have said regarding abscesses of the head;
and drain it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and that the instrument is not sharp or cutting, so that the hand does not slip, and does not go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or artery, and this prevents you from working, then place powdered vitriol in the wound, or some powders that stop blood, and constrict the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened and begins to fester.
And when the blood is stopped, then return to your work until you complete it;
Then look with your index finger if any small scabs remain, and cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the base of the scab, you should not cut the scab at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread and let it fall off gently, without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then dress it.
And if you cut the entire scab, you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch them now, since there is no excess remaining due to the size of the scab. If necessary, you must cut the root of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said.
If necessary, you must cut the root of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said. Those scabs which hold excess, pierce them where they appear ripe.
and pierce it as the one previously mentioned, depending on it, then apply bandages with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption. And when the wound is well cleansed, treat it with ointment that promotes flesh growth, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the constriction of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and that is the record of their words.
For those with quinsy, it is necessary that the fissure in the throat, called the "epiglottis," be healed; and that no help be given by these, because all the veins and the phlegm of the sick person are affected when they have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat or in the two tonsils.
When the sickness is in the channel of the phlegm, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the destruction that comes from the strangulation.
It is necessary, then, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, that we cut it below three or four small transverse cuts between the two circles or by the amount of the cut on the surface, not in the cartilage;
and those places are suitable for the section of the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far away.
And if the master is afraid, then he must stretch the skin of the throat to the entire inside, then cut through it until he comes to the channel; and drain the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut through the surface, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm from the channel which jumps out through the broken place, and by the lack of voice;
and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed during which strangulation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound in the heart, and stitch it all together without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasim says that one should not do this until the throat is completely closed, and the patient is judged to be dying, and the breath fails him. Then they cut the epiglottis so that the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus he is saved from death;
and for this, the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness had passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they commanded to stitch the wound and heal it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife and stuck it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the windpipe;
and I was called to treat her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had flowed from it, and saw clearly that she had not cut any vein or conduit except the throat, and the breath was escaping through the wound.
I hurried and closed the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and the only result for the young lady was that she was hoarse of voice, and afterward returned to her condition;
Therefore, I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there should be no fear.
This abscess is called "goiter," and is a large abscess the color of a jaundice, and is very common in women;
and is according to two manners: natural, and accidental;
where natural has no device.
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which one is similar to fat in us, and the other manner is similar to an abscess that comes from us from an artery; and if there is fear, and it is not appropriate to use strong force except in that which is small, and prove and search throughout the entire intruding part: if you find it like fat, and it doesn't connect to any vein, cut it, just as one cuts fat, and pull it out with all its covering if there is any. and thoroughly search everything, and treat it as is appropriate, until it is perfectly healed.
Many kinds of fat there are, of which I will tell all the likenesses;
and it is necessary that I tell all the difference that is between fat and issue.
I say that issue is hot and feverish, as long as the boiling is past, and the putrefaction is completed; Then the fever and the heat cease.
With fat, there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains the synovia, which is its own sac, and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a wisp and becomes large;
and they are according to two appearances, either fat or moist, and many in color are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of fat, that you first try and inquire into the entire instrument called "entromissoire," according to what its form will be in the following chapter.
And the manner of inquiry into the abscesses of fat is that you take the most moist place you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, since this should be according to the size of the abscess;
Then remove the instrument, and take care that nothing leaps out.
If moisture runs quickly, whatever color it has, then cut it as I have said of the other abscesses;
and if, after the instrument, no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, then cut it in a cross shape, and take it with tweezers, and gently scrape it from each side and watch the skin where it lies so that you can pull it out healthy with the fat;
and if you cannot pull it out healthy, then pull it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the pus will return many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood troubles you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and put soothing things over a hot abscess, and cure it with other cures until it is healed;
and if the pus is large, then suture the two edges of the wound, and cure it with those that generate flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary to you or otherwise, hurry and fill the place with pulverized vitriol, and leave it for two or three days, so that the wound putrefies, and the ebullition of blood ceases; then return to cauterize what has remained of the pus.
See here the forms of the instruments for incisions, and they are of three kinds: large and medium and small;
and of them there are three squares called "albaret," and one called "breb," and of them there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, for seeking out the abscesses of fistulas;
and are also like the needles with which one sews the sores, and are of brass, or iron, or silver, and those that are yellow are better, and are more experienced with black lead for searching for the crevices of fistulas;
and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the probes are of many appearances, as you see here:
and some probes have two bends of three kinds also;
and some probes have three bends, and are also of three kinds;
and some probes have two bends, and probes of one bend only, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The head of these which one sharpens are cutting, and some of them do not cut much more than on one side, so that one scrapes the flesh, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these instruments are the probes fitted into handles, so that the sick person does not perceive them in the opening of the abscesses;
and are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them mostly in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in sores, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, resembling the bark of hazelnuts, according to this shape, with which one stops blood; and one places it sometimes on the place that is bleeding from cuts of veins, and arteries, and sometimes again according to this large shape:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to become corrupted, so that they seem like women's breasts;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must do so according to this shape from this line .b. up to .g.: then scrape off the fat, and fill the wound with a healing medicine, then stitch together the two edges of the wound, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops down and is softened because of its size, as happens with women, then cut it into two sections on top, by two similar incisions; so that one is attached to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this shape, from this line .b. up to the line .g.; then scrape the skin between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, and what is necessary for the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not fully made, because the patient does not want to rest, or due to the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining tissue and fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come from under the armpits are a kind of hard scrofulous swelling, where there are ribs, and some of them contain moisture.
Those that contain moisture must be cut according to this shape, from line .b. to line .g.: And when all the pus in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is like a scrofulous swelling, lance it as we have said in the treatment of scrofulous swellings, and if the wound returns pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin is sutured over it, there often follows an abscess, and the same happens to a swollen vein and an abscess.
and if one recognizes it as being due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightening.
and when it is due to the vein, swelling and redness are apparent.
And it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is beneath the armpits, and in the groin and at the neck and in many other places, and is very large. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid iron treatment, and the one that is at the head should be avoided as well, and in the one that is swollen with an artery that penetrates the skin deeply;
then make an incision with a lancet, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is exposed;
then insert a needle beneath it, and pierce it through to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then prick the area between the two ligatures with a probe until the blood contained within it flows out, and the abscess is released;
then administer the cure that causes swelling, until the ligature falls off; then treat it with the appropriate ointment, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is due to the incision of the vein, then you should grasp with your hand what you can of the abscess from all the skin, then insert the needle beneath the area you hold in your hand, and pierce it, and place a double thread there, so that you draw it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, or tie it with the thread from one of the two sides to the two ends of the thread;
and if you fear that the thread will not hold, then reinsert another needle throughout the thread beneath the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess until the superfluities come out, then cut the superfluity from the core and leave what is tied;
then place a damp cloth soaked in wine and oil, then administer treatments of poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come to the artery and vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are injured, or by excessive labor, and similar things.
And this happens more often to the shoulders and hands and in all places where there are joints, and it is a grievous abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in several dispositions without pain;
and when it is squeezed tightly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep within the body, but under the skin;
and it moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or underneath or above, and that which is in joints should not be cut with an iron. perhaps contraction would ensue; and that which is on the head or forehead, lance the skin with a lancet.
and that which is on the head or forehead, lance the skin with a lancet. If the abscess is small, hold it with pincers and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the belly and nowhere else, a disease called "fungus" because of its resemblance to mushrooms, and its root is subtle, and the head large;
and there are small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly that resembled fungi more than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had fine roots, and were slightly split, and moisture often ran from them.
I cut them and found eighteen ounces in one, and six in the other, and the work in the incision is that you look to see if the patient is moist, and the color of the fungus is white and moist and has fine roots; if you cut it with a broad spatula, and have the cautery iron heated in your presence.
if you cut it with a broad spatula, and have the cautery iron heated in your presence. For in cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overwhelms you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and afraid of the iron's incision, then take a well-made lead thread and bind the fungus as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the fungus, and it breaks away without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is a fear of cutting the belly itself, but you can certainly cut half of it, then cauterize it so it does not return;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the tiny part that is of a dusky color and poor feeling and milky appearance.
For this is a deeply rooted abscess, and I will come to the treatment of sores later.
when the wound is open If the wound appears from cautery, a cut, or a break in the surface, and is on the belly, and some pus comes out, as happens in other breaks, or of blood flowing from veins or arteries, as is mentioned before, or of wind;
and if it is from a break in the surface and through the escape of pus, the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a slight thing without pain, and open with various exits. And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when pressed with the fingers, it recoils and then returns, and perhaps it is sealed, and grows greatly at the entrance of the bath and due to hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a slight thing, and appears well when you press it with your hand, nor does it constrain it.
And if it is due to blood, the abscess appears large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity. And if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to the blood of the artery, or of the vein, or wind.
And if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to the blood of the artery, or of the vein, or wind. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I have told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowels, you must instruct the patient to hold their breath and lie stretched out straight, then draw lines all around the affected area. then command him to lie often between your hands, then go around the area you marked with a whole spatula, then stretch the upper half of the abscess with the large cupping-instrument. then tie it around with a strong thread, or a strong silk cord firmly, and let the edges of the wound be free.
then open the stretched half of the abscess over the bandage, and place your index finger into it, and search for the intestine. if you find it trapped by the bandage, release it, and push the intestine back out of the belly.
and if you find the bowel, take it with the cupping-instrument, and cut away the excess.
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then go around carefully, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads into them, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross shape so that you pierce it.
then constrict the abscess in four places around the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh will fall away by itself. or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and close the abscess as we have said.
or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and close the abscess as we have said. and drain the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place with what is necessary, and sew up the place.
about the chancre We have discussed the varieties of chancre, and how one should treat it with medicines, and how one should avoid using iron in treatment.
And we say that a chancre arises in the flesh, and great caution is needed in its treatment. The ancients said that when a chancre is in a place where one can scrape it off, like a chancre on the breasts and in the thigh, and similar places, one should remove it entirely when it is in the beginning stages.
No one has ever healed one before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you should purge the patient of black bile on occasion.
Then, if there is a clear fullness, you should cause the patient to bleed, then prepare the patient a good place to do the work.
Then remove your dressings or sores, and the hair from all sides, and remove the bone from all sides without leaving anything.
and let the blood flow freely, and wipe the area well with your hand or something else, and if the bleeding makes you worry about cutting an artery or vein, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. then treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already discussed the various forms of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, the signs of each form, and the treatment using medicine and iron.
and one should not use iron in these two forms: that is to say, tympanites and hyposarche, for it is a deadly thing;
Therefore, when treating this form of dropsy, called "sunstroke," with medicine, and the treatment is ineffective, observe if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as diarrhea and similar conditions; if not, do not use iron, for there is danger;
and if you see a patient with strong vitality, and they have no other illness but dropsy alone, and they are neither too young nor too old, you should then proceed in this way: Lift the patient upright onto your hands, and the attendant should press on the abdomen, pushing the fluid towards the lowest part of the chest, then take the pointed spatula according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so sharp that it can reach the intestines when inserted, and cannot injure them;
then check if the dropsy is lodged toward the intestines: if it is, you must cut above the bulge three straight incisions below the knife; and if the dropsy is from the disease of the liver, then your incision should be to the left of the bulge three inches;
and if it is from the spleen, it should be on the right, and it is not appropriate for the patient to lie on the incision so that the superfluities do not flow to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and apply it, and lift your hand to the whole space between the skin and the surface just as when skinning, to the quantity of a fingernail or a bit more;
then pierce the surface until the space comes to the empty place, and that is the place of the water, then pull it out forcefully, and apply this instrument of which this is the form: And it is similar to a thin silver chain, and is of bronze or light iron, and has a small hole on the lower part; and on the side of one part, three holes; and two on the other part, and one on the other;
and the head is cut like a feather, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribe cuts the feather:
at the top of the head is the alemele, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately descends upon the instrument;
then empty it by half or a third, for if you empty it more than necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the resolution of his spirit from the wound, or he will fall unconscious, or he will approach death;
but empty it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's virtue signify, and his pulses;
then pull out the instrument and retain the water, and it is now retained by the heart that stops the aperture that is on the surface, of which I have spoken, which you pierce in this manner;
then resume the instrument the other day, if you see the patient suffering this, and draw a small quantity of water;
Do this every day, and be careful not to empty it completely, until only a little water remains.
And if you doubt about the patient, and you leave a lot of water, then cure him with a hot grave or sand, and through much sweating or a bath and the sun, and let him drink; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healthy, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the water extraction, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
If it is necessary, immediately pierce it with a very thin needle according to this shape:
then place a fine lead plug in the opening, and bind it and keep it like this for three or four days. When he wants to urinate, remove the plug, and let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps this is not necessary, for the urine that comes forth will not leave it closed.
Those whose opening is small, shall be treated with a lead plug, as we have said, and it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in their proper place are wounded, for some are born with the opening at the top of the penis, so that they cannot urinate unless they raise their penis. and cannot ejaculate because the fluid cannot reach the bladder, and that is a serious illness.
And the method of the treatment is that the patient lies often on his back, then extends the head of the penis and cuts it as if the size of a feather, so that the opening falls into the middle, as is necessary;
and beware of bleeding that often occurs, and if it happens, staunch it with what stanches blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Abscesses of the penis Often these ulcers appear on the penis, and it is an ugly appearance of flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
if it is necessary, you should take them with a fine probe, and cut and clean them all, then put moistened cotton on an Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the ulcer is malignant, with a foul color and odor, you should apply cautery to it.
When you have cut it, and if the ulcer is under the shaft, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, you must remove the part of the ulcer that is inside first; and when it is closed, treat the part outside.
For when you treat it together, the shaft of the penis is not sufficiently secure that it will not be pierced, and blackening and corruption occur in the shaft of the penis and in the testicles;
You should remove all that is black and corrupted, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate bark and chickpeas, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cauteries help two dispositions together: that is to say, to the discharge of blood, and to corruption;
And if the head of the penis is corrupted and retracted, you should place a lead pipe in the penis and the patient should urinate through it;
And when the skin around the head of the penis is inflamed, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens due to a wound or an abscess, then you should cauterize it with a pointed instrument until the membrane is broken, and the head of the penis is fully freed;
And if it is a difficult thing to do this, you should cauterize a small part of the head of the penis and the skin with a cauterizing iron;
Then gently separate them, and place a thin, damp linen cloth on it, so that it does not become inflamed again.
Circumcision is not a simple separation like other wounds; However, when we perform this operation willingly, and especially on children, it is necessary that we do the best and least painful work possible.
I say that the ancients did not practice circumcision on their children, as they do not use it in their law, and we only know what we have learned through experience.
For I have seen most of the masters and surgeons who performed circumcision with a knife, and with force, and with a whole new blade;
so the heart recoiled, for there are two layers, and perhaps one was cut through while the other remained. Or it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and the cleansing of the foreskin does not ensure the tip of the member is safe.
and in cleaning the nail, perhaps the iron slips and the work is ruined, and many times it heals without needing cleaning, and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing that is done with force throughout the entire thread, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for force cuts precisely both above and below.
For when you press your hand, it cuts evenly in one whole instant. but let the thread be tightly wound around the skin;
and the manner of the first work should be such that you make the child, if it understands, think you are only tying the thread around the rod, and then you can make it joyful in all the ways you can.
then hold it straight between your hands, and position the forces between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand on the rod and blow on the heart, and pull it up until the head of the rod is inside. then clean it well of the dirt that has accumulated, then bind the marked place with a double thread, then bind it under one loop to the other.
then clean it well of the dirt that has accumulated, then bind the marked place with a double thread, then bind it under one loop to the other. and hold it with your two fingers by the second loop at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two loops, then quickly lift the heart and pull the head of the rod. then let the blood flow drop by drop, for that is the cure. and put powder on it, and on top of the powder a thin layer of a mixture of a hard-boiled egg white diluted with rose water, mixed with good fresh rose oil, and leave it until the next day, and treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
The form of the forces for cleansing is this:
the two edges should be taut and sharp, and the edges should also be as wide as the handle.
The error of the cleansing is when the heart within flees from the incision.
Then you must stretch it with your fingernail, before the area develops an abscess.
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with pliers, and then cut it.
And if it passes three days, and that which is under the rod is swollen, leave it until the hot abscess has subsided, and lightly scrape it.
Cut it as you can, and be careful of the part of the rod, it will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with the healing powders, as we have described in the section on powders, and if the cut goes too deep and it goes upward, it will not hurt.
Then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the retention of urine
The retention of urine is caused by a blockage of stones, or congealed blood, or pus, or dead flesh, or similar things, which we have discussed in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see the retention is due to a stone lodged in the bladder neck or opening, then the patient should be bent over their knees. And their feet should be placed on their back, and the patient should stretch their belly away from their back, and the patient should restrain their breathing as much as possible. And then the neck of the bladder is forced to express the stone above, so that the urine is released.
And if it does not come out, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction using the instrument called a "syringe", of which this is the form:
And it should be made of fine, light silver, like the feather of a bird. And its length should be a palm and a half, and it should be slender at the tip.
And the method of releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe.
and cut the excess wool and push it to the tip of the syringe, then grease the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a seat, and lubricate the bladder and penis with moist oil, olive oil, and warm water;
then gently place the syringe on the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then double the penis over towards the groin;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and let the patient feel it reaching the void, and this is not done in this manner, except because the passage it travels through is twisted;
then stretch the thread all the way through the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out, and make the urine run;
and repeat the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and let the patient be lightened.
When sores or blood come into the bladder, or putrefaction is gathered there, and you wish to distill there acids and medicines, then do so with the whole instrument called "clepsydra", and this is the form:
It is closed, and has three holes: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the places through which the medicine flows should be such that it stops well the urethra without adding anything, so that one can draw out the moisture, and push in when necessary;
and when you wish to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the tip of the instrument into the moisture, and pull in the pulling that is inside;
you will draw the moisture into the instrument, and then forcefully push the pulling inside; so the moisture will enter inside, and will now reach the bladder, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysters the bladder:
And it is of silver or of archaut, and the head is higher;
and beneath a sinew where the sinew falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put the moisture with which you wish to clyster the bladder into it, then tie it between the two breasts with a double good thread, and heat the moisture a little bit over the fire;
then put the head of the clyster into the verge, then press your hand on the bladder all the moisture coming in, until the patient feels that this moisture has just entered the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle of it, and pierce it roundly around; then put a strong thread into these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a die, and put within it what you wish of oil and moisture and water, and tie it in the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.
of the stone
We have already spoken in the division about the types of stone, and extraction together with medicines;
and have discussed the difference between the stone lodged in the kidneys, and all the signs, and which stone one should work on with a chisel; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that the stone lodged in the bladder happens more often to children, and this is a sign that the urine leaks from the bladder, resembling water in its subtlety;
and it appears as gravel, and the patient scratches his penis, and it bends many times, and then stiffens; and many of these leaks damage the foundation;
and the healing is easy in children until they are four years old, and is very difficult in old people, and is moderate in young adults, those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those with small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the filth that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and lift and move them downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes rises from its high place.
Then have him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards;
then seek and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut above the stone.
And if it does not fall upon touching at all, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if the patient is a grown young man; and place it in its base, and seek the stone, and when you feel it on your finger, then bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press on your finger, and bring it to the place you want to cut.
And command the attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and tell him to extend his right hand upwards to the nipples, and with his left hand remove the skin beneath the nipples in the area where the incision is to be made;
then place the scalpel, the shape of which is this: And cut between the area between the nipples and the fundament, not in the middle but on the side of the left groin;
and be straight over the stone, and your fingers be continually on the fundament, and the incision should be transverse, so that it is wide at the top, and narrow at the bottom, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure from the fingers on the fundament will cause it to jump out without difficulty;
and know that there are stones where there are angles and edges: if it is difficult to remove;
and some are hidden, similar to a ball, and round, from which the removal is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not come out, you should use pliers that are like a file on the end, to squeeze the stone so it does not escape; or you put under it a subtle curved instrument at the end;
and if you cannot extract it thus, enlarge the opening a little, and if the blood flows, cauterize it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, put the largest first in the bladder's neck, then cut above, then pull it out forcefully, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are more.
And if it is very large, it must be softened, and a larger wound made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or his urine comes out continually because the wound cannot close;
but nevertheless, strive to pull it out or to break it with pliers, until you pull it out in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rosewater and cold water, to calm the hot abscess; then support the patient on his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, wash the area well with oil and water, then treat it with diaphanicon and basilicon ointments until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come in the wound and corrosions, and congealings of blood in the bladder, and are thereby retained the urine, which is known in such a manner that without a jump with the urine: Then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will corrupt the bladder and rot it;
then wash the wound with water and wine and salt, and help him in all the ways that you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you bind his two thighs together, and gather the medicines onto the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the channel of the penis, and stuck inside, and the urine cannot escape; if you treat it as I have just said, that you cut it many times,  you are excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven it thus.
Take an iron rod according to this shape, and let it have three angles formed into a single fork.
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
then gently insert the rod into the penis, until it reaches the stone; and turn the rod in your hand against the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side;
then the urine will come out soon, then press your hand on that which remains of the stone inside the penis. Then it is quickly broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
And if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and loosen the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
Sometimes a stone is lodged in women, and if it happens, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
One is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a woman knowledgeable enough to expose herself to examination, especially if she is chaste.
And the third way is that perhaps one cannot find a woman skilled in this art of hands;
And the fourth way is that the woman's stone is deeper than the man's, so a deeper incision is necessary, and great fear is involved. And if necessity demands this, you must take a knowledgeable midwife, and they are hard to find, and if you cannot find one, seek a subtle and skilled female examiner;
and present a wise woman experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command regarding the examination of the stone; and carefully consider if the woman is a virgin:
and carefully consider if the woman is a virgin: then she should insert her finger into the foundation and seek the stone;
and if she finds it, she should press it under her finger, and she should be instructed to insert her finger into where the ailment is, and search and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, she should move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder down, until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut onto the stone at the root of the thigh, opposite the middle of the groin, where it appears to be lodged, and feel the stone in that area; and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then place the instrument in the incision, if you feel the stone, then enlarge the wound until the stone can be removed forcefully, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have ridges.
so know the appearances in order to know the outcome.
And if the blood is profuse, place powdered vitriol in the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stanched;
then return to your work until the stone is forcefully removed, and have the instruments that I have described in the extraction of stones, to assist you in your task;
and if the blood is profuse, and it is from a cut artery, place the powder on the place and bind it with bandages and dressings, and do not restart this, and leave the stone and do not extract it, lest the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is calmed, and the place is healed, return to your work until the stone is removed.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white pus, under the heart of the testicles, which contains the egg;
and is called "pus," and sometimes is properly in the membrane of the egg, so that one might think it another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white pus that we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow on the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: or it is a color declining to jaundice, or it is without red, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to recognize this assembly, for if it is white, as we have said, the abscess is round, not long, like the shape of an egg, and the testicles do not appear, because there is moisture all around it.
And if there is moisture in the proper fabric, the abscess is round with a part of the egg, and for that reason, one thinks it is another egg;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white surface, one feels it well;
Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, you test throughout the entire cavity, of which the shape is described beforehand. Based on this, then, which comes after the cavity, judge what is within.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body;
then lay him on his back, on something a little high, and put many cloths under him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the minister to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart of the testicles;
then take the spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise, down to the knife, and let your incision be perfectly straight, dividing the skin of the testicles until a white surface, and carefully scrape it away according to your ability;
then pierce the smooth surface with a large opening, and remove all the water, and then place your hooks, and stretch the surface upwards;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the surface; cut completely or in pieces, even the thin side, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle leaps out during your work, reposition it in its place once you have completed the work on the surface;
then join the two folds of the testicles with a stitch, and treat it like other wounds until it heals.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut off the testicle at the entire suspensory, remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if a wound is joined in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part in the same manner as you did the first, then wipe the blood away and put moistened wool in rose oil on the wound;
then cut the other part in the same manner as you did the first, then wipe the blood away and put moistened wool in rose oil on the wound; and place other wool moistened in wine and oil over the two testicles, and place over them doubled cloths, and tie it over the whole band according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with wool strips according to this pattern and sew them together at the groin of the breeches, and one of the edges should go from the base to the back, and the other to the side of the wound;
and the other two edges over the two arms, and let the whole band be gathered in the loop of the breeches;
And sometimes this wound is treated with cautery instead of iron, and you should take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and heat it as we have said, so that the white surface that contains the water is exposed;
Then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that surface with the prongs, and scorch it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in all the ways you can, until you have removed everything;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this work is more beneficial; and be careful of excessive bleeding, and make sure the cutting work is gentle;
and if anything opposes you, whether it be an abscess, bleeding, or something else, treat what opposes you, according to what has been previously said.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to endure this procedure because of its harshness, then perform a perforation, as I tell you.  And when you are certain, through the signs we have described, that the watery issue is external, have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the underpart with a wide spatula, and place the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be large, so that all the water runs freely;
then place cotton on the area and bandage it, and allow the remaining water to drain. Then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the water to escape from the wound, then you must insert a reed or the instrument used to draw water from hydrops, whose form is shown previously;
and enlarge the wound slightly, and know that the water returns and is collected after six months or a year, and when it is collected as before, then the patient will pass their days.
Know that in the section of this branch there are many dangerous dispositions, for which it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone;
and I will tell you the work and the appearances of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses arise in the body, and especially in the testicles; and it is by many means.
This is to know, by a superfluous acrid and sharp fluid, spread to the testicles, or by percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and finds no pain, and is a grievous abscess;
and perhaps it is a grievous, fearful, and painful abscess, of a fixed color, and sometimes comes from a rupture of an artery, or from swelling of a vein.
When it is by rupture of an artery, it is known by the disposition of a hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it at all.
The one made from swelling of a vein is known by its disposition to the pressure of the touch of the fingers, and one can well make the incision upon this semblance, and upon other flesh; and it is that you cut the core of the testicles, then lift the testicle upward, and pull the white sac away, and release the suspensory ligament from all sides of the testicle.
If the testicle is already embedded with these surrounding tissues, then it is necessary that you pull the testicle, and cut it;
And if it is air in the sac, or within the vessels, you must release all that tension and cut it roundly.
And if the base of the tissue is in the rear, you must cut it all, and remove the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess surrounded by a swelling resembling a boil, along with the softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he moves.
And the cure for this illness is as difficult and as dangerous as the previous one, and nonetheless we will tell you the method, according to what the ancients did.
You must have the patient sit on a raised seat, then place the suspensory of the testicles down by your fingers, encompassing all the vessels that are near the penis, and the master should grasp them and extend them firmly.
Then, with a sharp, wide spatula, cut through the tissues across the vessels, until they are exposed, and then cauterize from each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Then insert a needle, or if a doubled thread is available, tie it to the first point where the vein is found, and tie it again to the other end. Then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and remove the corrupt moisture.
Then treat the wound as the others where pus is generated, so that no vessels leak nourishing either testicle.
For by this, no harm will come, and if blood is found in all the vessels, it is necessary to remove the testicles from all the vessels. So that the testicle does not lose its nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and dry up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this ailment comes from the cut in the surface, or the stretching on the belly in the area of the groin, so that the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is in the surface, or from its stretching, and these two kinds come from many causes:
or from impact, or from jumping, or from straining, or from lifting heavy loads, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the stretching of the surface are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are even down to the depths, because the surface presses on the intestines.
And the signs are when it is from the section of the surface, that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess appears various, under the skin nearby, and this is due to the exit of the intestines and the body fleeing the surface.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the hernia, and are held in there, and cause the patient great suffering, especially when they are pressed.
And in these iron treatments, there is fear, therefore they should be avoided.
And the manner of the work is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine back into the wound with his hand, if it can be returned. then it should be supported on his neck, between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then stretch the skin over it and cut all the skin from the testicles lengthwise; then insert into the wound the blades of a knife, as needed to open the wound, and let it be such that the pus can come out;
then scrape the surface that is beneath the skin of the testicles, until the hard white surface is uncovered on all sides;
then place your index finger into that which surrounds the testicle, into that which is between the white surface that is beneath the skin of the testicle, and the second surface, and separate that which is behind the testicle and between the second surface;
and then move your right hand inside the skin of the testicles, and stretch the white surface upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all its surface towards the groin; and command the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and to loosen that which is behind the ligament;
and examine with your fingers if there is any part of the intestine wrapped around the hard white surface, and if you find anything, place it back into the abdomen below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of many threads, and place it in the posterior part of the surface, which is behind the skin of the testicles; after the groin, then cut the ends that appear from the threads, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the form of a cross, and tie the surface, which we have said is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong bandage of two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter, lest a foul abscess arise; and put the bandage again in line with the first bandage, long two fingers of that one, and after these two bandages, leave of the surface that is under the skin of the testicles the length of one finger; and after all the other according to the roundness that the egg carries;
then cut in the part that is under the skin of the testicles, as long as the blood flows, and the swelling, as we have said before;
then administer wool soaked in oil, and put it on the wounds, and apply the bandage that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white surface that we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, due to the fear of blood flow. For this happens many times, and leave the bandage until it comes off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, then it should be soaked with hot water, and put on what we have said, until it comes off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is completely healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this writing I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the cure with iron.
And the ancients said that it is made just as the writing that is bound to the tissue, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after the incision above or slightly below.
then cut in half, and treat the abscess of that which is open, until the vessel bleeds;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the bones, as we have said, and the place is opened;
and no intestines descend into the testicles, and if any do descend, it is little, and repairs itself every hour;
and nevertheless, if it remains too long in this state, the wound or ulcer grows, until the intestines descend;
and this happens due to the extension of the ulcer which is on the bones, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place softens and swells and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have previously said;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on their back between your hands, then cut the place of the broken flesh with a wide cut according to the amount of three fingers;
and then remove the ulcer which is under the skin that surrounds it, then take the scab and place it over the apparent place of the ulcer;
and press it to the bottom of the wound, then stitch the two visible places of the ulcer onto the head of the scab, and stitch both;
then remove the head of the scab, and do not cut the ulcer nor stretch the egg nor anything else, as I have made known to you in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
then treat it with the treatment for wounds. And when you cut the threads, cleanse it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The ulcer is constrained, and has no appearance in the rupture, and the cauteries are milder in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is noticeable.
and it is necessary, when one wishes to cure it, that one make the patient lie on his back, and cut the softened skin over the natural skin;
then bring the two edges together with a stitch, and if you wish, first stitch the excess softened skin with three or four firm stitches;
then cut between the stitches, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed and the threads fall out.
of the chastening
Know that chastening is forbidden in our law, and for that reason I would not speak of it at all in this book;
and is only necessary for two reasons:
one of which is that the patient should know how to respond when asked, and to know the cure;
and the other, because we often need to chastise certain animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say therefore that chastising is done in two ways: either by pulling or by cutting.
In the one that we do by pulling, we make the beast sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging. then take them in your hand, until they are restored and you no longer feel them.
Of the castration of the tail: You must restrain the beast, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspender, and cut on each testicle in one cut, when you have well scorched them.
and leave no spot of the surface and the subtle surface that is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is gentler than that done by pulling, because with pulling perhaps some part of the testicles remains, by which the beast desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears also like the figure of a woman's nature, or there is hair, and sometimes urine flows from it.
And the other manner is in women, and has on the vulva also like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure for man and woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and treat the wounds like other wounds;
In the second manner, of men whose urine flows through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tentigene is a growth of flesh on the natural part, so unsightly to behold; and some women have it as large as a hand, and that is the cure.
You must cut off the excess of the tentigene with your hand or with shears, and trim it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest blood flow, then cure it with other remedies until it is healed;
and another growth that arises from the mouth of the wound, filling it, and perhaps bursting forth, and is in the likeness of a pouch, and for this the ancients called it "pouch disease". If necessary, you must cut it, just as we said about the tentigene, and treat it until it is healed.
Erratic it is when the nature of the woman is not perceived, or the opening is small; and is either innate, or caused by illness that has come upon it;
and is either innate, or caused by illness that has come upon it; or it is by added flesh, or from a thin or thick surface, and is done deeply in the groin, or in the ribs, or underneath, or wherever it may be;
and it prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the bearing of flowers;
and the knowledge of these is by the examination of the wound.
If the numbness is clearly apparent, look to your fingers or the palm.
If it is from a thin surface, and it is close to the two lips, hasten and do it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and let the woman be on her back, her legs spread apart;
then stretch the two lips widely, so that the thin surface is round, and the numbness is relieved;
then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and place it on the spot, and let the woman lie on her side every day, so that it cannot adhere.
And if the surface is hard and thick, you must cut it with a spatule, shaped like a myrtle leaf.
If the numbness is of newly born flesh, then suspend it with a hook and cut it.
and have medicines that stop bleeding, such as dragon's blood, incense, together with egg white;
then apply a wide lead strip so that the wound cannot adhere;
and let it remain for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And when a suppurating tumor appears, it should be cut according to this method, if it is not a hardened abscess. For a hardened abscess in the flesh, one should not use cautery.
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins that bleed habitually, and when the hemorrhoids are old, they become painful.
And we have already discussed the likenesses of them, and the signs, and I will now describe those that receive a cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and painful swellings, when deep within the flesh and do not show on the surface, are not cured with cautery.
Those that are at the opening of the flesh, which can be felt, are those that can be cured.
Then you must put the woman in a cool room, then grasp the swelling with tongs and cut it at its roots, then powder over it with medicines that stop blood, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things;
then apply her feet to a wall for an hour, then place her in cold water;
and if a discharge of blood comes, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and gallnuts and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and oil, and make a poultice for her back.
And if it stops, that's good. If not, apply leeches to her back and breasts, without causing injury;
then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or elderberry juice with old wine, and apply to the affected area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and is like a rough lump; it must be cut as I have described the boil. and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the marrow, such as ulcers, stony abscesses, herpes, boil-like swellings, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and hot abscesses, and many other illnesses that I have mentioned in the division.
It is therefore necessary for me to describe in this treatise the hot abscess that arises in the marrow, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the treatment for it, look to see if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its onset, and full of heat and fever, and if it turns red, you can see it. Then do not rush to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is eased;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where he leans, and rests on his back and brings his feet to the outside of the leg;
and let his thighs be spread out, and let him put his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good bandage;
then suck the wound toward the right side, and apply the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the wound, of which the form comes next;
and it is necessary that when you wish to apply this instrument, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the wound, so that what enters inside the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the wound with cloths, so that the instrument does not hurt it;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is open, and one cuts it with a soft hand, it must be cut at the top, with a flat blade.
And when the boil is emptied, it is necessary that you put moistened lint in the wound, in rose oil, or in dry green oil.
and place the lint deep within the wound, and place clean, soaked wool over the wound and the lancet, soaked in water or boiled mallows.
then treat it after two days of suitable ointment, until it is healed.
and sometimes one cleans the wound with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water or boiled roots of lilies and aristolochia. Then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is again open at the wound, you must avoid the use of an iron cautery, but treat it as we have described in the division.
of childbirth It is necessary first to instruct the midwife on the nature of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing down, and desiring to smell the air:
then the child hastens to be born; then know that such childbirth is according to nature, and the child comes out under its head, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, you should gently press her belly, so that the child may come out quickly;
for when it descends under its head, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the mother is cleansed of her superfluities through good cleansing;
and that which comes out otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes out on its feet, and the body or head, or the hands, or comes out on its stomach, or often, and is perhaps turned on its neck, and by other bad positions;
Therefore, the midwife must be wise and skillful in these things, and avoid error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one should help her.
If the child comes out on its head by natural delivery, and the woman is laboring greatly, and her strength is weak, then have her sit on a chair, or let the other women hold her up.
and apply oil or fennel that is cooked, and then the midwife places the small spatula, whose shape is like this, between her fingers: and split the afterbirth, and cut with a fingernail until the moisture that is inside flows out;
and grasp the woman's abdomen so that the child descends, and if it does not descend, the woman must be given an enema of fenugreek and sesame oil;
then have her drink and sneeze out the condisi, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: Then the child will emerge now.
And if the two hands come out forcefully, you must gently reposition them little by little; and if they cannot enter, place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet; then lift the seat to the ground, and support the woman so that she does not fall when it is lifted;
and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, cut the hands with the knife that is placed before, and remove the child, and reposition it equally.
of the child's exit from between its feet When the child comes between its feet, it must be pushed upward; and then turn it slowly, until it is even;
then take it by the feet and extend it slowly.
If it jumps up to the thighs, then instruct them to grasp it, and make it sneeze with a suggestion; if it jumps out, if God wills.
And if it does not jump out as we have said, then turn it slowly, until it is according to its natural shape. For then it is easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take a linen cloth, and oil of sisymbrium, and melted gum, and grind all in a mortar; and put on the affected area of the woman this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to below the ribs;
and when she is softened from below, then apply a poultice of myrrh and place it below, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and restrain her mouth and nose, and gently grasp her stomach, for the child will jump out now.
from the birth of the child on her knees When the child comes in this form, the midwife will place her hands gently; then she should be held on her back, her feet hanging down, and lying on the bed; and gently fold her hands, and then grasp her hands on the belly, and remove the cushions underneath until she is positioned downwards; and if the child does not move, then take her feet and move them forcefully, then move her belly upwards, then place your hands; and gently pull the child; and instruct the woman to bear down until the child comes out.
of the birth of the child who comes out with one hand hanging down It is necessary to devise a way to bring the hand back: if it cannot be brought back, then have the woman get up and leave;
if she cannot walk, then have her lie down on the bed, and straighten her legs firmly;
then administer the poultice that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, have her sit on the seat, then try to bring the hand back; and bring the child out according to the natural figure, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
from the birth of the child on her neck, and have her hands outstretched, and her face turned towards her mother's back. it is necessary that the attendant hold his hand, then turn it slowly, and draw it out gently;
and when it is even, place the natural mucus of the palate and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move slowly;
and when you have done this, make her sit on the seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner for the entire secondine.
in this same manner for the entire secondine. When it comes forth in this manner for the entire secondine, then cut the secondine with your fingernail until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the bud so that it is not retained, and the child dies;
then place the child inside, until you have put it as it should be, and instruct the woman that she take it every so often:
of the issue of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, and it rarely happens. Two are a strange thing, and do not live long.
Two are a strange thing, and do not live long. I know that they multiply, and are separated by the surface that divides them, which is tied to the womb;
and sometimes they emerge just as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they emerge painfully, then the cure as we have said, and let the bandage be subtle, and let it do what it does quickly and lightly; and do it as it deserves to be for health. of many children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb as one, or two, or three, or four, or five, or six, or seven, or more up to fifteen, and are completely formed in the form of a child through the measurement of the wise glorious one, and it is necessary for the midwife to know all this, for perhaps similar things happen to her; so do according to what is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat the woman of the dead child in the womb, as I said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to manual work; so it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or fear of death;
so it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the minister should hold her from two sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled down by the child;
then rub the mouth of the child with moist oils with the mucilage of elecampane and fenugreek and flaxseed, then anoint the child's hands with these oils and these mucilages;
then gently put them in the child's mouth, then find the place where it puts its fingernails, which are suitable for that, and take care if the child is prepared to descend on its head;
if it fixes the fingernails in its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the throat or near the ribs, and if the descent is on the feet, it fixes it or pierces it in the ribs or the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the nail with his right hand, and place the curve between the fingers of his left hand, and gently place the whole hand on it, and fix the nail in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
then fix another nail, or a third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then stretch it equally by moving it from one side to the other, to make it move, and let the nails be toothed to hold it in place, as is the shape here:
And if part remains, then anoint some of his fingers with oil, and place them on that part, and pull the other part;
and if any part remains, then place this nail in a higher position, and do so until it comes entirely out.
And if one hand comes in front of the other, and it cannot be pulled back due to the constriction, then you must wrap it with a cloth, until it comes entirely out; then cut it at the joint of the sole or with a knife, and so you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the passage is narrow, or there is a sharp point gathered on the head, then you must place the spatumile thorn between your fingers, and pierce the head and extract the point; or you cut it with the instrument called "almidach", from which the form comes with the instruments or chapter that comes after this one;
and likewise do this if the child has a large head naturally;
and then pull the bones with pliers, and if the head springs out and it is tight with force, let it be broken, until the moisture that is in the wound flows out;
and if it cannot come out, then cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture runs.
And if the child is on its feet, then the attraction is slight, and the straightening to the mouth of the marrow is slight.
And if it is narrow in the belly or in the breast, then you must pull it out with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and cut the belly or the breast until the moisture within runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the surgeon puts his hand deep into the marrow, and pulls it until the mouth of the marrow; then puts one or two hooks in it and pulls it forcefully;
and if the mouth of the marrow is narrowed due to a hot abscess that has arisen there, then one should not work on it, but rather apply moist and greasy things; and apply poultices, and bathe in soft and moist water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can place it upright, then apply what we have said about a living child;
and if one does not have the strength, then pull it forcefully in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then apply what we have said for hot abscesses that arise in the marrow;
and if bleeding occurs, then it should be placed in constricting water, and apply other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose belly a child had been dead, then another was sewn on top of that one, and the other also died. After a long time, an abscess appeared in the groin, and it swelled so much that it opened, and began to discharge profusely.
I was called to treat it, and I pondered it for a long time, and could not close the wound.
I applied a strong-drawing plaster, and one bone came out, and after a few days another. I was greatly amazed, because the belly has no bones.
I thought it was the bones of a dead child.
I probed the wound, and drew out many bones, until the woman was in a better condition; and the woman lived a long time like that, and a little pus would come out from the place;
and I have only recorded this chapter because, when the master finds a strange thing, that he may know how to apply a remedy.
Here after comes the form of the press, with which the books were made;
and two turns at the two ends of the two links. However, the horns should be finer than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood;
and let the mouth of the tube be one finger in width, and the margin of the trees one finger, and in length one palm and a half; and in the middle of the two links, there should be two joints of this same tube, which should be fixed in one and the other, of half a palm in length or a little more;
and these two joints are placed in the mouth of the mortise to open when the two horns are turned.
Another form, similar but finer and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, resembling pliers; and have two joints at the two ends, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you wish to open the mortise with the whole instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, feet dangling and legs open, then place the two joined joints into the mortise, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then operate your hand on the whole instrument, as you did with the pliers, according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the mortise, until the joint does what it wants.
These instruments are all topped, and their likenesses are multiplied; and when the master has them prepared, the work is more hasty, and higher for the men according to their quantity.
Do not delay the instrument until you have prepared it, for their necessities are not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, you should instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a concoction, and hold her hands over her mouth and nose; and if she jumps due to this, good.
If not, she takes a pot, and makes a hole in the lid, and puts herbs that can open the passage of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in water over the fire;
then place one end of the cane in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the passage of the womb, and keep it there until the vapor reaches the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. Then the afterbirth comes out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out easily, instruct the woman to moisten her left hand in oil of sesamum or in decoction of elecampane, and then place it in the passage, and seek the afterbirth; and when she has found it, she should take it and gently and straightly pull it out, so that the womb does not rupture during the extraction;
but it must be moved gently to the right and to the left, and then pulled; it will come out and separate.
And if the opening of the womb is tightly constricted, we have described the treatment of sneezing and herbal fumigations;
and if it is not helped by all that we have said, be careful not to force it when pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the opening of the womb, you tie it to the woman's thigh, then administer a four-herb ointment clyster; if it will rot and return, and will come back.
However, when it rots, a foul odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Therefore, suitable fumigations are necessary for this.
None of the ancients have proven fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The shape of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman to retain the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is like a chain, and one places the narrow end in the vagina, and the wide ends over the fire;
and let the fumigations be over the embers, and the scab until it is wasted, and begin another.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but rather have a small plug of thin flesh. Then it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that plug with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and to avoid touching it.
then place moistened wool in wine and oil, then apply ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will plug up again, place a lead chain in the opening and leave it in place for several days, and have it removed when the child is ready to go into rooms.
And sometimes these plugs result from the closure of a wound or abscess. If so, that closure must be cut. It should be treated as we have said about the lead chain.
Fistulas that come from under the fundament are swellings, and swellings that come from near the fundament, or in the space between the two parts, have a fistula or several.
And when that swelling is old, it opens, and pus, white or thin, oozes, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And they are recognized by the fact that either an expulsion or flatulence comes out of them when the patient expels, and perhaps a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce down to the bladder, and down to the middle of the penis; and they reach down to the hip joint, and to the end of the thigh.
And thus one recognizes a penetrating fistula in the fundament, and not a non-penetrating one: and it is that you place your index finger in the fundament, and insert a fine needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no winding.
And if there is winding, then insert a thin lead tent, or horsehair, until you feel the tent or hair against your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and it does not come from the opening of any discharge, wind or pus, as we have said: know that it does not penetrate at all; therefore hurry in the cure.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the passage of urine, then urine leaks out and cannot be sealed by medicine.
If it is pierced to the joint of the thigh, the tent penetrates to the place; if there is no twist and the cause of the pain is around it, then it constantly swells, and no medicine or ointment helps it to heal.
And in these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure other than labor and the folly of the many meddlers.
In one that is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of health through iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the sick person lies on their back in your hands;
and the person raises their legs up to their thighs, and has their thighs inclined to their stomach; then place a copper tent, or lead if there is a twist, until you know where the tent is placed.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must place your index finger there, then feel if the tent has pierced it;
and if you feel between your finger the surface or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; if not, do not work at it any more, for it cannot be cured.
One says, however, that some can be cured, but this is rare;
and the aid that is done is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and puts it, all hot, into the fistula, until it comes near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that these misplaced flesh are burned, which resemble a bird's feather;
and then treat with moistened tents in butter, until that flesh comes out, then treat with an ointment that generates flesh and closes it.
If it is thus healed, that is good.
If this, in no other way can be healed;
and if the tent goes between, and does not pierce to the finger that is at the foundation, and between your finger and the tent is a thick covering of flesh or skin, and you see the fistula at this which succeeded the covering of the heart; if you cut at the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward, and then cauterize afterward, until it reaches the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those misplaced flesh that look like a bird's feather, and nothing remains.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
For fire cauteries assemble two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added flesh, and the stopping of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat the wet tents with butter or crushed herbs, until the place casts pus, and thus the burned flesh will come out in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments containing strong, lasting substances, and these are the drying medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and will not return.
And if a fistula extends to the very bottom of the foundation, and is separated from the body, then place your finger into the foundation, and examine that.
If you feel the tent, and between it and the cloth or the skin, or the flesh, where it is close to piercing, there is nothing but a path of trust and hope, through the administration of one of the three ways:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it completely, or if you can, then you place tents and treat it as before;
and do not go too deeply, lest you sever the attachment holding the foundation, and the discharge come forth without your will. then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it, since it is cut from the foundation, either with a tent or with another suitable instrument; then cleanse the corrupted flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then endeavor to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula outside the foundation:
then endeavor to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula outside the foundation: it will be a lighter thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are in this manner: and it is when you place the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the foundation next to the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the head according to this form: And he puts one thread twisted into two, and puts the tent with all the thread into the fistula until it is at the head.
If it is piercing into the margin of the foundation inside, then pull the thread from that hole, as you put your finger in the foundation;
and pull the head of the thread, and join the two ends together, and tighten one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and it falls away;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in every way you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not appropriate to cut too deep for the lacing, and then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spine's spatula, with which one cuts the fistula, is very sharp on one side and sharp. and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the fundament, like a grain of resin, and there are small and large ones, and blood often flows from them, and there is one or more of them, and they are below the fundament and at the top of the fundament;
but those that are below have little moisture, and often discharge a little yellow water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those that have them inside the fundament is that you instruct the patient to strain himself to go to the chamber pot, so that the fundament pushes outward, and the string appears; if you hurry, and hold it with tongs, or you hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the pincers cannot hold them because of their moisture, then take them with a cloth, or cotton, or a piece of chamelot; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and powder over them some warm powders that are in the place of cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then cure them with other cures until they are healed;
and if the fundament cannot come out, then enema the patient with a biting and harsh enema to wash out what is in the fundament, so that it may come out openly; If the patient is recovering, and if the threads are loose from the fundament, then the cure is slight;
If the patient is recovering, and if the threads are loose from the fundament, then the cure is slight; and you should take them with your fingernail or pliers, and cut them, then cure them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they fear the incision by iron. Then it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
Then it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: Take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread through and pierce the needle on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and tightly pull the thread, then tie the thread, and remove the needle, and do likewise for all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood;
then place a wet bandage in rose oil or in ointment on the foundation, and put it on the foundation, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall out, and when they are fallen out, treat them with ointments and other remedies, until they are healed.
of the dryness of the foundation Many times there is dryness of the bowels, and through constriction of nature, and when the disease is old and medicine is of no use. If it is necessary that you scrape with a spatula or your fingernail the scab on top, which does not allow it to moisten; then treat it until it is healed as is appropriate;
and if it cannot heal, then resume the scraping more forcefully than before, until it bleeds a great deal, and is scraped raw; then treat it until it is healed.
there is trembling. A worm is a small, false appearance, around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it causes cold, and it is felt as if by trembling, and it spreads throughout the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is that you take a stick from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that stick on the trembling, so that the circle encompasses the trembling completely around it; then turn your hand over the entire stick so that you cut completely around the trembling, and push it deep, and remove the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, you can make one from a copper or iron stick in this shape, and let it be thin underneath and pointed above: not piercing, in order to hold it by the finger, and press it.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as it is described earlier in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or gold, or of molten or hammered copper;
and sometimes these instruments are made small or large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those, then, administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small.
Those, then, administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is thus wider at the top, where the belly is bound in this manner:
and there should be a separation where the belly is bound, as you see, and the bottom be pierced;
and have two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and let the belly, where the medicines are placed, be of an animal's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and have one line of space between each hole, then put a strong thread of strong thread twisted in an X or figure-of-eight around, and assemble the belly as a goat's; and when the medicine is inside, tie it with a strong thread to the instrument in front, then administer the clyster;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the minister squeezes it with both hands together, until it is all empty, then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise their legs towards the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, let it come out as much as possible; and if he sleeps soundly one night, so much the greater aid.
And if you use the clyster in a disease of bowel discharge, and the medicine hurries to come out, then repeat it until he is healthy.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of a subtle clyster, on which the skin is constricted:
We have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the treatments of hands and medicine, according to their completion.
I say that wounds are diverse, according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and from what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of stones, and the cutting of swords and knives, or of lances or staffs or arrows, or of similar things;
or those that are made according to the places on the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the feet, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure for each wound, and will begin with simple head wounds, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, if it is from a thrown stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear a rise of hot abscess: if you make it bleed immediately from the cephalic, even if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side of the injured part;
and keep the patient from the repletion of wine and heavy foods.
And if it does not wish to bleed, let his food be lessened, and let him drink no wine, nor eat any meat;
and place on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton soaked only in rose oil, or in astringent wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, place on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not changed by the air, the powder, which I will tell you a little later;
and if the burn has changed it, put on some ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together with sutures, bring them together with stitches, as I will say about wounds to the belly, the side.
If the wound is exposed to the bone, and hangs, and holds only by a little, cut it off; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore tough flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat hearty foods, such as brains and cooked wheat, as well as poultry, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it is not close to the bone, cut away all the rot, and throw it away, then treat it.
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then seek out the artery, and if you find it torn, tie it with a thread; and if this does not help at all, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the cure is light: and it is that you put this powder in, which will close up before the burn has moved.
And the manner of the powder is: take frankincense one part; dragon's blood two parts; live charcoal three parts, and the powder subtly, and fill the wound, and tightly bind it, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bandage it well, and leave it unloosened, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses only charcoal, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but that the burn has not changed the wound.
And if the burn has changed the wound, especially if it is deep, then one does not put this powder in it;
but puts on some digested ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it forms a crust; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a broken bone comes with the wound, and it is small, then remove it with subtle forceps;
and I will tell you about head injuries afterward.
of the wound in the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one of the head, but if the nerves or arteries of the neck are cut.
If it is a nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave the cure, and put nothing constricting on it, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is also with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be soft, like warm water with sweet oil, and warmed water likewise, and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it up and bind it with bandages, then cure it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is festered and full of pus, pierce it in the lowest part;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding results, cauterize it, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the conduit is guarded, through which the food passes, sew the heart to the throat's cartilage, and do not touch the throat, but reset it according to its natural form; and then restrain it, and leave it for some days, then cure it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, seek to remove it; and if there are pieces of bone, if you can, remove all of them; and those that you cannot get, let them be until the wound festers, and the discharge is separated and loosened;
and if the wound is fresh, then powder it with the powder that I have described. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, cure it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, observe if gas escapes from the wound when the patient exhales: Then know that the wound is fatal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, then do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it tightly because of the blood, lest it stagnate deeply, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply a drawing ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the wound to soak up any moisture, and let the patient sleep on the wound for three, or four, or more days; then there will be no spasm, nor tremor, nor constriction of the heart or sinews; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is healing. Then treat it with dressings and other remedies until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and opens again, then know that there is a fistula;
if you treat it as you should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and it is simple, or on the chest or back, treat it as you would a wound on the front. if it is large, with stitches;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is embedded in the bone, and has broken pieces, then dress the wound, and pull out any loose fragments; and if they are not loose, then allow the wound to fester, as extraction will be easier;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The rupture of the belly is great, medium, and small;
from the great wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, jump out, thus causing their penetration;
and the treatment is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because one has more trouble putting the intestines back in if one does not put them back in quickly;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, so they are harder to put back in, and therefore a medium wound is more difficult to treat, because putting the intestines back in their place is harder than in other cases.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common treatments occur in the treatment of the belly, and the treatment of other wounds of the body, and two other treatments that are specific, are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more specific to the treatment of the belly, and I will explain each one and declare them.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestines has come out, and it is difficult to put it back, this is by one of the two methods: or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestines are swollen due to the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a similar cloth in only lukewarm water, or you boil it in water with saffron, cypress and spices, and bathe the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes use astringent wines, and are milder than water alone for deflating.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water or cooked rue and mallows, for by this the entrance is eased a little;
and if it cannot enter, then slightly cut the wound with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is milder than the incision, and no one should cut without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
if it cuts within the curve and not outside, and see here the shape: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine bursts out, then put it back in its natural form in its proper place, if you have the power, for this is worth a lot.
When the wound is large, and it is in the part below the belly, then it is necessary for you to make the sick person lie on their back, and put their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the part below the belly, then put the head and chest higher than the parts below, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, then direct your attention to ensuring the wounded part is higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in wounds large and small.
In small wounds, apply what is suitable for you, then have between your hands a compassionate assistant who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings together the edges;
And this is the common way of sutures, and that you take a needle or several, according to the quantity of the width of the wound, then leave from the beginning of the wound one inch of space, and there place a needle with a strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the inner skin, which is beneath the skin, until you pierce it from that part, and bring together the two edges of the inner skin together;
then tie a double thread around the needle from both sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound, and then leave one inch of space, and place another needle there;
then tie the thread as you did with the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to your need for needles, until the entire wound is tied;
and let the needles be medium, between fine and coarse, for fine needles cut all the flesh, and too coarse ones cannot enter well: Therefore, they must be medium;
and you should not thrust the needles too far into the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before it is closed;
and then cut the heads of the needles so that they do not wound the patient while they sleep, and put tents or flaps on the heads of the needles to hold them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this manner of sewing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles suffice.
The second type of stitching is common, and involves bringing together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the flesh with a needle and a strong, medium thread;
And when you have pierced all four edges together, bring the needle back to the starting point, in the manner in which one sews cloth;
and put a space between each stitch the size of a little finger;
This stitch is known to men, and I sewed a wound a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was over a palm in size, and the intestines were protruding about two palms in length, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I repositioned the intestines after 24 hours, and the wound was closed up within 15 days, and I treated it, and it healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and that was a miracle.
And I did not treat it with any ointment, for I was in a place where none could be found, nor any other medicine. and I would place old cotton on the wound twice a day, and wash it with honey water until it healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper ways of stitching:
Take the needle, and pierce it from the outside to the inside;
When it has pierced the heart of the right to the right, then leave the head of the thread or stitch where you have pierced the needle, and make it pierce from the inside to the outside;
and the understanding of this stitch is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave one side of the thread, and take it up again on the other, until the stitch is complete.
The second way of stitching, which Galen properly calls, is like some people do, who join the two parts together naturally, and place one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
Pierce a needle at the nearby end of the thread, and pierce only that spot, and leave the two ends of the thread; Then turn the needle, and pierce it from the outside to the inside, to the two ends of the thread;
Then pierce each from the outside to the inside, into two other ends of the thread that are on the other side;
and that is the middle way of stitching and the most common.
Galen said this, and some testify, that one should sew the belly with two needles, with a thread on each;
and one should put one needle on one side, and the other on the other, in the manner of those who sew leather straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more serious than in other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the heat has changed it, then replace the intestine and stitch it;
then put on the powder of healing flesh, and if the heat has changed it, put on any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and cut the threads, and let the seams and the bandages be bound; then treat the wound as the others, until it is healed;
and if you do not have medicines, as soon as it begins to heal, put on old cotton, and move it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple;
and if you doubt that the wound will spread to the main limbs, you should soak light wool in tempered oil, or in rose oil, and place it around the joints, and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or rot in the boils, and this often happens, then irrigate them with warmed black wine, especially if the rot reaches the intestines;
and pierce it open, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine called "jejunum" cannot heal when wounded, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are in it, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the closeness of its nature to the nerves.
And if the piece of the wound jumps out, then put it back in the same way as the intestines, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and turned dark or black, then you must bind the dark place so that no blood flows there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut what is between the ligatures, and hang the two pieces hanging from the part below the wound until the end to lighten the extraction when the pieces fall out, and the wound swells.
of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is round, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw a man wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it became infected and became a fistula, and there was discharge and gas;
I applied treatment according to what I could, and I did not cease to treat until he was healed, and the place was closed.
And when I saw it close, I feared that the patient would have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, and eating and drinking;
And some experimenters said that when a small wound is in the intestine, it should be bound in this way: Take a large piece of linen, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the linen has opened its mouth, place it over the two edges so that it tightens around the mouth;
and then cut the linen's head off, and this is held so that it cannot come loose, then place another piece of linen afterward in the same way as before, until the wound is completely covered; and stitch the wound.
This head will burn within the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one may bind the intestine with a thin thread that is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this way:
Take the end of this intestinal thread, which should be very lean, and then tie to the end of this thread a thin twisted linen thread, then put the thread in the needle, and stitch the intestine, and pull it into the rupture;
and this method of stitching linen is no more than according to the way of faith and hope;
And if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the large intestines, there is no remedy or skill, but only subtlety.
of fistula or where it may be Know that any wound or abscess, when it becomes chronic, is universally called "fistula," especially when it is festering and discharging pus.
And a fistula, according to the truth, is a knotted, hard, and white swelling, where no pain is felt, and is as festering as the quill of a bird;
and sometimes clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes small, and other times considerable;
and I have spoken of it in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and there is no flesh, is only due to one of the eight causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or by its malice; or because there is hard flesh within, and on the edges, that does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the material is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a type of pestilence; or because the property in the region is slow to digest, and delays healing, and swells by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Or it is necessary that I make you know the cure of a fistula which is done by manual work.
Know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that arise from large veins, and arteries, and nerves, or on the surface, or in the intestines, or in the bladder, or in some of the ribs, or in the spine of the back, or in any joint of the hands or feet; and some that occur in the region of the primary limb and in similar places.
And all fistulas of this kind are difficult to heal, and there is only toil and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not reach the place I have mentioned, and you are confident in the cure, and you want to know it, then take a bronze or iron probe, if the fistula is straight, and seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, seek it with a slender lead probe, for lead bends easily around the curves;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot properly seek it with probes, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture will flow from one opening to another, and cleanse it;
then seek it wisely as best you can, so that you know if there is bone or nerve, and it is deeply embedded, and ask the patient about the pain he feels when you press with your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the pus and corrupt flesh that is within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is deep and directly located, you must cut deeply as much as you can, then put moistened medicated probes into the opening, and push them to the head of the fistula until the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that promote healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not hinder the main limbs, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then scrape away until the corruption is entirely removed, then treat it with things that promote flesh growth until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns to its former state, know that you have not reached the source:
then uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, that is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep for you to reach; there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it with pincers, pull it with a suitable instrument, and if there are many bones, pull them all out, and leave not one behind;
and if the moisture resists, and there is no mistake or fear, cut through the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, put something that produces decay on the wound, and leave it until the area around the bones is decayed, and then the bones will be more easily extracted.
And if it is a large bone, such as of the leg or thigh, only delay the decay until the blackness is entirely removed, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it should be cut and scraped completely to the corruption, and then treated until it is healed.
and I will tell you about a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take an example and assistance in your work.
There was a young man, around 30 years old, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that originated within the body, until the matter reached his leg, and it became swollen with a large abscess, and there was no cause for hesitation in opening it;
but the doctors, in their foolishness, worked so much on it that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many openings appeared that continually discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many doctors applied treatment for about two years, and there was no wise person in the art of medicine until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which they were treating it, and the great quantity of matter that flowed from the openings; and the young man's body became red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these openings, and then searched all the openings, and found that they were interconnected from all parts of the leg.
I quickly cut into one of the openings until I exposed part of the bone, and found it corrupted and decayed, and the corruption reached the bone within.
I cleaned the part of the corrupted bone that appeared to me, and thought there was no other corruption, except for what I removed;
and began to restore the wound with immediate medicines for a long time, and it could not heal;
and then I began again, and exposed the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing into the bone, and cleaned it, and then removed it, and I tried to heal the area; but I could not until I cut around a palm's width of the bone, and the bone was entirely softened, then I restored it with medicines; and it was healed and mended quickly, and it was not necessary to start the work again except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure, and for the fear of death I had of him. For because of the evacuation, he often coughed, but he was completely healed, and a hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and it was of good disposition, and did not cause any harm or hindrance whatsoever, neither in the present nor in the future.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be treated in this manner: Take a bandage, and bind it to the head of the exposed bone, and instruct someone to extend it upwards; and place another bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage, and bind it over the flesh that is on top of the bone, and extend the head, so that you pull the corrupted flesh underneath, and uncover the flesh over the place where you want to work, so that the bandage does not injure the flesh;
and place a brand or a plank underneath the bone to help cut away the corrupted flesh;
and continue as long as one can see and feel the corruption, and do so again.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not show, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part, then uncover all of the flesh;
Then place a brand underneath, and then bandage from one side to the other of the corruption, and let the bandage be the length of the corruption, a little, as we have said;
And if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and bandage the bone where it is on the other side;
And if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut it;
And if the corruption is in the finger of the hand, or in the finger of the foot, that is a very strong thing, but nevertheless, you must investigate this corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way you can, but do not let the vein or nerve hinder you;
and know that the instruments and saws for cutting these bones are numerous, according to the arrangement of the bones and the appearance of the wounds, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and therefore, for every kind of work, one must prepare the appropriate instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the ways of illnesses; so consider the instrument you need according to what is appropriate.
The shoulder might dislocate either due to internal causes or because of fire;
And when you have treated that corrosion with medicine, and they are of no use, then it is necessary to cut that limb down to the place where the corrosion occurs, so that the patient escapes death, or the worse evil, which is the loss of the limb;
And the sign of this is that the limb turns black, as if it were burned by fire, and after the blackness, the corrosion might spread from member to member, and take over the whole body;
So hurry to cut it, and if it's caused by the bite of venomous creatures, such as sea scorpions and vipers and similar ones, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it, and do not allow it to reach the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm.
And if it reaches the arm, cut it at the elbow.
And if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no strong remedies are of any use beyond the extent of their virtue.
And do exactly the same when the corrosion comes to the foot. If it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint.
And if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot. And if it ascends to the leg, cut at the knee joint.
And if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die.
And the manner of cutting or severing the limb is that you bind it above and below, and let one minister pull one of the bandages downward, and another minister the other bandage upward, and you separate the flesh between the two bandages to a width of one span, until the bone is exposed;
then cut or sever it, and place a linen strip on each side, so that the severed part does not touch the healthy area, and cause further injury and abscess to the patient.
And if a bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some constricting powders.
Then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man on his foot:
a black mark appeared, resembling a burn from fire, and this corrosion first came to his toe of the foot, until it affected the entire foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he quickly cut off the foot, and was healed;
and a long time later, the corrosion returned to the toe of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied things that cause repulsion after cleaning the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not, for I had hope of repelling the matter; and also feared that if I cut off his hand, he might die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and quickly cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recorded this only so that others might do likewise if they need it.
Sometimes an abscess occurs in a fleshy area and remains so long that it gathers much pus; and then it bursts and the pus escapes, and the area remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin above is as thin as fine cloth, and does not reach down to the bone or to the nerve, and such an ailment is called "sain," and not "fistula";
but if it extends so far that it reaches the bone deep within, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you should cut that skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not heal from its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with a clyster thus:
Examine if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes from it has a foul odor, then clyster it with Egyptian medicine made thus: Take oil, and litharge, equally, and put them in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine turns red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of it according to your need, and mix it with water and honey, and clyster the swelling, and constrict the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the swelling is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed;
and sometimes, when this medicine is not available, the swelling is clystered with water and ashes.  Take ashes from a vine-wood, pour water over them, then strain it, and use it as a clyster, until you know that the swelling is thoroughly cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then clyster with water and honey, or if there is a little bit of litharge crushed in it; or you can clyster with honey and mixed wine, where honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine makes the swelling dry;
and when you have done this, and are certain that the swelling is thoroughly cleansed, then clyster with that which promotes flesh growth there.  Take a diafinit plaster, made with rose oil and wine;
or you clyster with various medicines and ointments, whose properties I have described in the treatment of ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the clyster tube cannot enter, then enlarge it slightly with an iron implement, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basil ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too large, then suture it, leaving only the area where the clyster can enter; and if the opening that discharges pus is on the upper part, cut it at a lower point.
And if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, arrange it so that the pus runs to the lowest point; for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to form, and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, arrange it in this manner: that the pus flows easily downward, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus flows easily downward, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to place on the swelling, and spread a linen cloth over the entire swelling; then cut as much of the area around the opening of the swelling as is slightly larger than the first, then spread a soft ointment onto another cloth according to the size of the opening and place it over the opening of the swelling to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except once after many days;
and the one that is over the opening of the swelling, remove often to remove the pus, and know what comes from the pus, whether it is venom or little or enough, or digested or indigested;
and watch if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has spread in such a way and you see the nature that leaps up over the opening of the swelling, then know that the swelling is already healing, and health approaches;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle poisons flow after a long time, do not despair of health, for health approaches.
For there are men whose flesh takes a long time to heal in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
And if undigested pus bursts from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal;
And if the swelling is slow to heal and is prolonged, add dry and moist medicines in substance and dry in virtue, such as a diaphanous ointment, for it contains a large amount of vitriol, and this is the last medicine;
Take diaphanous ointment, and make it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with equal parts of old wine in substance;
Then apply it and use it;
And this same thing will be better if it is cooked in fat when diaphanous ointment is not available, or you take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and grind them, and powder them over the honey when it is over the fire;
And then apply it in strips, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes an astrologer administers long roots of a celestial lily, which is also like the flour of vetch and centaury; and use it as a simple or compound remedy: Grind them, and make them into powder, and put them over the honey I mentioned, and use it;
And if the treatment is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; if the treatment of the fistula, as we have said before.
Panaricium is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the finger or toe, or perhaps arises on other fingers;
and when it is aged, and one does not take care of it, then a pus-filled abscess comes, and runs and casts pus until it runs the root of the nail, and perhaps runs the whole of it;
and the corruption reaches the bone, so that there comes a putrid pain, and the finger's head is swollen, and the colour is dark.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, then you must cut away all the excess that remains of the nail with a hot iron, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is very much a help if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, then you must place a piece of wood under the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it upwards, and cut that flesh subtly and gently, and apply burning and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh to remove everything. then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, then cut it and remove it forcefully, because as long as the corrupted bone remains, it cannot heal.
And if you see the finger corrupting, cut it in half in the middle as previously described, then treat it until it is healed.
And if it is struck and bruised, and it feels great pain, then you must first ease the pain.
Then cut the nail of the spur with a sharp blade, cutting across the top, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain.
And if it happens, place something upon it that soothes.
The swelling that arises in the hands of some men by chance is entirely fleshy, and sometimes there is bone, and sometimes there is a nail, and some arise at the root of the joint, or the origin is in certain bones of the fingers.
Those that arise in any part of the finger do not move, and those that arise at the joint of the finger, sometimes move.
The size of the fleshy one is slight, in this manner: Cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
Those that arise at the root of the joint are difficult to cure: So hold it from the cut.
In that which arises or is due to the posterior part, you must first cut the flesh roundly down to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable blade for it, then cure it until it is healed.
The swelling that comes to the fingers together comes from birth, or from the healing of a wound, or from burning by fire, or similar things.
You must cut that swelling, so that the fingers return to their natural shapes; then place between them soaked cloths or bandages in rose oil, so that they do not swell; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is appropriate.
If swelling comes to any of his fingers with the palm, cut that swelling as is appropriate.
Vis are thick veins wrapped full of melancholic superfluities, that come to many members of the body;
and more happens in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you must give him a purge of the bile, and then a treatment from the basilica.
The cure of iron is thus according to two ways: one is that they are cut, and black blood is drawn out; and the other way is that you bind the vein, and draw it entirely out.
The cutting is thus according to this manner: First, apply a very hot water poultice to the leg until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh to below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, two, or three places, with a wide cut, and raise and draw out the black blood into your hand, from one end to the other, as much as the patient's strength can tolerate;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods causing black bile;
and recommence the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and harms the patient.
The raising of it is according to this method: raise the patient's leg, if there is much hair, then put it in the bath, and apply hot water to the leg until it turns red, and the veins swell;
and if you have no bath, warm it at the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the top of the knee to the ankle;
then open the skin with a knife, and scrape the vein on both sides, until it appears when touched;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then push it out from beneath, until it is lifted from the skin, and then gently cut it with a knife, and then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the instrument, as you did before, and cut it with another knife, as you did first;
then cut another incision, or more if needed, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it down to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision, until it is entirely out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then insert a strong double-threaded needle, and bind and pull it, and put a knife underneath, and turn your hand to one side and the other, until it comes out; and be careful not to cut it, for if it cuts, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and this causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, place wet wool on the wound, soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, twisted, and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it twistingly, but do not cut it; and pull it as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vein is curved, and does not cut straight, so as not to cut the vein;
and is of a large curve, for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein, but be thick, as we have said, and this is the shape:
This vein is intertwined in the legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and in earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the rot that comes under the skin, as it comes within the body of serpents and worms, intertwined between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that there comes a very great inflammation in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like a root of a plant.
When the head appears, you should wrap around a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces, and the knot, and leave the lead hanging on the leg, and every time a drop comes out to the outside, wrap it around the lead, and the knot;
and if it is too long, cut off a portion, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it is entirely out. for if you cut it, it will return into the flesh, and cause abscess and rot in the place, and a bad illness.
for which reason it is necessary that it be treated little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body.
and sometimes this vein, when treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it issued ten palms in length, and when you cut it, it will burst one ray or opening, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out.
and let the matter within be emptied, and apply healing remedies to the place to prevent any rot for some time, then treat it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it opens in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many openings appear from which blood spurts out.
Then treat it as we have said before.
of worms that grow between the skin and flesh This disease is called "cattle disease" in our land, because it often occurs in cattle, and it is a small worm that grows between the skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, and one can feel it clearly moving from limb to limb, until it breaks through the skin where it goes, and bursts out.
and is engendered by the corruption of certain humors, as are worms, serpents, and leeches and ascarides in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it travels through the body, and it ascends to the head, and it reaches the eye, perhaps it enters and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you wish to cure it and draw it out, one can only do so when it moves.
so it is necessary then that you bind the place above and below with a strong bandage tightly, then cut above and draw it out forcefully, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it, then cauterize it with fire above, until it is charred;
and the greatest harm it causes is that it damages the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, hold the eyebrow firmly below it, then cut above and pull it out forcefully;
and the patient should use cleansing remedies and dissolving medicines for the rotten bad humors, and abstain from foods that cause putrefaction.
of the pain that comes from windiness This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes to some limbs, and can move from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of her arm;
and a little later, I saw it rise as if a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quick silver when it rushes from one place to another;
the pain left that spot, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran throughout the body, until it reached the other arm;
then she told me that it was constantly moving around the body, as I saw it.
I marvelled greatly at how it moved from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this way. However, I had seen many who had pain move from one place to another, but I had never seen it like I saw in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a thin body, and exposed veins, and because of this the windiness was apparent;
and it is not apparent in the same way for those who are plump and have moist bodies and filled veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears as we have said, then quickly apply a poultice over and under it, and then cut into it until the windiness constrained to that place issues forth; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with those that dispel windiness, such as fetid pills, and pills of serapin, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they strike.
The diversity of them is that there are those that have large points, and small, and barbed, and soldered; and of those that have two angles, and of those that have tongues, and of those where there are pieces;
and the one that strikes any limb strikes in two ways: or in a principal member, like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it strikes then in any of these members, and the sign of death, which I will tell you afterwards, appears to you: so it is necessary that you abstain from the extraction of this arrow, for death comes afterwards in many situations; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then pull it out and treat the wound.
And the sign of the brain when the arrow strikes it and pierces the bone, and the skull surface that is over the brain is torn, is when there is clouding of sight and throbbing and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps there is a flow of blood from the nostrils or ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and from the wound flows white moisture resembling pus, and also like a burning of flesh;
and if these signs appear to you, then cease your treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs of an arrow lodged in the heart are that it is near the left breast, and feels as if it were lodged in something hard, and not hollow. and perhaps the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat, and fainting come. Then know without doubt that death must follow.
And the sign of an arrow that wounds the lung is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and gasps loudly and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the chest wall, it is near the ribs. and causes great pain and great distress and gasps; and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps some indigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and some straw spurts from the intestine, there is no hope for a cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts out and flows, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, shoulder joint, spine, back, arms, thighs, and legs, and similar limbs, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of his nose: I tried it, and pulled it out from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without difficulty.
And I extracted an arrow that struck him in the eye's fat under the eyelid, and the arrow was lodged, and I could only reach the tip towards the shaft, and the arrow was large, from a turquoise bow, with a light, noiseless flight;
The man was healed, and no bad accident befell him.
And I extracted an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic with wings:
I pared the flesh around it, and worked delicately until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted an arrow from a man, which had struck him in the belly, and I thought he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, he did not change his condition at all; I cut around the arrow, and extracted it, and it came out, and he had no bad outcome.
And I saw a man whose arrow had struck him in the back, and the wound was closed over it;
and the arrow remained inside him, and he did not change his natural disposition, nor did he find any harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, whom an arrow struck in his face, and the wound was closed; and remained thus without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And there was an arrow shot at a nobleman of the king, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, and was slightly tilted to the right side; and the arrow was completely lodged.
I was called to treat it after it had been lodged for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very fine probe, and felt nothing; and he felt a prick and pain below his right ear.
I thought it was from the arrowhead. I applied an attractive and digestive plaster to the spot, so that the place wouldn't swell; and the arrowhead showed itself.
and the arrowhead showed itself. I placed the plaster again, and the wound healed completely, and the patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead in his nose one day;
and he told me so. I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for several days, until it was open, and probed it, and felt the head of the arrowhead emerging from the place;
then I added more of that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrowhead appeared clearly;
and the wound healed well over four months, and then it widened so that I could put the pliers in it, and moved it from side to side, and it would not come out;
then I did not cease to devise and invent different instruments, until I took the pliers, well-made, according to what their shape will be at the end of this chapter, so that I extracted it and healed the wound.
And the doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was closed, and the patient was completely healed.
Or I have told you the quality of extracting some arrows, so that you apply your treatment to what I have not said, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but wise masters, considering a very small thing, and what is present and lacking, find new works and new instruments for the descent of strange things that occur in this art.
I say that arrows do not emerge from the limbs where they are fixed except in two ways: or through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and that which leaps out through the place where it enters, is an arrow that enters into fleshy areas, and sometimes leaps out immediately.
And if it does not leap out immediately, leave it until the flesh around it is softened, and the way out is made easier;
and if it is fixed in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it thus for a few days, and move it each day;
and then it will leap out, and if it does not, pierce the surrounding area with a very fine tool, until the area around it is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged inside the body so that it cannot be seen, then search for it throughout the entire body; and if you feel it, then remove it with an appropriate instrument;
and if you cannot because of the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there are no bones, nerves, or veins involved, then enlarge the wound;
and remove the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has prongs with which it is lodged, then cut away the flesh that is caught on either side as much as you can, and then break or bend the arrow's prongs until you can remove it;
and carefully ensure that you do not break the arrow, for that would make removal more difficult.
And if you cannot remove it in one attempt, then leave it until the surrounding tissue is rotten, then remove it, for the extraction will be easier. And if the bleeding makes you hesitant, then administer what we have said about treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can remove the arrow without danger, whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest aid possible; and if you cannot, place him according to the signs they show you.
The arrow that comes from another part, or where anything is visible from it, or the skin is swollen where it can be seen or felt apparently:
then cut above it, so that the pliers can grasp it, and then pull it out: if it leaps out now.
And if it is lodged in the bone, then rotate your hand round and round, until it enters the bone and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it for a while, and then resume pulling it out until it comes out.
and if the shaft of the arrow is stuck there, then shove the entire shaft in.
and if the shaft is broken, and you wish to administer a push, then administer a pointed instrument, so that the tip of the arrow enters the point of the instrument.
and then push forcefully, and if the arrow is pointed, then push an instrument with a pointed end into it to make the extraction easier.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as necessary.
And if the arrow is lodged in the foot or belly or bladder or side, and it is close to the surface, and you can cut over it, then cut there.
and be careful not to cut the vein and nerve, and then extract it, and then stitch the wound, if necessary. and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pliers used to remove arrows is similar to a bird's beak, and see here the shape:
And there are many kinds of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the arrowhead is also like the feather of a bird, to fit the point of the arrow, as is the shape here:
Of the veins from which one bleeds are thirty-one, of which there are sixteen in the head, that is to say: Two beating ones that are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries that are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two veins that are in the neck; and the two veins that are on the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins commonly used for bleeding are five in each arm:
One is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the common people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste", and is composed of the cephalic and basilic, and the common people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "vein of the belly", and it is above the fold, and it is the one used for bleeding, which is clearly visible above the wrist.
And the salvatelle is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is under the bend of the ankle on the left side, and the second is the saphenous vein which is at the ankle of the right side; and the vein called "nerves", which is at the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg there are three veins beneath those.
The bleeding of the veins behind the ears aids in old colds, and headaches;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you should raise the patient's head, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient should tighten their neck with a vise, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places depending from the head: Then take them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
Then take the lancet, and insert it under the vein, down to the bone, then raise your hand along the whole vein upwards, and cut through both the skin and the vein with two strokes of the knife, and make the blood come out as much as you wish;
then constrict and tie it, until it is healed;
and I have already said about incisions and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for a long-standing headache, and for a persistent eye inflammation, and for sharp pains in the eyes;
and the qualities of bleeding are as I say: and the patient should tighten their neck until the two veins are clearly visible; and feel the pulse under your finger, then bleed from the inside;
then raise the heart above the vein towards your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and raise the vein upward, and cut it, as you have done to the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then release the patient, and place your finger over the vein for an hour, then place a cotton ball over it; and then bind it firmly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for maladies of the face, and for migraines, and for inflammation;
and the method is that the patient should tighten their neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called "excavator", of which this is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press upon it with your hand, or something else, and allow blood to flow out according to the quantity you desire; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein so that it is healthy and sometimes work with a wide flame.
However, the flame should not be too sharp; and cut it across, for the bone is near, and perhaps the flame will break if it is too thin.
Cutting the two veins that are in the two tear ducts aids the eyes, and the forehead, and redness, and inflammation in the eye, and facial ailments;
and the quality of their incision is that the patient tightens their neck by twisting with a bandage, as before;
then cut it, and let the cut be across, a little length of flame, a little wide, because there is no flesh there. And if the flame is thin, perhaps it will break;
then make the blood flow, as much as you need, and then tie a bandage over it, and bind it well.
The incision of the vein at the nose is good for headaches, and for sudden madness, and for facial illnesses, such as migraines and redness that comes to the face, especially when it is old;
and the method for the incision is that the patient should pull their neck, then press their nose to your left hand, and take a thin long blade, and insert it between the lip in the space between the two nostrils, because the vein does not appear clearly there, and the blood will now begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and make the blood flow according to your need, then bandage it for a night, because it is quickly restored;
The incision of the two temples helps with constriction of the groin, and the beginning of fever, and many illnesses, and to impetigo, and to corrosions, and to herpes, and to ulcers;
And the method of the incision is that the patient should press their neck on both sides, as we have said;
And let the master be standing over the patient's head, and the patient sit on a chair, then cut the vein along a little widely, then draw the blood moderately, or as much as is necessary;
Then do the same thing in the other vein, then loosen the ligature, and moderately constrict both veins, so that the patient does not suffocate; and leave it until morning, so that the wound is healed.
of the incision of the lips The incision of the veins of the upper lips helps with phlegm in the mouth, and with the corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and throat.
And the qualities of the incision are to have the patient sit before you, and to constrict their neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look for the two veins, one on the right lip and the other on the left, which are recognized because they are black, and because around them are small black veins:
Then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and likewise do the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
Of the incision below the tongue The incision of the veins under the tongue helps after the incision of the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the eye, and for diseases of the mouth;
And the quality of the incision is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and lift their tongue, and look under on each side for a black vein:
Then cut one and the other, and do not go too deep, for the arteries are below.
The veins of the elbow, which are commonly incised, are incised according to two methods:
or in a pointed, wide flame-shaped fashion, or in a subtle, olive-shaped fashion, like sharp knives, and is called "anesil"; and are wide or subtle according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the flame-shaped incision is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And is needed to open veins filled with visible thick blood, and that contain thick and troubled blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped incision:
and is more subtle and pointed, and is for lancing thin veins, where there is thin yellow blood.
The incision of the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps ailments that are under the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is fitting for the surgeon that he lance wisely, and that he avoid the artery that is below. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then it must be stanched, as I have said; And the flame should not be pricking, but cutting, like a knife.
And if the basilica vein is not clearly visible, then you must press on it, and try another one. or you want any branch of it, or you lance in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut it with the fire knife, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the bleeding, you must first press on the arm, so that you touch the spot until you know the pulse; then mark the place with a point, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the fire knife; and beware that you do not injure the artery when you see the place inflamed, for it is of the artery: Wipe it then.
And if you see it rise upward like a child's urine, and the blood is red and subtle, know that it is blood from the artery: Hasten then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, for it often happens; then bind the arm, and leave it thus, and let the patient not move it;
and let him/her be cautious, and not move it until he/she is healthy.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overwhelms you, and the medicine is not present, then cut the artery if it is exposed, for the head will recede. and stop the blood.
And take a fig-tree bark, and split it, and take one half and bind well over it until the other day;
if the blood stops, that is good; if not, treat it, as we have said, with the powders that stop blood;
and the stopping is not difficult in many positions because of the small area of the wound, and the strength of the binding of the arm.
The bleeding of the vein in the middle helps it draw blood from the head above and the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the surgeon to be careful of the nerve underneath, and if he cuts too deep, and finds the nerve, it swells, and the patient’s healing is difficult, and perhaps cannot heal;
and this nerve is often exposed, and if it does not appear in some people due to its subtlety, then you should cauterize it with a cautery tool; and cauterize the nerve to the best of your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
The surgeon of the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and aids the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking at the olive vein or the myrtle vein, because it is the safest of all the veins, because it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, you must seek the easiest place, and do not hurt anything if you fail the first time, and you try again. And perhaps the place swells in some men, when you fail the first time, but it does no harm.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your thinking.
The first thing you should know about bleeding is that it is only administered to maintain health and avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be done in one of the three veins that are on the arm: that is to say, cephalic, facial, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear;
and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding that is administered to the sick has no set hour, but whenever necessary, by day or by night, at all hours and all times;
and it is not proper to bleed children until fourteen years of age, nor women carrying a child except from the fourth to seventh month. Nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever way, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines with a gentle clyster if they have retained much waste, so that the veins do not draw impurities from the intestines, harmful to the main limbs;
nor should one bleed those who are overly full of food, or who are drunk, as long as they are unwell, or those who are hydrops.
and one should avoid bleeding after a colic attack, vomiting, diarrhea, and increased urination in women, and after labor, or from watching or fasting, and everything that diminishes strength, whether through something of the mind or the body;
then subdues the humors, if the blood is thick, through food and drinks and medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter the bath, if nothing forbids it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein of the armpit near the third part, as we have said;
and guard yourself that day from work, and hardship, and lust, and similar things;
and be relaxed and joyful, and let the leeches be higher than the person being bled, and rub the arm two or three times, then tighten the bandage moderately, for when it is too tight or loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the area with your hands, until the veins swell and are felt;
then the leeches moisten the flame with a little old oil, then place their left hand's finger on the vein beneath the spot where they want to bleed, so the vein doesn't burst and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like cords when bled, and some that are full of wind, so that when the flame is applied, it retracts from the flame and the vein cannot be opened, and thus it is with those; and if the vein doesn't open, the wound is too narrow, therefore the leech must be careful in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that's good; if not, they start again a little below that spot or above it quickly, if the area isn't swollen.
And if the area is swollen, and the patient is frightened, they should leave it for one or two days, and do not bind the arm: perhaps a hot abscess will come.
do not enter the bath, then restart the bleeding if it pleases him.
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you fear it will not release as much blood as you want, then use fire directly on that opening itself.
and work a little hastily, before the area becomes swollen; for this happens many times when the wound is small.
If you see the area swollen, do not restart the bleeding, and put a little bit of oil on it, for it lessens the flow of blood, and the oil is gentler in this area than the lye.
and thus apply the oil to each incision that you make on the veins, to stop the flow of blood;
and this same thing makes the wound trickle and ooze when put on the area; so the blood is subtle and spreads when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess comes, which often happens, especially when the wound is not bled enough, only when the opening of the vein is small, then hurry, and apply a sponge soaked in hot water and salt to the area, and keep it there for an hour;
and it is necessary that you do this after the blood has flowed from the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains in the area after a few days, it will not harm it; and if you wish, apply something of aloes or myrrh mixed with juice of calamint, mint, or similar.
And many times an abscess and appearance happen with bleeding from the basilica.
Then place your hand on it, and if you find the area soft under the pressure of your hand, that appearance is bad. Therefore, do not apply anything of what we have said, for perhaps it flows from an artery.
But make a dry poultice to harden the area, then treat it with another remedy until it is healed.
And draw out each drop of blood according to the quantity of its virtue, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow out until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin; and if it is too hot, let it cool down.
And it is necessary for someone who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made, and the incisions be wide.
and for someone who is weak, do the opposite, and he should be bled little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this way of bleeding is safe from the outflow of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding from the long or the wide.
And for someone whose body weakens during bleeding, it is necessary to give them bread soaked in pomegranate juice; If he is feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of a cold complexion, let him eat bread soaked in syrup of honey, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and well-scented syrup, before the bleeding.
And if he faints during bleeding, after the outflow of much blood, it is necessary that he drink broth of meat, and subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the division or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wishes to lance his arm again and bleed another time, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his continuing strength.
And whoever wishes to lance his arm after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, should bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body that is already heated, and causes fever; if one must draw a large quantity, and enlarge the opening so it bleeds profusely; after you have observed all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand over his pulse when he bleeds, so that death does not occur instead of profuse bleeding, and this happens many times when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not appropriate when you wish to release the arm and make blood flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press forcefully upon it; nor if it is bent, that you extend the arm quickly, for that would be harmful;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of the flame, so that the blood that is congealed at the opening of the vein flows out freely, and place a little piece of linen moistened with water over it and press lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it, until the abscess is quieted.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, let it bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is lanced in place of the vein of the head because it is more composed.
And the method of bleeding is such that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the flesh is red.
then it is tied moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it straight through, not wide nor long;
and let the opening be wide, and let it bleed well near the joint of the hand, and if no blood can come out, then put the hand back into warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough.
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back into warm water, for one puts it more into the water in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve.
Bleeding from the vein on the right hand is good for all liver ailments, and this is the method:
Hold the hand, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; And if the blood flows sideways, and if you cut it completely through, nothing serious will happen;
And do not go too deeply, for the nerves are underneath, all bare of flesh, and then return the hand to warm water, if the blood is frozen in the wound and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and a bandage on the vein to close it quickly, and do the same for each vein.
The bleeding from the vein in the left hand is good for the disease of the mice, and do everything the same as I told you for the right.
Bleeding from the vein in the thigh is good for all diseases below the body, such as illnesses of the spleen, and retention of flowers, and diseases of the kidneys, and of the thighs and old legs, and similar illnesses.
And the method of this bleeding is that the patient puts their foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it bursts, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot, many veins go there;
So bleed then in the wider vein, or at the ankle, which is better.
And if you bleed above the foot, be careful of the nerves below, and bleed through as if cutting;
and let the flame be gentle.
And if the blood cannot come out, then place the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the lancet fails the first time, then start again a little higher, for the place is salty;
and do not fear nerves, as we have said, and thus do to the sole of the other foot likewise.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the ankle of the leg, and its lancing is worth the pain of the hip when it is for hot blood.
And the quality of its lancing is that the patient enters the bath, and tightens above the ankle with four fingers by twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, then lance it in every way you can, and across it; and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very responsive to hands.
and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very responsive to hands. And if you do not find it, then lance any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and be careful of the nerves;
and make as much blood run as you wish, and then loosen the bandage, and put on cotton and tighten it; It is now healed.
Cupping vessels are made of horns, or brass, or glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping without striking is in two ways: either with fire, or without fire;
and cupping done by striking and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, one of which is on the top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping on the two shoulders; and the cupping on the hips; and the cuppings between the two arms; and the cuppings on the two legs; and the cuppings on the two ankles;
and the cupping does not draw much blood, except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason it does not weaken one, as one does with bloodletting from a vein; and it should not be administered, neither with nor without fire, in any disease that comes from fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
And if, due to necessity for ailments, or by custom, one must use cupping, then let it be administered every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and in their neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we command them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The leeches of the temples aid the heaviness of the head... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary for this to be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of the leeching of the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary for those who are of cold complexion to use it, or who have a cold, for this does them much harm;
and therefore it is not necessary for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And those who often leech themselves become forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower due to the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of leeching of the head and the basilica vein, and therefore it is good for tightness in the chest, and for cracks in the bronchial passage, and for coughs, and for fullness.
And it must be applied gently, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness in the stomach and the heart.
Cupping on the second rib of the neck is good for headaches, eye inflammation and migraines, and for strangulation, and for toothache, and is in place of leeching of the basilica vein.
And you must instruct the patient to press his hand when applying it, so that he does not cut the artery, and there is no bleeding.
Cupping below the chin is good for mouth ailments, and for gum infections, and similar illnesses in the mouth. And it is a substitute for leeching the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illnesses that come from heat and fullness.
Cupping of the elbows is as good as cupping the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from those large veins.
And instruct the master not to strike too hard or deep, for the area is bare of flesh, and contains nerves and arteries.
A cupping vessel on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament and illnesses below, and the cupping vessel should be large and made of bronze, as it needs to draw well. And perhaps, if it were thin, it would break. And it makes large wounds.
Cupping on the legs draws blood openly, because they draw blood from the entire body, and are good for chronic pains in the kidneys, bladder, and urethra, and they draw out the impurities.
And they are in place of the two groins and the two ankles, and nevertheless they weaken the body after prolonged use, and cause weakness in several conditions.
The method of applying the cupping is to place it empty first, and to suck gently, and to place it quickly, and to move it evenly, and do not cease doing this, until you see the area red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
Then cease, and replace the cupping glasses, and be careful of the patient's condition, for there are some who have delicate skin and are easily bruised: So it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and a little deep. And suck gently.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: The first time to thin the thick blood's path.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike the third time;
And when we want to draw little by little from the blood, it suffices only once. And if we want a lot of blood, we restart often;
And if the blood is thick, strike deep, and the result is that the heart might be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those with thick, hard skin, and narrow pores, to anoint the suction cup areas with an aperitive and dissolvent oil: if it is possible, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or gourd seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the superfluities are large and cold, take amarantin oil, or balsam oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
And if the person being treated has tender skin and wide pores, no oil should be put on, but it should be washed after the suction with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or gourd water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And those who have a lot of moisture, rise from a bed of chamomile, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have large superfluities rise from old wine, or water of succory, or decoction of anise or chamomile, or other similar things;
and should not be bled with a cupping glass before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath an hour or two;
and should not sleep after the suction, and it is necessary that he wash himself when he is to be suctioned and when he has been suctioned.
And beware if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; if it is necessary that he take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces in season, and similar things; and eat pigeons, and hare meat, and moist meats.
and eat pigeons, and hare meat, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, let him take syrup of honey, and odorant wine medium, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat pigeons and small birds and doves;
and the day he will purge, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes treacle or nutmeg before the purging, or afterwards, to strengthen the main limbs; and the blood should be thinned, but it is not appropriate for those who are hot to drink it.
The cupping that is applied without striking is that which is applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the bowels and the kidneys and the hip, because those limbs do not tolerate being struck upon them, and it is not done otherwise than to draw blood from limb to limb, just as we place them on the breasts when the nipple bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, just as we apply cupping to the belly and the bowels to thin the limb;
and it relieves the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, and perhaps removes the obstruction by its attractive virtue, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and thus it acts when placed on the liver and the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cupping glasses are applied empty only to draw; and sometimes they are applied with fire, and sometimes filled with warm water, as in diseases of the pleura, and in such a manner that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping glass applied with fire is as follows:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have one small hole, like that for inserting a needle, in the side near the middle, and be of bronze, soft on the front so it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and have in the middle a crosswise rod of bronze or iron, for placing a kindled candle, and let them be large and small according to the diseases and the age of those who take them;
for the cupping glasses for children are different from those for the old, and for the thin from those for the fat.
And one should thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
Light the candle of wax or oil, and put it inside the cupping glass through the rod that is in the cupping glass, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers be over the opening that we have spoken of, so that when one wishes, the vapor will go out, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one applies the oil as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass, then, which is administered in pleurisy, acute, there is no rod or opening, and it is administered only when it is full of water, and is placed only on the limb;
and that is the form:
Leeches are administered only on limbs where one cannot place cupping glasses due to their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as the finger or the nose, and other similar ones;
and the quality of using them is that when you find leeches that are in clear, clean, sweet water without any puncture, then take them;
and place them in clear, clean, sweet water, until they are filled and have nothing in their bellies; and then let the limb be bled from a vein and cupped, then rub the limb until it is red, and place the leeches on it;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where a cupping glass can be placed, then place it, for this is very effective.
If not, then wash the place clean, and then with water, very well, and then dry it;
and if the wound heals too quickly after the leeches have been removed, then wet a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top, until the blood is drawn out;
and if the blood is excessive, then place ground vitriol, or gall, and similar things, on it until it is drawn out;
or you place half of peeled beans on the area and let them remain until they become hot on the area, this will now draw it out;
and if you need more, then take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to take hold, rub the area with fresh blood, or pierce it with a needle until blood comes out, then put them on, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will take hold;
and when you wish for them to fall off, dust a little powdered aloes and salt, or ashes, on them, and they will fall off now.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish men despise this chapter, as they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read a letter from them;
and for this reason, the science is strange in our land, for I have never found any good one;
and know nothing about it, except through the knowledge of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have mastered the science, and through experience, and by the customs of my life;
and I have now described in this chapter what is contained within, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is necessary, then, that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the words and the chapters where the wise man places his understanding, and remains upon the truth, so that those who are tested may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a break, or dislocation, or twisting, or fracture comes to anyone, you must quickly bleed the sick person on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you completely, like weakness of the body, or children, or the elderly; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold foods, that is to say, cold meats, and the flesh of birds and of roe deer, and drink no wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not overeat foods which fill the veins with blood, lest you fear a hot abscess or the spreading of matter to the limb;
if the sick person returns to his previous condition of health.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary to nourish the sick person with foods that promote growth, or that have viscosity, such as boiled wheat, and rice, and testicles, and feet, and cow's belly, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment the fracture heals more quickly and completely.
And know that broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal or knit together properly due to the dryness of the limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of young children;
but there is no cure, so reposition the broken bone, using strong bandages that support and join the limb together, until it is as strong as before; and do not completely stop working on it, and therefore it must be nourished with rich foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the arm, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there are fractures that go along the grain, and others across it, like the cut of a pen for writing.
For there are fractures that go along the grain, and others across it, like the cut of a pen for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small split.
And each manner has its own device, and its own instrument proper for restoration, according to what the recollection brings it back to its place;
And the fracture of the bone is known by the fact that the place is twisted, and clearly appears by its displacement, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
And when there is no twisting or sound upon touching, and the patient does not feel much pain, there is no fracture;
But there may well be twisting, or a split, or a small fracture. Therefore, you should not move it by hand, but apply medicines that will come later, and then hold it gently.
And know that a fracture that goes into a joint, and the two parts are separated, must now be placed evenly, lest a hot abscess arise;
and if a hot abscess arises, leave it for a day or so, until the abscess is calmed;
then put it in alignment as much as you can gently and wisely, and know that the restoration of one is gentler than the restoration of that where there are pieces;
then hold it as it should be afterwards.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and put the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you bring all the additions back to their place as much as you can, and be careful that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and properly join the two ends of the bone according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not properly set:
if you straighten it beautifully, and do not constrain it too much, nor press it as those who cause by their work a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is in place, properly restrain the patient so that they do not move it, neither when awake nor when asleep, nor when turning, nor in any other way; and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and be careful that it is placed correctly, that no twisting comes to it when it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in size and in shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar ones: so it is necessary to wrap soft and subtle linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thighs and legs:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and hard bandage, for the wide bandages embrace the whole large limb, and bind it evenly on all sides, so that there is no blemish;
then tie around light wads, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the whole bandage, then go above the fracture and tighten it less, so that the fracture then moves the fracture away slightly;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy place, then take another bandage and turn around again over the broken place;
then return to the part below the fracture, and tighten it moderately, neither too tight nor too loose, as we have said in the first bandage above;
then put linen wads or cloths between the bandages, until it is all even, then bandage it all over the bandage, and then put your well-made splints on, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then put on something soothing for abscesses that is hot and that removes the swelling, and leave it like that for several days;
then tighten over your splints, and they should be half the width of a well-cut reed, or of wood from which cleaves are made, or of palm branches, and should be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint placed over the fracture be a little larger and wider than the others;
and be also as long as is necessary for the limb's size or magnitude; then tighten over the splints as you did at the first tying, then tie over it a strong thread, as in the first tying over the fracture; tighter is above, gradually less;
and it is necessary that the thread be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, like the works of fools who make their bandages with twisted linen cords, and that is a great error, for the bandage cannot be equal if it is too thin, and it does not need to be less than the breadth of a finger between each splint.
And if the patient is wounded by the ends of the splints after tightening in healthy places, then place linen or wool wadding under them, so that he is not injured.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to splint all broken limbs on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to put splints on it sooner than after 5 or 7 days, or more, according to your certainty of a hot abscess developing.
and see here the method of ancient poultices for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists:
and it is that you take flour that stays on the mill walls, and mix it with plenty of egg, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it. This is the common method of poultice for restoring fractures in various conditions, especially for women and small children, because it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of poultice for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists: take 3 abareis and ladani and enule and asefetide and gum arabic and mugat, each 10 ounces. myrrh and aloes, each 5 ounces; alechil 8 ounces; and make it into powder, and mix it with the white of an egg; if the man's complexion is hot, then use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and restores broken bones quickly, and is good for many men.
Another type of plaster that is good for sprains: take mugwort and comfrey, each 10 ounces; myrrh and aloes, each 9 ounces; frankincense 6 ounces; Armenian bole 10 ounces, and grind well, and cook with water or egg white, and administer.
Another method of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their places, and soothes the pain arising, and the wearing out of the bone, and the fracture: Take new wool, and soak it in warm oil and cooked oil, and put it on the affected area.
These plasters do not restore, but they are good for calming a hot abscess, and properly relieve the pains.
Another method of plaster that restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of earth-wort, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another method of plaster for the restoration of a broken bone and to reduce the remaining abscess. Take root of marshmallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and vetch flour, each a part;
and grind, and bind with wine, and if the limb is hot, bind it with moist coriander water or water, and use it.
Another method of a stronger plaster than the first, when a hard abscess comes after the restoration of the limb. Take roots of marshmallow, and flaxseed, balsem, melilot, and plantain, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all an equal part; and grind, and bind with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a broken limb to restore strength except for a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a broken limb, for restoration, somewhat dry and warm things, such as myrrh and aloes and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and chopped human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and flaxseed, and grind them, and make a plaster and apply it.
And then remove it a little later, and be careful that the patient does not feel any pain, nor has the bone moved from its place; if not, do not remove it for several days. And if pain, itching, restlessness or swelling comes to the area, then hurry and remove the plaster immediately.
and take a light cloth, and a damp sea sponge, and dip it in water, and apply it to the area, until the itching stops, and the pain is relieved; then let the limb rest for an hour, then place dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bandage it for a night, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb subsides and the pain is removed, then resume the gentle bandaging and a little plaster, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and continue gently until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling have all gone away, and you need plaster and a bandage, then begin again, just as you did the first time.
And if nothing from what we have said happens to the limb, do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes leave it twenty days, depending on what is seen, until the fracture heals, and the flesh is rejoined;
then restrain it more than before, and increase its nourishment, as I said before;
and if you see the area drying more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there; therefore apply warm water frequently, every third day, and loosen the bandage a little;
by this work, then, nourishment reaches the limb, and quickly amends what foolish physicians do, who restore the limb crookedly:
This is bad, and it is a fearful practice, and I see nothing else but to leave it alone and work it correctly.
Many types of fractures exist, and various shapes, and the causes are diverse;
for there are fractures caused by the impact of a sword, and the collarbone breaks all the bone down to the area under the bone, as a mace or staff does; and for this reason this type of fracture is called "haichure".
Where the sword cuts the bone through and is pierced, and this type of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound from these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a piercing impact, or a fissure, or a blow from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a piercing fracture, which approaches the tissue beneath the bone, or it is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound that penetrates the bone as thin as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and drives a piece of bone inward, and the place is splintered just as blacksmiths do when they strike the cauldrons; if between the stones inside.
And this happens more to those who have moist bones in the head, such as a child's head;
and it happens in all these kinds of fractures that small pieces are separated, like splinters; and I will speak in its place.
And we know all kinds of fractures by the pulling on them, and the inquiry into the tents, and by the corrupt flesh on top.
The similar capillary is known by this, that when the bone has been uncovered, and one rubs against it, the black fracture is evident.
In the cure of the fracture, be mindful of the patient's accidents, and if you see any bad accident, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of understanding, and stretching, and paleness, and acute fever, and the eyes becoming bright and red, and other similar things in many conditions, then it cannot heal without a doubt.
And if you see no alarming accident, and you hope for a cure, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded person comes to you first, and it is in winter, then the bone must be removed before the fourteenth day at the latest that you can.
And if it is in summer, then hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue beneath the bone is corrupted, and the accidents we have mentioned come about.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the tissue that covers the brain, then you must split the broken part thus:
and take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way you can, and gently over the shape of the wound, and if a discharge of blood comes when uncovering the bone, or a festering abscess, then assist with what is necessary, and you must fill the space with cloths soaked in rose oil; and keep the wound at rest until the festering abscess is calmed, and be sure of the discharge of blood; then begin around the bone to remove it, and it is done according to two types of work:
One method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then put another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and are of tempered iron;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, you must pierce around it, before you administer incisions with drills, not deep enough that they pierce through the bone of the skull, and there should be a margin or a circle above the point, that does not allow the point to pass through the bone;
and you must have several, so that each one comes to its place in the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all skulls;
and this is the form of the three kinds of drills:
The quality for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place a drill on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then replace the drill elsewhere a little afterward, and do the same all around, then cut with the incisors the space of the bone that is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you extract the bone with your hand, or with any instruments that you have, such as pliers, tweezers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the surface.
And when you have pierced and extracted the bone, it is necessary that you remove the protuberance that remains of the bone with any other instrument similar to a chisel, but it should be finer and more subtle than the other chisel;
and if any small bones or any scales remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with the ointments and dressings that we have mentioned.
And the other method of work is the one that Galen said, which is safer; and the pain is very strong, and that is his word. First, you must expose a part of the bone, where the break is apparent, so that when you have exposed that part, you will place under the head of this lancet-shaped incisor, of which this is the form:
And do not cut it on one side only, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike gently with a small mallet on top, so that you cut the bone slightly all around, and be careful of the tissue that is underneath;
if it is adhering to the bone, then remove it gently, because it is removed well without harm, and without fear.
And if the break in the bone does not pierce the tissue, and the bone is cut only on the surface, and there are small pieces, then it is necessary to remove those rough edges, and remove the scales with a fine rasp of various sizes, to use the most suitable one for each place, according to the work and the shape of the break.
If using larger rasps first, and then finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well.
In each of the other cuts and subtle breaks, you must apply the appropriate remedy according to its alignment.
and this is something that is not easily explained to someone who has devoted their study to this art.
And if the surface is exposed, then you should take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound. Then take another cloth, doubled in two or three layers, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth. and do this as gently as possible so you don't strain the surface, then apply another bandage over it, and don't bind it too tightly except to just hold the wound in place;
and leave it like this for one or two days, until the inflamed abscess has calmed down, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and make a powder of these things, and put it on the wound, and apply more medicines gently without causing pain;
and watch that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave the ointment there, nor allow pus to accumulate, for when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it will spread and fester, and cause the patient great harm;
for when you put something biting on the surface, it will burn from above. Therefore, be warned, if any bad accident comes to the patient, as we have said, it is dangerous without a doubt.
And if the blackness comes only from the medicine that was applied, having such a virtue, then you must take one part of honey, and three parts of rose oil, and mix it in a cloth, and put it on the surface; then treat it with the appropriate methods of healing, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose are broken above, or one by itself, for these are two bones;
and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, but only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you should put your little finger into the nostril, and hold the broken piece against your index finger, and to the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and watch that the patient does not feel pain because of your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and your finger cannot reach the place, you must put it in line with the head of a slightly thick stick.
And if the break is of two parts, do the same again, and try to restore it on the first day, if you can;
If not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess has calmed down, then put strips of linen on the head of the nose, if the break is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the break is there. and let the strips be so thick that they fill the holes of the nose.
And some restorers say that the strips should be soaked in butter, and changed every day. It does not seem right to me, but they should be soaked in a mixture of egg white and mill powder. Then leave the strip until the bone is strong and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are placed in the nose instead of strips, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient breathes through it. Or do whatever you wish.
And if a boil appears on the nose while you are working on it, put a cerote or moistened cotton in rose oil or a bit of diachylon.
And if no boil appears, apply a plaster on the outside, made of millet flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then put on some light wool, and do not bind the nose.
And if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, remove it with instruments suitable for this, then suture the fissure, and treat it with things that join flesh, and bind, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this.
And if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead strips on it until it is healed.
When the jaw is broken from below, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only superficial, and it is not broken in two, except for slight dents inside, it is easily recognized.
If the fracture is on the right side, you should put your index finger into the patient's mouth. And if the fracture is on the left jaw, put your right index finger in, and gently push the fracture inwards with the other hand, and make it even.
And if the jaw fracture is separated into two, you must apply extension to both sides, until they are even.
And if the teeth move or break, tie them with a gold, silver, or silk thread, then apply a plaster to the broken jaw, and place a double bandage on top. and place a large, well-made splint, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed. and apply a plaster of flour from the mill, with plenty of egg or chickpea flour, after you have removed the plaster.
and place a light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster holds, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until he is healed. Many times he is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses come, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and a wound together, check if any piece of the bone has been removed. if subtle by removing with suitable instruments for that.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with fire according to your need.
And when you have removed all those pieces, and none remain, stitch the wound if it is large, and apply suitable plasters to it, to promote flesh growth until it is healed.
The forceps break many times before, towards the shoulder, and the break is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
where there is a break with a wound.
And the work is when the break is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken forceps; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then put the break in line with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor movement.
And if you need to extend further, place a round sphere of cloth or wool under the patient's shoulder, and it should be large according to your need; and extend and lift the forceps, and hold the sphere in your hand, so that you put the break in line, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the forceps out because it is deep inside, the patient must lie on his back, place a pillow underneath the shoulder, and the assistants push the shoulder down until the bone of the forceps is raised.
And then straighten the break with your fingers, and if you find it broken, you must cut open.
and pull the pieces gently, and if the bone cannot join despite any effort, cut it with one of the incisors you have. but place this instrument under the forceps to protect the surface.
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the strength of the work;
and have two heads, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the break of the wound you made when you pulled the bones;
and when you are certain of a hot abscess, cut the wound, and if the break is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, fill the wound with strips and tents, according to its quantity.
And if hot abscesses come, soak the strips in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and put it on.
The setting of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you place on the bone the plaster of mill powder and egg white, and put light bandages over it, and put a sphere under the axle, if you need it; Then take a very wide bandage, one palm wide, then put a double strip over the bandages and the plaster; Then take a thin stick, three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the head of the bandage hangs down; and place the stick over the fracture, and turn the bandage around the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the diseased armpit; and reposition it from each part, and when you see that the ligament holds the fracture in place, and you clearly see that the stick does not move from the broken bone, then observe it every day, and when the ligament loosens, then restrain it;
and have the patient lie on their back, and put a small pillow under the armpit when they sleep, to raise the shoulder up; this will relieve the fracture from the force by lifting the shoulder, or you bind the arm to the neck, and do not unbind it unless bad accidents come, up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it needs it, and restrain and leave it thus until it is restored;
and it is restored in at most twenty-eight days, and in fewer in some men.
of the fracture of the shoulder
Sometimes the shoulder breaks in a wide area or in the middle, and it is not known to be broken except by feeling it;
if you align it according to the shape of the fracture, and return it to its natural form, in all the ways you can;
then put on the area powder from the mill with abundant egg, and light wicks, and put over a double cloth; then put over a wide and thin bandage, a little larger than the shoulder, and if under the bandage there are gaps in any part of the shoulder, fill those gaps with linen wicks, so that the bandage is even;
and then bind it with a large firm bandage, so that the bandage does not move from its place, and check the bandage daily;
and every time it softens, bind it, and make the bandage even if it is off its place, and let the patient lie on their side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when these numbers are complete, unbind it, and be sure, for it is not bone that moves out of place easily.
And if a piece of bone sticks out, and is just under the skin, then pierce it, remove it, and do as we have said in the breaking of the forearm to soothe a hot abscess.
of the breaking of the breast.
The breastbone is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely. But it often breaks in the defense.
And when it is broken in the middle, it bends downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and a lack of breath, and quickly, and perhaps vomits blood, and the ends of the broken bone show, and one can feel it well.
And the treatment is that the patient lies often on their back, and places a cushion between the shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings the ribs together with your hands, and carefully aligns them in every way that you can, until the bone's shape is as it should be;
Then place plasters and bandages over the subtle, thin layer of salt, or another light substance, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and turn the bandage round the back, and tighten it gently, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs loosening, because of a corrosion or itching that comes to the area, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and treat whatever has occurred with appropriate remedies;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the broken ribs
Know that the fracture of ribs usually occurs only in the thickest parts behind the back, and at the top inside, and only break because they are brittle; and one feels it well by examination at the sides.
And the restoration is that you put the fracture in line, as is proper. And then apply a plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need one.
And if the fractured ribs are bending inward, the patient feels very great pain, and pricking, just like from a stabbing, for the bone pierces the tissue; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits up large clots of blood, and it is a serious illness, and the ancients have devoted great skill to it.
And some say that one should administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest a hot abscess appear, if it has not already. And if it has appeared, then treat it.
And some of you say that one places leeches on the area, to suck out the blood strongly, and this seems reasonable. However, there is doubt that the leeches will draw the superfluities to the area because of the weakness of the body's disposition.
And some of you say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in warm oil, and one places tents between the ribs to evenly wrap the area, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, food, and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear due to the bone piercing the flesh, and doubt exists in the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the surface.
And then one should cut the bone, and pull gently, and then sew the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes, then place cloths soaked in rose oil upon the area.
and treat the area as is appropriate for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where it is, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you wish to know if they will recover or not, watch if you see their hands softened and swollen and lifeless, and they cannot move or stretch them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it.
Know that it is mortal in many conditions, and if they move and feel well when squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is sound, and that the patient will be cured, if treatment is applied.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you wish to know if they will recover or not, watch if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are as in the hands, and on the back there is windiness and expulsion without will;
and when it is lifted onto its stomach, there is expulsion without will. And when it is lifted onto its back and it wants to sit up, it cannot. Know that it is fatal: if you do not work on its cure.
And if these accidents do not befall him, the matter is less severe.
And the treatment is that if there is a hot abscess, you should put rose oil or egg oil on it until it is soothed;
then put one of the comforting and drying plasters on it, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on that part where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then rejoin the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, and then treat it with a healing ointment, until it is healed;
and if the bone head is broken, which is called the "head of the knuckle," put the pad of your left hand there, and align it as best you can with the other hand, then apply the plaster and bandage, if you need them;
then bind it, and if there is a separated bone, split it open and remove it, and heal the wound until it is sound.
of the fracture of the hip bone
Sometimes the hip bone is fractured, and if it happens, there is not much but a little weakening at the head; and it splits lengthwise, and moves inward, and the patient experiences pain at the location, and a prickling sensation, and swelling of what is broken.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, so that you are above the fracture; and know what the fracture is and the shape of it;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then place the fracture equal so that it is in its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it moves inward, then lay the patient on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is apparent to you. And when you have placed it equal, then put on the plaster, then put on a splint of wood or of leather, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space beneath the ribs, until the limbs are even. And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess comes, then do not touch it, until the hot abscess is calmed, and put on that which we have previously said; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
of the breaking of the shoulder.
The shoulder is that which is between the blade and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, it should be restored according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie two pieces of wood to the two sides, and lift them up, and make the patient sit on a seat;
then put the broken arm on the wood, so that it reaches the armpit, and place a curved piece of wood in the middle, then lift it up with some heavy object or the assistant extends it down;
then the assistant brings the break together with his hands, until the break returns to its proper form.
And another method is to place the patient on their back, and tie the hand to their neck, then instruct two assistants that one hold the break in their hands, and the other hold under it with a single tie, and each extend to their side.
And if you wish the extraction to be stronger, then pull one tie under the break, and one above the break, and each of the assistants pull at their side.
And if the break is close to the shoulder joint, then you should place one tie under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, under the break;
and also if the break is towards the elbow, one should lightly place a tie, without effort, until the break is aligned over the joint and above the elbow;
then place the break straight as it should be, and hold it, if no swelling comes.
And if a boil arises, do not hold it tightly for seven days, and put wet wool on it with rose oil, until the boil subsides;
then hold it, and the way to hold it is to place the plaster over the break, then assemble the arm over the shoulder, and put your hand on the shoulder or on the chest;
and place the bandage, and tighten it over the shoulder and over the arm, so that the arm is in its rightful position, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone isn't dislodged.
And if you doubt that the bone is moving, then use splints, and place a splint wider and stronger than the others over the break, and have one inch of space between each splint, and each splint should be so large that it extends three inches beyond the break on each side.
then tighten over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter regarding the break, more strongly and less as they are pulled further away.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, in the time you restore the broken limb, and you suspect a hot abscess, leave it to heal until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check every three days the bandage, that itching or swelling do not appear in the place, or that the nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If it heals, as we have said.
And if no such accident comes to it, do not loosen it until after three days or more, and let the sick person sleep on their back, and have their hands on their stomach;
and place a pillow of wool beneath the shoulder, and watch every hour of the day or night that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bindings do not soften;
if it heals by the power of medicine, and give it the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a manner that the food be first subtle; and when it begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be recovered in forty days altogether; and then one should loosen it and administer baths and ointments for the place to be straightened.
And if the constriction is ugly and inflamed, it remains to be loosened for ten days or two months.
of the breaking of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "fossiles," of which one is small, and is the one that supports the thumb;
and the other is large, and is the one that is underneath, towards the small finger;
perhaps the large fossile is broken only, or the small one, and perhaps both together.
When the small fossile is broken, the restoration is light, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, so is the healing bad, and more serious than when they are broken both together.
If it is the small fossile that is broken only, then it must be slightly stretched lightly, and put equal.
And if it is the large fossile, then it must be squeezed more strongly;
and stretch it on a cushion, and keep the thumb of the hand higher than the others, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient does not suffer any labor;
then the minister extends his arm to the part below his hand, or to a link, and another minister to the other above.
And then the mirror should put it equal, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, then place each one in its place, and if there is any detached one that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut through it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in the separate chapter; so take the cure.
And if in the beginning of the restoration there come hot abscesses, then apply a plaster of cerote made of rose oil and white wax, that it be neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the plaster gently, until the hot abscess is soothed.
And then remove the plaster, and put on a poultice of mill powder with abundance of egg, then put on the splints, and let the splint for the fracture be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints or more in various positions: whether the fracture be in one bone, or in two;
and hold tighter on the fracture than elsewhere, and gradually less as it moves away, just as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread with which it is bound be linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the bandage after several days. And if any bad accident comes to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must wash the limb with hot water, until that itching is calmed;
and let the limb rest not too tightly bound.
And then resume the binding, and if the bandage is softened and the bone separated, or something similar, then adjust it.
And be careful that nourishment cannot come to the limb because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it so for several days, until nourishment runs there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not unbind it for twenty days.
or, in the neck area, then support the hands to the neck, and let his neck be still, and guard against movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is restored in 30 or 35 days, and perhaps in 20 days, according to the compositions and complexions of the virtues.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and on the sides of the fingers, there are few fractures, and there are often only bends.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, the patient should sit cross-legged, and sit straight ahead of him evenly;
then place his hand on the outstretched surface, and the minister stretches the broken bones and places them evenly, until they are well joined;
and applies the plaster and bandages, if no abscess develops, then places a splint according to the size of the area; and be wrapped in a linen bandage.
And if the fracture is within the area around the sole of the foot, make a sphere of bandages, and instruct the patient to press it against their fractured foot; and then bind it with a long bandage, and the splint should be of soft wood as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as appropriate.
And if the fracture is in the upper part, you should place a splint above and another below on the sole, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and bind tightly between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs at any of the joints of the fingers, if it is the knuckle, align it evenly, as appropriate; and bind it with the palm, and if you want, place a small straight splint to raise the fracture and prevent it from moving;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the index or one of the others, align it and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or you bind them all together in a row, in whichever way is best, or you put a splint on it, as in the knuckle;
and be careful in the restoration and arrangement of a hot abscess, and support what comes from it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and it is clearly seen when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is done by tying a bandage above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on their face, then each minister stretches their bandage equally on their side;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, then one bandage should be towards the groin, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And also if it is close to the knee, then the bandage should be beside the knee, and the extension should be downwards;
then the surgeon should place the bone straight with his two hands, until it is according to its natural shape, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscess occurs there.
And if there is a hot abscess, allow it to subside then return to your work and your treatment; The treatment is done in this manner.
It is necessary that you wrap over the fracture one hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and put one long thread between the thigh and the leg, below the knee, and the thread's end comes above;
then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to make the tightness equal, then begin to tie firmly three or four turns over the fracture; and the higher you go over the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then tie the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie three splints that are above it, then go back below to the end of the thread, until you reach the foot;
and tighten it, so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like this, so that no abscess or swelling or other similar thing comes. And if it happens, then untie it, and address whatever comes, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that prick, then it needs to be removed, if possible; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to split the place, and draw out force; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken in this way, so that splints are placed in it, as in the shoulder and in the arm;
However, with such a restoration, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in ten days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversity of complexions.
Know that in the joint of the knee, there is little fracture, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and it happens in any wound, and without a wound, and this one senses well.
And the restoration is that one puts equal those things that are broken into their place, as much as they can be assembled.
Then put the plaster, and put a round splint, if you need it, and bind it as necessary, then look after all the arrangements we have mentioned in other fractures, as in a hot abscess and other similar things; So apply to each accident what is needed, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is called by right name "tibia", and the other is called "fibula";
and there is every type of fracture as there is in the arm, and for this the restoration is just like that of the arm, and the work is all the same.  And if the two bones are broken together, the leg twists in all directions.
And if the slender bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one sees it clearly; and it turns downward.
Then administer extension, and put it straight, and bind the splints evenly;
but nevertheless, if the fracture is severe, and there are many pieces, the extension should be less and more gentle; and treat it according to your skill.
And when you have completed all your work, take two sheaves of wooden splints that will support the leg on either side, and be the length of the leg from the knee down;
then wrap it in two places with one bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg will not deviate to the right or to the left, and thus it is well;
and some apply a splint the length of the leg, made of wood, and place the leg on it to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture or where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other accident; if cure it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but to the bones of the foot there is sometimes fracture, and to the toes too, and there is no force there except breakage in several positions.
And if there is a fracture to the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overriding one another, put the patient's foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their place;
then put the plaster and bandages on, and put under the sole of the foot a small plank two inches wide, then bind it tightly to the foot, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, unbind the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them, as we have said for the toes of the hand; then put on the broken toe a splint the length of the toe, and slightly wider, then place the plank I mentioned under the foot and bind it tightly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, put a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in one linen bandage, and bind the plank under the foot; and let it extend above the head of the plank to protect the sole of the foot, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things I have said about other fractures, as we have already said; and treat each accident as appropriate.
of the fracture of the bone of the knuckle
When the bone in a woman's nature is broken, make her sit with her legs spread, then incline her toward her back, and let her be held from behind;
then let the attendant fill the patient's natural cavity with cotton, and put in as much as it will hold;
then straighten the woman, and lift her back gradually, and then the cotton will spring out, until it reaches the entrance of the natural passage, and the bone returns with the cotton;
and when she wishes to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back in, and do this for seven days or thereabouts: so the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a string to the opening, and put the entire bladder into the natural passage; then blow into the string forcefully, until the bladder is inflated inside: the natural passage will restore the fracture;
then fill it with cotton, and leave it like this for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's finger is broken, or a woman's, restore it like we said for the bone of the hip;
and these fractures close at hand are not hidden from those who apply themselves to their study and usage, and understand my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the correct path of restoration: Understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and apply it to the penis; then wrap bandages around it, and leave it for three days or more, and it will be healthy quickly.
of fracture with wound
It is necessary for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that they be bled immediately, as the bleedings we have described demonstrate.
And if the wound bleeds, stop the bleeding with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin to restore the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if a hot abscess does not come.
And if a hot abscess comes, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess is calmed, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would bring a bad accident.
And if the broken bone is visible on the uncovered flesh, it is necessary that you put it in place gently with your hands, with a small extension.
And if the extension is not suitable for placing it straight with your hands, then reset it with this iron instrument, which has seven or eight fingers in length, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, the surgeon needs three or four, according to what he needs for each fracture treatment;
and let it be round and slightly thick, so that it does not bend at all when compressing the limb in your work, and be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called "palanche", so that the bent stick must be placed on the head of the visible bone; and push it at once, so that it returns, and let them be even against each other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot properly grasp the bone, you must cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot return the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument for this, whether a cutter or saw, to the best of your ability;
then remove what remains of harshness and small bark from the bone.
And when the bone is returned, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
So do so until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and properly if it is in a state; and do not put a plaster or anything else with oil on the wound, lest it cause rot and corruption;
then apply splints after you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and be careful that the wound is not constricted by the fracture;
and many times foolish doctors have done this, and have brought death or corrosion upon the patient; and the constriction should be softer and gentler than in other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad accidents will come to it, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, you should not put splints on it; but wrap around it, instead of splints, hard cloths, and tie them.
And when you see after one or two days a boil forming on the wound, remove what you have put on it completely, and apply a healing ointment for wounds, such as a four-herb ointment and similar ones.
And you must untie the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And the limb must be arranged in such a way that the boil runs down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but returns to a boil, know that there are small pieces of bone, therefore you must probe the wound with a probe, and remove all those detached pieces causing that pain.
And if a fistula forms at the site, or another kind of corruption, then you must treat it, according to what he says in his chapter before.
And when the bone is broken, and exposed on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and other similar large limbs, do not pull it out, for often death results, but leave it until it rots.
Perhaps it will fall away by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can.
and if you cannot, then leave it.
Boils often come after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and the appearance of the limb is a pitiful sight. and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care therefore if it is fresh. if he administers styptic medicines, such as aloes, frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with plenty of egg white or with vinegar; and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for many days;
and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for many days; and then remove it, and start another, until the swelling is removed;
or you bind over a piece of lead well made; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the swelling has already hardened like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut over it and remove the excess apparent swelling; or you scrape it with a razor until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after the healing
When the broken bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and frail afterward, this happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of a multitude of irrigations; or because of too great movements, and not at the proper time; or because there is little blood in his body, so he is weak.
And the cure is that you make the sick person eat, and make the body tender, so that the blood is multiplied within him; and administer baths, and give him joy and ease;
then put poultices on the limb, so that the poultices attract great nourishment, and frequently water it with warm water, so that the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural shape.
of a limb twisted after the sickness When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the limb's shape is ugly, nonetheless it does not lose its natural function:
so do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb again, and many foolish men have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
However, if the knots and the torments are fresh, they must be soothed with hot water, or softened herbs boiled, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with goose fat or sesame oil, and make a poultice on top;
or take ripe figs, and crush them with fine flax, and similar medicines that lessen the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with moist hands. And movement should be administered to the limb every hour.
And if the twisting is aged and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it should be cut to the bone, with a sharp, light incision. and apply compresses and study the cure.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, so that it cannot move, and the limb is misaligned, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When dislocation occurs to someone, it must be immediately returned without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it is difficult to return it to its place.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to move it when it is swollen: Many times it causes inflammation and other pains;
However, when this happens, let the patient be bled, then leave it until the inflammation is calmed;
then apply warm water and oil to the limb, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as it comes back into its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head down to the feet.
Sometimes the jaws are dislocated on both sides, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways: where they are a little dislodged from their places, and softened a little; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and saliva flows from the mouth so that he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and wraps his tongue with the speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by several arrangements.
And if it is complete and accomplished, you must reset it quickly, and do not delay.
and in such a manner that the attendant holds the patient's head, and places the tip of one of his hands in the root of the dislocation of the jaw inside the mouth, if the dislocation is of two parts; and the other finger of the hand should be outside, to put it straight;
and instruct the patient to relax their jaw, and move it in all directions. And the attendant straightens it until it returns to its place.
And if the repositioning is difficult, especially if it is the two jaws together, then soothe them with warm water and oil, until they are easily repositioned;
and do not delay the repositioning, as we have said.
And when they are repositioned correctly, and the patient's mouth closes well without difficulty, then apply wet cloths in a bandage made of rose oil and wax, then lightly bind it with soft strips.
and let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right or left, nor make any effort to move, but take light food, until the pain is gone, and the jaws are healed.
and then let them eat whatever they want lightly, and do not try to open their mouth for eating and drinking, until the jaw is well healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be put in place at once, and are not returned to their proper positions, fever and persistent aches result, and perhaps looseness of the bowels, and perhaps vomiting of clear phlegm.
And when you see this, then know that it is death. and many times those who experience this die within four days.
The fork cannot dislocate from the inside of the ribs and the breast, and is sometimes dislocated outward, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is such that the patient often lies on their back, and extends their arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tightly;
and the shoulder that is next to the ribs cannot dislocate; if not, and if it dislocates at any time, reset it to its place, as we have said;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and in the same way is the shoulder reset, when it is removed from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways:
of which one is that it dislocates at the part of the socket below; and the second is at the part of the breast; and perhaps dislocates at the part above, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind due to the shoulder, and it does not dislocate inside due to the nerves;
and many times it dislocates below toward the socket, especially in those who have little flesh, for in those it leaps quickly;
in those who have enough flesh, it leaps with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And perhaps in some men there is a blow or a fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated by this.
Therefore, you must try it, until you are certain. and then begin the treatment.
And dislocation is known when it is down toward the armpit, and puts a difference between the sick shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a manifest difference between them. and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone. and the patient cannot bring his hand to his side, nor move it in any way.
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it manifestly when touching.
and this kind of dislocation is only to be reset, when it is new, or if the child is sick.
And the method is that the minister lifts the patient's hand upward, then places his palms under the armpit, and lifts the joint forcefully upward to its place. And the minister lifts the hand, and extends it upwards, then places it underneath. Thus it will quickly come.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then the patient must be bathed in hot water; and the minister apply a softening and soothing lotion, such as a decoction of marsh-mallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and be administered;
then the patient is to be laid on their back, and a bed of even wool, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed beneath the armpit; then the patient places their heel on the bed; lift the head of the shoulder forcefully, and pull the patient's hand;
and another minister should hold the patient's head so that it does not move down; that shoulder returns immediately, and if you wish to reset it in this manner:
and it is that you should have a man present who is taller than the patient; and stand straight towards the side, and place his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and raise the armpit upwards so that the patient hangs in the air; and another minister pulls the patient's hand down towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, then hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reset in another way:
and there is a long ember placed in the ground, whose head is as round as a pestle, and is neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but let him have soft cloths over, and the patient be positioned on the length of the stick;
then his hand is extended downwards on the other side forcefully, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return despite all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a stick of two arms of great and four fingers in width, which has a round head for it to enter deep under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths over the head of the stick, so the stick does not hurt the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm to the top of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of width, and let the hand be extended downwards, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint returns into place now.
And when it is in place, however it may be, you must put a layer of wool under the armpit, then place the prepared plaster of ground powder, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then bind it under the armpit tightly, and wrap the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to the neck, and let the hand remain like this.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after 5 or 7 days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come to it, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries to three holes, as it is shown in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and cannot raise the arm, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder is cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations toward the breast, or the back, are caused by the pushing and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered.
and treat until they are healed.
And if after healing, there comes cracking in the limb, and delay in movement, then the patient should use baths many times, until the cracking is relieved and it returns to its original condition.
Of the dislocation of the rib.
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated in spurts, and returns in spurts.
and if it is dislocated from all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not cured, for it is clearly visible and felt. and dislocates according to each shape. And when you join the sick rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is bent, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder at all.
And it is necessary to reset it before a hot abscess comes, for if a hot abscess came, it would be difficult to reset it.
and perhaps it cannot be completely reset, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps death comes.
And the restoration, when it is such that it can be reset, is that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms be spread out, and the hands of the mirror according to the blade around, above and below, and push the joint to his shoulders together, or to the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes from the root of the palm with the blade that is dislocated.
And if it does not wish to return to its place, then administer strong extension;
and it is that two ministers extend the arm, and hold it two ministers, so that it does not move with the extension;
then turn the arm each way, after you have wrapped a double cloth long and wide;
and when the minister has joined the joint to his hand, then anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint strongly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, then put a dry plaster over it with a bit of egg, and bind it tightly, and hang the arm at the neck of the patient, and leave it for a few days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then unbind the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint is not firmly set, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it thus for a few days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the joint has been reset, and it moves, then bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or you place a thick layer of fat lamb's wool on the joint, then leave it for one day and one night, then remove it, and put it in a bath; and when it sweats, gently rub the joint, then put the wool back on, and then put it back in the bath; and do this two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, place warm, moist cow's hair mixed with butter on top, and bind it on;
it will return to its position.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is lighter than other joints. However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the very moment it dislocates, before the place swells or a hot abscess appears there.
And the returning is done by placing the ill hand upon a table, and the minister extends the hand, and the minister places it straight, so that he puts his palm upon the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, you must observe if it is correctly in place; Then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table for extension and returning. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, the patient should place the back of their hand on the table, and the minister should place their hand over that appearance of the joint.
If it returns now, that is good. If not, apply soothing poultices to the abscesses, and leave it like that without restarting.
And if he cannot tolerate it, and you cannot put it in place after a few days, the joint remains crooked.
and it does not harm the patient any further than the hand is softened and cannot grip anything at all: then know that the nerve or artery are severed;
there is no other remedy except to cauterize it near the wound, and perhaps nothing else will work.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days, then unwrap it and leave it like that.
And if it cannot move well, and there is some stiffness, then soak it in hot water and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or the front.
Then straighten the finger and push the dislocation back into place with your fingers until it returns, then support the head of the finger and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then put it straight on that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it again at night;
and do this often, until it is straight, and do likewise if it is dislocated on the front of the hand, and do as you did before, until it is healed;
and do likewise, when it is dislocated on the other side.
Concerning dislocation of the shin from the back
When the shin from the back or from the neck is dislocated, or if there are many dislocated, there is no cure, for death hastens the patient.
And the signs are that the excretions jump out involuntarily, nor can he contain them, and many times certain limbs are softened, or the two thighs or the two arms or one.
And many times the shin moves to four parts;
that which moves to the back is called "gilbositez":
the cure is that you watch if the gilbositez came from childhood: if there is no cure nor healing at all.
And that which comes from falling or impacts or similar things, the old ways of cures were spoken of in great words, where there is not always much profit;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gilbositez that comes to the breast, there is no remedy nor health;
and also that which comes directly to the two sides, and one cannot cure other than that which comes to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be laid out on his face in a level place, and have something soft beneath him so that he does not injure himself;
then place a piece of wood at the head in the earth firmly, and another at the feet, and tie a bandage under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants should hold the bandages, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two pieces of wood;
and they should be firmly fixed, the pieces of wood as we have said, and the physician should place his palms firmly on the spine, until it returns to its place.
And if it does not return with this treatment, take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient be on his side, and place the head of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with the turner that turns in the hand. And you should place two pieces of wood at the head of the sick person, one arm's length away, and two others towards the feet, and have one palm's width of space between each piece of wood, above and below;
and have one hole in each piece of wood, where the turner runs, and let the pieces of wood be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move;
and between each two pieces of wood, have one rotating piece of wood, upon which the cords turn, and have two small pieces of wood, one palm's length, to turn the turner;
and then tie the cord that is among the knots to the turner towards the head, and the other cord towards the feet to the other turner, and each of the ministers turns their turner to the whole cord, and the master puts the splinter evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, put a desiccated plaster with plenty of egg, and then the bandages, and then a strip of a tablet three fingers long, that embraces the area of the protrusion and the healthy part of the spine, then bind it with a cord, as we have said, and the patient should use a subtle nourishment until he is healed;
And if any problem arises at the end of the healing process, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the strip we have previously mentioned; and sometimes a piece of lead is administered, and sometimes an appearance arises in the back spine of the back, and it is thought that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone that appears, for which one should not have any presumption: perhaps it would cause death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations occur, and nothing else, unlike the other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward elsewhere, and slightly dislocated forward and backward.
And the knowledge of its inward dislocation is that when you join the sick leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the sick person's knee appears more prominent than the healthy one, and the sick person cannot bend their knee at the fire; and the place beside is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of one upon whom it comes outward is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the signs of the one upon whom it happens in front are that they extend their leg well according to its completion; However, they do not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make it go, it cannot go forward, and they retain their urine, and their groin swells, and when they walk, they step on their heel.
And the signs of the one upon whom it happens behind are that they cannot extend or bend their knee, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is ancient, and it remains according to its condition, in which case there is no cure; and no presumption should be made in this case.
And in the case where the dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four types of dislocation, be quick to turn the joint, and push it inside and out, and move it to the right and left; Perhaps it will return, and no other treatment is needed.
And if it does not return in this way, you must prepare a strong instrument, and pull the leg firmly with two hands, or with a rope tied above the knee; and another assistant should place their hand above in such a manner that they place their hands under their armpits, and then tighten it with a gentle rope above the thigh; and another person should hold the end of the rope;
and all of them pull upwards and downwards at the same time, so that the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to four similar cases, and if the dislocation is returned, as we have said, it is good.
If not, one must apply treatment to its likeness.
When the dislocation is inside, you should place the patient on their healthy side, then put the bandage on the root of the thigh, and the area under the armpit, then pull the bandage upwards towards the armpit and towards the collarbone;
then take another assistant and hold the thick area of the injured thigh, and stretch it outwards strongly. it will return to its place now;
and this type of dislocation is less severe than the others.
And if you cannot reposition it in this way we have described, you must tie the patient's two feet together with a strong soft bandage around the two heels, and around the two knees, and the injured leg should be extended two spans more than the other;
then be suspended from the top of a post, and be two arms' length above the ground;
then instruct one attendant to grasp the head of the thigh, and let another attendant hang with the patient, who tightly grasps the thigh, for the joint will now quickly return.
And when the dislocation is at the hip, let the patient lie as we have said for those with hip problems, and apply a bandage to the affected leg, and also to the hip;
then place two pieces of wood, one at the head and one at the feet, and place a piece of wood between the patient's thighs in the middle. and have damp cloths placed around, so as not to harm the patient, then let each attendant lean towards him, and the one observing place the dislocation equally at his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place him on a table, and press him as we have said for those with hip problems, and let the patient lie on his sound side.
And when the dislocation is in front, the affected leg must be extended quickly, and in accordance with what I have said. And let the observer put effort on the affected joint, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is at the back, the patient should not be extended downwards, nor lifted from the ground, but should be positioned as if the hip were dislocated at the back, as we have said for the lying position on both hips. and let him lie on his face, and the bandage is extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint against the table; and it will be correct when the patient straightens his legs, and they are even. Then, join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and let him rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and put the plaster back on;
and if you see that they are even, bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and let the limb heal gently, until the limb is strong.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend their leg at the thigh, and if it does not align with their thigh, know that it is dislocated;
And the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and place your back against their face, and place their foot on your feet;
then take their knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee firmly; and another attendant extend their foot, so that the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that they align their leg with their thigh slightly;
and place the plaster on it, and have the leg aligned with the thigh, and bind them together firmly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and the patient does not work or walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not fully healed, the attendant should apply strong stretching, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healthy.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes dislodged, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inward and outward.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and extends forward towards the part where it is dislocated:
The reduction is gentle, and it should be gently extended by hand when it is merely dislodged.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and have two attendants hold firmly on the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and place the foot neatly upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
if it returns, that is good;
if not, then begin the work again, because it returns;
and if it cannot return thus, then make the sick person lie on their back on the ground, and firmly place one stake in the ground between their thighs, and tie cloths around it so that it does not injure the sick person;
then let the attendants hold the thigh, and other attendants extend the foot to their hands or to a rope, which they tie above the ankle of the foot; then let each attendant stretch equally, and the stake should be between the sick person's thighs to hold the sick person when they are being stretched;
then let the attendant place the dislocation in their hands, and another attendant hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then put the plaster and bandages on, and bind it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves that are on the ankle behind, that the bandage is not too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage softens, tighten it;
then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if pus comes to the boil, you must relieve it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently stretched without force, and this is an easy task.
And if the dislocation is in any part of the back of the foot, you must have the patient sit on a flat surface or a table, sitting upright, and place your foot on the exposed joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns.
And when it is aligned, and nothing is visible, place a board under the sole of the foot, with two supports, then hold it firmly, and leave it for three days, then release it. and keep it resting until it is healed.
of wounds and dislocations together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
Therefore, do not be presumptuous in the treatment if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and patient, and not hasty.
and use soothing things at the beginning for a hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands if you see no hope of health. And when you see hope, then return the limb to its place, before the hot abscess comes to it.
And when the limb is in place, administer soothing things for the hot abscess, and treat the wound, as is appropriate, with drying ointments.
And if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then set them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses.
And guard yourself from entering into a state of fear, according to what I have said, for this will be beneficial to you according to your Creator, and for the safety of your body and soul.
