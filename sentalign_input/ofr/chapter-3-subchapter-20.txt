of burns that come upon a burn scar/scab
We often see, after the healing of a fracture, especially when it is near a joint, an ugly thing to see, the shape of the limb;
and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Therefore, take care if the knot is fresh:
then administer styptic medicines, such as aloe, frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar;
and put them on the knot at night in compresses, and tighten it well, and do not loosen it for many days;
and then undo it, and start another one, until the nodule is removed;
or you tighten over it a well-made piece of lead;
for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the nodule has already turned into a hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut over it, and incise the apparent excess;
or you scrape it with a scraper, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
