of the water of the eyes
When water first comes to the eyes, by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and protect him from all moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times while fasting.
Afterward, have him shave the back of his head, and make a cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the flow of water is in both eyes, or one if the flow is in one; and with the cautery burn all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple; and beware of excessive bleeding, and if you see too much blood coming out, staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the precaution of how you will staunch it; and sometimes one makes a cautery or cauterization below the two bones behind.
