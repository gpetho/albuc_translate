Chapter fifty on cauterizing cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around it as it rotates.
Some physicians have mentioned that it should be cauterized with a deep cautery in its center, but I do not see that because I expect it to ulcerate.
And I have witnessed that several times.
So the correct way is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said, or with many cauterizations.
