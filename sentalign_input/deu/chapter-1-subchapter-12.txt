Chapter Twelve:
On the Cauterization for Water Falling into the Eye.
When the onset of water in the eye is identified by the signs mentioned in the division, begin by giving the patient something to cleanse their head and avoid all humid substances.
Make them sweat in a steam bath for several days.
Then shave their head and cauterize the middle of the head. Additionally, cauterize the two temples if water is affecting both eyes, or one side if only one eye is affected.
Incise with the cautery all veins and arteries beneath the skin. The cauteries should be long and lateral on the temples.
Be careful to prevent bleeding when cauterizing; if bleeding occurs, stop it with any possible medicine.
I will provide further guidance on the extraction and excision of arteries and controlling bleeding.
Sometimes, cauterization is done on the neck below the two bones with two subsequent cauteries.
