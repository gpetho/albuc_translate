Chapter fifty-two on cauterizing the corroding ulcer.
The corroding ulcer is but a corruption that spreads in the organ, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see the corroding ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, heat many nail-shaped cauteries, small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the corroding ulcer is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains at all.
Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
If, after three days, you see that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, then [it is fine]; otherwise, repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas.
The corroding ulcer can also be treated with a potent medication, as it acts as a quicker substitute for fire.
I have mentioned its treatment with the potent medication in the classification, so take it from there whenever you need it.
