of the limb that is weak after healing	On the treatment of a fracture when, after repair, the limb remains unnaturally thin.	0.4784178
When the fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and thin, it happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of excessive watering/irrigation; or because of too much movement, not at the right time; or because there is little blood in the body, so it is weak.	When a fractured bone has been repaired but the limb remains thin and weak, this may be due to many causes: the bandaging being too often loosened and not properly tightened; or excessive binding-up so that nourishment cannot flow to the limb; or excessive fomenting; or excessive and premature movement; or the thinness and weakness of the patient's blood.	0.8840046
And the treatment is that you make the patient eat, and make the body soft, so that the blood is multiplied in him; and administer a bath, and give him joy and happiness; then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch attracts great nourishment to it, and water it often with warm water, so that the nourishment flows to the limb; and it returns to its natural shape.	The treatment of this consists in the nourishing and restoring of his body so there be plenty of blood; and the use of the bath; and cheering the patient and making him happy, and so on. Then apply pitch to the limb so that it may draw much nourishment to itself, or continue the massage to the limb with tepid water, so that nourishment flows in the limb and it returns to its normal shape.	0.8911668
