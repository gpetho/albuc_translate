Praefatio.	Premise.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed to you, my son, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its supplement, and I have finished in it from its expositions and its declarations, it has seemed to me that I complete it to you with this treatise which is a part of surgery, that is, chirurgical manual.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Because the operation with the hand is laid out in our region, and in our time it is private at all times: until perhaps the science of it has perished, and the trace of it has been lost: and there remained from it only a few descriptions in ancient books, which hands have changed: and it happened to them error and hesitation, until their intentions were closed, and its vision was extended. It has seemed to me that I can make it clear with this order of this treatise in it according to its exposition, declaration, and abbreviation: and that I can bring it into being with the forms of tools cautery, and the rest of the instruments of work: for the sake of adding a declaration, and properly establishing what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why there is not found a good workman of his hand in our time, is because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to be exercised in the science of anatomy which Galen narrated, until he knows the joints of the limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has a knowledge of bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and their emergence, and beating pulses, and quiet, and places of exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for this reason Hippocrates said, that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	But we have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Because he who is not aware of what we have said about anatomy, does not clear up, but falls into error, which are produced by the humans: as I saw many of them who formed themselves out of this science, and cast themselves down upon it without knowledge, and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What is, for I saw a dull physician cut an aposteme scrofulous wound on the neck of a woman, and he wounded some arteries in her neck: why did the blood flow from the woman until she died between her hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a man, which had lodged in his body for many years, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he came to him, and extracted it with a twig of holly.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why did the man die on the third day?
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I too had been called to extract it: and I saw from the great size of the stone, and the care of the nurse, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician, who was taking a fee from some Duke of our land for his medicine: and there happened to be with him a black eunuch, who was by his side, and broke his thigh bone near the heel: and the physician went on, through his ignorance, and bound up the fracture on the knee with strong bandages, and did not cease from his operation.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he dismissed him after a few days, and he commanded that the ligaments should not be loosened: and so it stood until his leg was broken at the knee, and his ankle, and he came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called to him: and I set about loosing the ligaments: and there resulted peace, and he was free from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However the corruption had already taken hold in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So the corruption ceased to wander in the limb, until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who pierced an aposteme cancerous wound: and it became a ulcer after a few days, until the malignancy of it was manifest to his lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, for when it is a cancer pure from the melancholic humor, then it should not be cut with iron at all unless it be in a member which can bear it, that it may be completely cut off from it.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that reason, my sons, it is necessary that you know that surgery is divided into two parts: namely, the operation which is associated with health, and the operation where there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already excited in every place of this book, where came the operation, where there is fear and fright.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to decrease it: so that you may not find stupid speech when you speak, and dishonorable.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore receive with carefulness and protection, and give your patients with ease and strength, and use a better path leading to the grace of God for salvation and worthy succession: and remove from you terrible diseases with difficult healing: and take away your souls from there, which makes you fear, so that it may come upon you hesitancy in our faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For this remains more remaining to our glory, and higher in the world so that afterwards to the quantities of you.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his advice.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not call disease a bad one: do not name the doctor as bad.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have already divided this Treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One:
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Chapter One: On the cautery with fire, and on the cautery with acute medicine, fresh, and arranged from the head to the feet, and on the shapes of instruments, and tools for cauterizing: and everything that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two:
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Chapter Two: On the cutting and piercing, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds: and on the extraction of arrows, and things like them: and all the Treatise, arranged in the shapes of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three:
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On the restoration, and dislocation, and cure of torsion, and things like them: Treatise divided into three chapters, arranged from the head to the feet, and in the shapes of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Liber Chirurgice Albucasi.
Pars I.	I, 1. The art of surgery is twofold, practical and theoretical. The practical concerns what must be done; the theoretical, why it must be done. Thus one should not only study the art in order to practice it, but also understand its principles. Consequently, knowledge without experience is incomplete, and experience without knowledge is dangerous. There are two kinds of surgery: that which deals with the body as a whole, and that which concerns separate parts. The former is called general surgery, the latter, special or local surgery. Under the first heading come such operations as amputation, ablation, resection, ligation, and puncturing; under the second, those concerned with specific organs, such as the eye, ear, nose, throat, breast, groin, anus, and genitals. Among these last are included the various kinds of cataplasm and poultice, as well as the treatment of wounds and ulcers.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	I, 2. In respect to cauterization and incisions, it is necessary to know which parts of the body require them, and at what time; also, whether they are to be made with iron or gold.
Caput I.	I, 3. The first principle in surgery is to know the nature of the flesh, and the causes that bring it to disease. The nature of the flesh is fourfold: blood, nerve, fat, and bone. These are its basic elements, but it also has other ingredients, such as muscle, sinew, lymph, and serous fluid. Blood gives life to all parts of the body; it is the most vital part, and without it death ensues. Nerve controls all the functions of the body: therefore, whatever affects it must be carefully considered. Fat contributes to the nourishment of all the parts, and so does bone, which also gives support and protection. Muscle performs various movements; sinew binds together the bones; lymph circulates through the vessels, carrying food to the parts, and taking away their waste products; serous fluid fills the cavities and spaces, maintaining the balance of the body's fluids.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I proceed to speak of the different kinds of operations, it is necessary that I should explain the qualities of cauterization and incisions, and at what sort of parts they are to be applied.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I therefore say that the speech concerning the quality of cauterization and the operation is long, intricate, profound, and full of secrets and mysteries.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	A multitude of wise men also spoke therein, and disagreed among themselves; but for me a little from their words is sufficient, I am afraid of protraction.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I therefore say that cauterization applies to all kinds of tissue, whether it be with or without substance; I except two kinds of tissue, which are hot and dry without substance, and dry without substance.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In the hot and dry complexions with substance there was a difference:
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some said that cauterization is applied to the warm and dry complexions with substance.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of him, namely that cauterization is not suited in a disease that is from heat and dryness: for nature's quality is heat; and it is not suitable, so as to heal from a hot and dry disease, when it is hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who speaks contrary to him said: That by means of cauterization a remedy is made for all hot and dry disease that happens in human bodies: because when you compare the human body, and its humidities, with the complexion of fire, you cool the human body.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself also say by my speech: because from experience I have already found that.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not necessary that you should argue about that, unless he who has already been proven and exercised in the exercise of the last chapter of cauterization, and knows the difference between the complexions of men, and the disposition of diseases in himself, and the causes thereof, and the accidents thereof, and the space of time thereof.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the rest of the complexions there is no fear for you; and above all in cold and wet diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have already gathered on them: and they did not disagree in the remedy with cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know you children, that from the secret of the cure by means of cauterization with fire, and its goodness with cauterization while burning is: because the fire is simple, whose action does not penetrate, unless to the limb that is cauterized: and it does not harm another member connected with it, except with a little injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of medicine that burns peruses to the part that is prolonged from it: and perhaps makes happen a difficult cure of disease in the member, and perhaps destroys it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	For this has already been made known to us by experience, because of the length of service and study with art, and the standing on the truth of things: and for this I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if there is not, because it is not allowed to this my book, I shall bring you a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of his operation in its bodies its expulsion, which expels ailments with a philosophical demonstration, which was made by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know you sons, that they differ in the time, in which it is to be done cauterization, and put better time for the wound.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say, that cauterization is to be done at any time: for the damage, which happens by time, is hidden in the juice, which is attracted with cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And above all, if the cauterization is because of pains from necessary pains, hard, festivities, which do not tolerate delay: for they are afraid of them, that evil happens, which is greater than a small damage intrans to time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not fall in the minds of you sons that they are not careful, unless the common and stupid doctors: namely, that to them the sickness, which is healed by cauterization, is not always a return: and they put this consequence, and the thing is not as they think: for cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which changes complexion, and dries humidities, because they cause pains.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	But the cauterization is too much on medicine by its velocity of its virtue, and the strength of its operation, and the quickness of its lordship: and it is possible that it brings back disease at some hour of time according to complexion of sickness, and place of sickness, and virtue of its operation: and that it is prepared in his body from aggregation of excess in him: and that it attains to itself in acquisition of its from food, and similar things from causes, unless it happens sickness, in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	The subtle sickness in a member of few excesses and humidities, as the cauterization of tooth, because of pain, and similar to it, is possible indeed, that it does not bring back in him that pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that is fitting for few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But that is fitting for few.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But this is contrary to what they intend, and the intention, that the cautery is the last resort of medicine, is not, unless when we administer ways of cure in some diseases, and these do not confer the medicines: then we administer at the end of the thing a cautery, and it confers: then from there it falls, that the cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many of the doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancient ones said that when it comes to gold, the cautery is better than the cautery with iron: and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold, and the limitation of its substance: and they said that there is no place for a cautery.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But this is not absolutely so: because I have already tested it, and I found that it does not do it in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cautery with itself is good, and better than the cautery with iron, as they say.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	But when you ignite the cautery from gold in fire, it does not appear to you, when it ignites according to the quantity that you use, because of the redness of gold: and when it is appropriate for it to cool down, and if you add ignition on top of it, it melts in fire, and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the craftsman fall from it in business: and because of this it is fitting that the cautery with iron is faster and closer to us, according to the straightness towards the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have already arranged this chapter in the Cautery, according to chapters: and I arranged it from the head to the feet: so that those who seek it may find it from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	About the way of cauterizing the head in the commissure of the crown.
Caput II.	Chapter Two.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Chapter Two: Here is a treatment for the excess of heat and cold in the brain: These two are the causes of headaches and a multiplicity of fluxes of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of a multiplicity of dreams, toothache, and sore throat, and universally all ailments that occur from cold, such as paralysis, spasms, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ailments from those ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is this, as you have ordered to the sick: that he be emptied with liquid medicine, and his head be washed three nights or four, according to the strength of the illness and its age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then order him to rub his head with a warm cloth.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then let him sit between your hands square, so that he has put his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Therefore whenever your middle finger touches any spot with difficulty, mark that place with a brand.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then light the cautery with olive oil: whose this form is.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the person himself on the marked spot with the brand, and let your hands compress him slowly, and he will turn away from you.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see there a quantity of salt from the bone, or a quantity of herbs, then lift your hand quickly.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the compressing with iron, or with something else when he grows cold: until you see the bones, which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and immerse it in a cloth, and place it on the spot: and let him go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place over the person the cloth immersed in butter, and let him go on the spot until the fire is extinguished.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then that care with the four-part ointment, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	I have said, that as long as the wound remains open, it will emit puss: therefore it is better and more salutary.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said, let the skin be cauterized all the way down to the bone: and let the cautery be held, until a certain hardness of bone is attained.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then let it be rubbed after that which is burnt from the bone, then let it be poulticed.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say, that it should be done with the cautery all the way down to the last, until an impression is made on the bone like a mold: or an instrument which women put in with a letter-board: and they determine, that vapors from this place are exhaled when one exhales through this opening for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then let it be poulticed, until it has hardened.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But these two kinds of cautery are not known to me at all unless in some men according to the second for fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And let it be removed, for me it is better with the health of it.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by continued solution of its natural substance: as we have testified in the other members: and especially when the head is feeble with nature: and the kind of cautery first is more salutary and better with me, and I use it: therefore let us operate while it is healthy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Regarding the mode of cauterizing the head in a case of headache throughout the whole head.

Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head: and it is prolonged in a sick person, and uses herbs, and poultices, and washings, and oils, and medications.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And above all if it has been cauterized with one kind of cautery which we have mentioned, and gives no benefit from it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is healthy with strong nature, and is not feeble, and finds a sharp cold: then cauterize under it a little with another kind of cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then he cauterizes himself on all the horns of his head with his own cautery, and does not let the skin pass through, and lets a quantity come out from the bone, which we have said.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And he cauterizes himself with one cautery in the nape of his head, in the place which is called a canal; and it is a place in which the wind is put; and clean your mind in this place, and do not let your bone come out.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For that pain is found through it, and is far from the pain of all the other parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this Cautery in its place: and it is necessary that it should be a cautery by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the nape of the head is more finely cauterized by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	De The mode of cauterizing in headache, whether with the medicine alone, or with iron as well.
Caput IIII.	Head 4.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When it is in a part of the head pain and salt, or extends the pain all the way to the eye, and washes out with cleaning medicines, and gives the remaining treatment which I have spoken of in divisions of diseases, and does not bring that whole one: then the cauterization in him is according to two ways: either the cauterization with sharp burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But the Cautery with sharp burning medicine is, that you take one of your teeth, and saw it out, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain with a blade in the time when the phlebotomist cuts it from side to side, until it is made in him a place under the skin, in which the bone is captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then introduce it into him under the skin, until it is hidden: then tighten it over it with a constricting thread that comes down, and let it out by the quantity of fifteen hours, and then dissolve it, and take off the other, and let it lie for two days, or three: then put on it a cotum immersed in butter, until a pus place is made: then cure the place with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to make it with some medicines that burn, which I wrote in the twelfth treatise, on medicines applied to the middle parts.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization however of that with iron, is according to this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Of fire the cauterization, whose form this is.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a clavis: because the form of his head is like the form of a clave, in which there is some little eminence in the middle.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put the same on the place, and hold your hand: and you shall turn the iron little by little with velocity: and the quantity that is to be burned of the thickness of the skin, as it were a half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And take your hand away, lest you burn the artery that is below, and there happen to be a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then dip the cloth in salt water, and put it on the place, and leave it three days: then dip the same in butter: afterwards take care with an unguent until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish to make a wound, cauterize this headache with a sharp knife the second time of the cauterization.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And do not cure from an incision in this headache, not an old one on his own.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	As for the mode of cauterizing in a headache that is old.
Caput V.	The head.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you cure a headache, when with this that we said before of curing, and what we said in the divisions of sicknesses, and there is no cura: and you shall see from the sickness, that it is not sufficient to him that we said of cauterization first with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then you should turn the fires of cauterization little by little, until it whiteneth after the signs on the place of the pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost so: and put your hand away with force one way, and squeeze it till you hit the artery, and go on to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However you should cure from the continuing of the jaw, which moves when it grinds, lest it burn on the side, or the nerve that moves it, from where comes a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this is on the guard and caution against the flow of blood from the artery, which has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For fear of the cutting off of that artery, and more so to him who knows not what he does, and is not studious, nor experienced: and dismisses the operation with it at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come to talk about the treatment of an injury from a blood vessel, according to its method, and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	That if you see from sickness that it is not sufficient to this Cautery, and you see the body bearing the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, care for the wound, until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see, administer the cautery, which we have said in the chapter of cutting the artery with a cautery having two scissors.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For the cauterization is better and gives more help in this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Regarding the method of cauterizing the ears.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When a pain happens in the ear from cold, and is healed with solutiuns, and the remaining cure as we have said in the division, and the pain does not remove, then to the fire Cautery: and this is what is called a Puncture, of which the shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the punctures with it after its igniting around the whole ear, as it is relieved: or in the circumference of either, if at the same time a pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen it with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked the places with encaustic: and let the amount of the cautery be ten points all over the ear, and almost that same amount.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the place, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in torture.

Torture which is healed with cauterization, is not except from the species which happen from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And cauterized the species which happened from drying and muscle spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with hyoscyamus and calamine and gargles and your treatment does not bring about a cure, then you should cauterize the sick three times: one at the root of the ear, and second slightly below its edge, and third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For the softening does not take place unless in the part that seems healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is so that you cauterize yourself with the Cautery in the direct extremity of the upper ear under the corner of the head a little bit: and another in time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery, until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and its species is from a chisel, whose shape is precede: verumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit chisel in ea superfluae grossitudinis parum.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with what preceded it: until it is healed.

In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	But in the cauterium with fire, order the patient first of it, so that he lets go of his hair, if he is from those who wash them, until they grow long and are even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if he is pricked by it at his root: then tighten his eyes with vitriol, so that they do not move, until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.

Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	To a sick person, it is necessary to remove hair from the head until the disease subsides and becomes stable.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make in the form of a leaf of mulberry paper.

Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	Then consider, if you see the eyelid go down, as if it were going out with fire or with an incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat on top of it from the medicine to the place where it does not print and does not harm, until your operation has equated it, and the eye has clenched.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place on top of it a cotton with butter, until the dried-up skin is removed.

Prescribe to the sick person that he should put his head in your lap, and hold it between your hands so that it does not move or be disturbed with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put the coturnic Infusum on the white of his eye, or on psyllum mucilage over his eye: then apply the cautery to it, whose form is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	It should be round, as the shape of a knife's blade from one end, which makes the cautery: and if the blade goes down to the other end, and if the blade is raised like this.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this round cautery is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula if it is open, and extract what is in it, and dry it up: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract the pus from it.

Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold it near the eye, toward the nose side, so that your hand does not move or be disturbed: and put the cautery into the fat of the eye, and disintegrate it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If then there is pus in the beginning of your cautery up to the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you can bear it: and dismiss it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put on the cotton with butter, and treat himself with an ointment of drying, until he is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If he does not heal after forty days, then put on him an acute corrosive medicine, until he detects the bone: and then read it according to what came in his chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And another method of cautery is a funnel, which some said first.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Intend to the place of the funnel, and find it: then put into it a thin cannula, that is to say, A thin tube, whose shape is thus:

And pour into it a quantity of lead liquid, and hold your hand with the cane firmly, so that the sick man does not move at all, lest he run or the liquid lead gets to his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And you should put on the eye of the sick person a cotton poultice in milk or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the place of the funnel and heals it with a wonderful cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the funnel is healed, with what I have said about cautery and cure, is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.

Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let there be a quantity of what is to be burned from the thickness of the skin, a quantity of half of it not added: and let the sick stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his limbs, and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the caustic.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And you also may do this caustic with a knife-caustic, when there is subtlety and wisdom with you in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself, that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and that the thickness of the skin is burned throughout, because the skin there is thin, know that one.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	De mode cauterizandi apotema epatis:
Caput XXX.	[30] Caput XXXI.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an exitio is found and you know, if that apostema is in the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the liver, there is a dull pain, and there is acuteness of sensation: and you will see that the treatment of the liver fatigues the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore let the sick person lie on his back on his bed.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the place of the apostema with the caustic: then the fires of the caustic which are absorbed by the radii.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that one caustic until the skin is burned throughout, and reaches the sipho, until it emerges in its entirety: then take care of the cure of the exiting ailments, until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary that this form of the caustic be used, unless the study of medicine is prolonged in someone: and because sometimes with some experience diseases of this kind are encountered: then let him dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But I prefer to send it away.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	[31] De mode cauterizandi in pleurese:
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that they used to apply a wound with the roots of aristolocheia to pleurisy in a cold way according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is as if you should take from the roots of aristolocheia dry long roots that are found in it and should be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse him in oil: and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then apply cautery with one cautery on him that is between the point of a fork and the neck, and two small cauteries under the chin slightly inclined on either side, which are under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two cauteries also in him that is between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly inclined towards the back: and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from behind: one in him that is between two spatulas: and two cauteries from the sides of the breast, lower cautery that is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And your hand should not be compressed with cautery, but rather it should be in open skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient men said that they used to use a cautery made of iron like a wire: and light it up, and put it inside him that is between the ribs until it reaches the bile, and let the pus come out: as we have said in the bilial discharge.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with cautery there is a fear that either the weak one immediately dies, or a hole occurs in which there is no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Regarding the method of cauterizing the spleen:
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you cure the spleen disease, when you have divided the disease as we have said in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then cauterize it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is that you make three cauteries, or four lined up according to the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauterii of the liver, whose predecessor was the figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And [the quantity of] gruel between all cauterizations is the size of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let there be a mode for the caustics, which we have said in the caustic of the liver equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the caustic; and let the sick person lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another mode of cauterization is that the caustics have two edges, which we have said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and dry up the skin, which is in the direct splen, where it reaches the cubitus on the left side of the sick person: and let your elevation be raised according to the length of the body, so that the caustics fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two burning edges keenly, until they penetrate the skin from the other part: then remove the caustic: so there are four caustics.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a caustic that has three edges.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then treat the caustic, after you have removed it, with emollient for many days: for it is more helpful than each preceding one in the course of cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the mode of cauterizing in Hydropsis.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The caustic does not fall in Hydropsis, unless it is properly raised.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat Hydropsis with the modes of cure which we have said in the division, and there is no effect from the treatment, then let there be four caustics around the navel, and one caustic on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the spine, and one in front of the heart, and another in front of the stomach: and let the depth of the caustic be proportionate to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the caustic while it is still open, that it may emit pus after a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not wet the sick person again after the caustic, with that same one: for it is necessary that two purposes be combined with it; and he will soon recover health with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the caesarian section where the abdomen is opened, sits on a bend: according to the fact that it precedes in form; and its back, where it is caesarian, sits on an olive, according to the fact that it precedes in form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	De mode cauterizandi pedes et crura:
Caput XXXIIII.	[Head of Chapter LXXIV.]
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are laid up with the hydropic disease, and become filled with a yellow liquid: you must cauterize over the back of the foot in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and the ring: and wet your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then wet your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water, and sit the cautery according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make over the two legs the two cauteries in all the leg, and let the cautery be made with the edge of a chisel-shaped cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other lower down that way, about halfway through the leg: and over all the pelvis two cauteries: and do not close the cautery at once for a long time: so that it is relieved from it some water: then care for the wound with the rest as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	De mode cauterizandi in solutione ventris:
Caput XXXV.	[Head of Chapter LXX.]
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the belly is loosened from cold and moisture, until it has lost its ability to retain virtutes and digestion, which are in the stomach and intestines: and cure it with the modes of treatment, and does not heal: and you shall see that it bears the injury of the great power of cauterization, then cauterize it with a big cautery over its own stomach, according as it was preceded in cauterizing the stomach with a cautery in the form of a circle, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a small edge-shaped cautery: and a big cautery or two cauteries over the alcatins.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see moisture exuberant, and that it bears the injury of that, then cauterize it with a cautery over the ribcage, and a cautery over all the pelvis: and possibly you shall add two small cauteries by the side of the big one in the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For healing is the work of one who knows his business well.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	The mode of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of gross humor, cold, or corrupt humors, and they are treated with that which we have said in the division, and the cure is not effective: then cauterize three cauteries on the lower part of the back spine under an egg-shaped triangle, and a cautery under the navel almost like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see that his face is pale, then cauterize him on the back of the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and a cautery on his spleen, and another on his liver, with a clove: and leave the cautery open for some time: and then take care of himself, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	The mode of cauterizing athel (a small blood vessel) after its amputation.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut off the athel, then set fire to the cautery which is absorbed by radiation.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the fire into the athel that has been cut off: and with your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the anus, from which runs blood: do this once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many athels, then cauterize each one with a separate cautery, as we have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them, with the oil that is effective for them, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on his back, it is more painful in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	The mode of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not submit to the section and the operation that we have described in its place, and trembles at it, perhaps he will be healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	And so, when a fistula occurs in someone and it is old, pus runs out of it, and corrupted humors flow out.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is therefore worthwhile that one should probe it gently with the hand.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the depth of its extent by probing.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply a hot cautery, which is like a ray of light.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself into the fistula with fire and recognize how much it enters by observing the closure.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat this cautery on it until all the corrupted bodies are burned, once, twice, or three times, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from the heat of fire if there is any nerve there or large veins: or if the fistula leads to the body of the womb, or the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not perform this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and be aware, for it does not pierce through.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed and material has been cut off from it and remains for a long time in this condition: then know that it has already healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if material is not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating or has a corrupted opening within its depth, or nearly so: whose memory will remain in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	The method of cauterizing the Renes.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold, or from gross wind, and is assuaged by urination, then one should cauterize the kidneys above the mesh on the kidneys, cauterizing each kidney with a cautery knife, whose precursor was memory.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we can cauterize it again in the same place.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why are there three lines drawn?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	So that they will be longer in the cutting.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	The method of cauterizing the Vesica (Bladder).
Caput XL.	Chapter Ten.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder because of cold and moisture, until the sick person does not retain his urine, then cauterize him on the lower part of the penis above the bladder, where the hairs begin to grow, and cauterize with one cautery from the right side, and another with a cautery from the left: and let the length of that cautery be according to the length of the thumb knuckle: and cauterize him with two cauteries if you wish so. And let it be according to what preceded the cautery with a claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	The way to cauterize the womb:
Caput XLI.	Chapter Eleven.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is prevented from being impregnated by that, and her menstrual flow corrupts and delays their time, and pain occurs for her during intercourse, then three cauteries should be used around the navel as we have said in cauterizing the bladder, and one cautery above the lower back with a knuckle, or two cauteries: and let it be according to what preceded the cautery with a claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	The way to cauterize the anus in a dislocation:
Caput XLII.	Chapter Twelve.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous membrane of the anus flows with moisture towards the rectum, and there is a cause for its exit from its place: its sign is that the crust prolongs itself over the other when they face each other: and the location of the dislocation is found in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it should be that the sick person is cauterized over the anus with a similar circle of cautery: after you have found the signs with the fire in the circumcision of the anus, as it turns: and so that it falls on the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the shape of that which preceded the cautery in the cauterization of the stomach be.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present with you, then cauterize him with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin of all.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then the care for him, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The way of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Head XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the shank of the leg, and there is cause for his coldness and moisture: and the care for the sick one is joined with it, which we have said in the division, and there is no cure, and it becomes old: then it is necessary that you separate the sick one from gross humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the way of the cautery is according to two ways: either with the cautery with burning medicines, or with the fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cautery with fire is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is that, that he cauterizes above the shank of his leg three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make their depth good, or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there is space that is between every cautery of the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and there is an olive-oil cautery.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, the cautery is made in the middle on the top of his leg.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose predecessor is the form in the cauterization of the dislocation of the shank, one: that there is a circle containing the whole shank.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin of all.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the way of cautery in sciatica, when pain adheres to the shank itself, and does not extend up to the hip and the leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends up to the hip and the leg, then cauterize him with two cauteries on the hip, on the place to which the pain extends, and on your own cautery over the back of four fingers slightly: and there is a cautery-knife.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And make the depth of the cautery according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient complains that the pain extends up to the fingers of the foot, then cauterize him at that place with a point, line, triangle, or square, as needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he complains of pain under the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize him at that place with a single knife cut.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And let your cauterization be such that you do not hurt with the cauldron as it burns nerves, or a large artery, and do not attract it to the bad injury of the sick person, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have already seen one and the other, those who cauterized above the knee and ended with cauterization, and the leg was swollen, until the tumor became attached to the foot, and it was corroded all over; and then the blood of the wound was dissolved, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this mode.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise ones have said in the cauterization ofanchae, whose cauterization is this mode.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar model from iron, the diameter of which is half of the palm: and be at the opening of it according to the size of the nail, or less than more: and within that model there is another model.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And be a space that is between each model by the quantity of the thumb's nail: and let the openings be on two sides: and make their height almost like a knuckle, or two knuckles: and let them make handles out of iron that are crookedly adapted in the models.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in fire, until it turns red, and let sparks fall out: then let it be placed on a flat stone of theanchae lying down on the sound side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cauterizations in one direction.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him go for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then bind it with butter: and let the hole be left open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then the care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasius replied, With this type of burn, we are not very skilled, because of its frightening appearance: and therefore, because there are few who wait on it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, a good scarification is what the patient needs, and his place remains with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But the cauterization when you apply medicines is, so that you make two threads with a piercing ring, in which descends the pin of his door from brass or iron, whose length is equal to the depth of his walls: of which there are two knots, or almost the same as himself.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be space between each one, equal to the thickness of a finger, and both open downward and upward: and that they should contain themselves against the side opposite, in this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then put it on the patient's back, lying on his sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly on the patient's back.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then fill between the two circles with warm water, slightly heated with fire, and hold it for a time: and let the patient bear his pricking, and his burning, because he feels the pricking like fire, until it is calm.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wash your hand with an instrument, and rinse all of it thoroughly with sweet water: then let it go for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it, until it comes off due to the burning; and let it go for a few days, and wash away the pus.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	This is the latest in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that wound with ointment, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg: let him have a position in it that contains water, according to what you did in the width, evenly.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the way of warm water: and I have already written about it in my book on the rectifying of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkaline and un-extinct lime on both sides, turn them over, and put them in a new bowl, the lower part of which is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity that goes in: and put under the base of the bowl another bowl upside down: and pour water from the two, so that it immerses each one with a finger: then grasp them with your good hand: and set them aside, until the sharp water comes out on the lower side of the bowl.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then put together all the water, and pour it over another stone: and tie it up, until it has healed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For herself will then be strong and keenness of her own, which is used in many surgical operations, and in the cauterization of the remaining members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Since it will effect the operation by its own fire.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines are used, with which they cauterize the broad, also as therapeutics, and honey of anacardium, and lime mixed with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself reported, of a certain man from ancient healing, who was cured of pain in the anus and sciatica: and he praised that it was great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, "He did not like any other treatment," and that he was cured from one ass because he reported: "Perhaps he entered a hot bath, and came out already well.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, to be taken from the seat of a man: and if it is not found a woman, it is taken like this, recently: and it is heated much with some fat, and placed on the anus, where there is pain, or in the crotch: and it is tied up, and is left for the quantity of three hours, or per quantity that he feels weak sedation from heat.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce it into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When the body then becomes red-hot, introduce him into the soil.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain has passed away, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that it is not necessary to use any cauterization with these medicines, unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that when sheep manure is burned with it, it is good for the sciatica, and it makes a second-type cautery.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take the wool, and let it soak in old oil, and place it on a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the heel, and is closer to the fire.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take the dung of goats and mix it with fire, until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place the mixture on a woolen cloth and leave it there until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	So do not cease to perform this, until the sense has become accustomed through the medium up to the tip of the nose, and the pain rests.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	This mode of treatment is called the Vacca's cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	[¶] On the cauterization of dolor dorsi.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 42.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs on the back from various causes, either from accident, or from impact, or from excessive drainage and similar things, then the cauterization should not be done unless in this single case alone, which is done with cold and wet material infusions.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore after the drainage of the nurse with foetid pills and similar things, let them be placed on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the length of the midline affected, having first marked with encaustum in each line five cauterization, or more according to the quantity which has come from the tolerance of the nurse's virtue: and let the cauterization be done with a cauterizing needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if there is need, cauterize three cauterizations, or four, with the middle clauwile, in this form:
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	[¶] On the mode of cauterizing in the gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This disease frequently occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of the incipient stage of this disease in children is that which occurs on him a stricture in the anus during defecation and movement: and an inflammation in the last joint of the back and the nodules of it, which has already begun to emerge over the other joints.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	Therefore when you see this, and wish to treat it, then let the cauterization be made with a needle which is a circle according to this form:
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he took the cautery and applied it equally to all parts of the spine; and if the cautery was used around the spine with two or three points of the needle, and the needles were close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then he cared for the place until it healed with that which I have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And do not apply the cautery to the hunchback, which is made in a spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	The way to cauterize in podagra and pain of joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of the joints are from cold humidities that flow into any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of the doctors to name this podagra properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	So then how to cure podagra caused by cold with the methods of treatment, and do not remove the pains, then remove them with the cautery.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is so, that he cauterized him after evacuation around the joint of the feet with many needles; and let the cautery be Oileus.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you can endure that the needles are on the face of the foot, then do it with a single needle.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	That if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and often happens that, then cauterize him over all the knee with three needles, or four from all parts, with this same cautery of Chlorius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need more of this cautery, then cauterize him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but let there be a little bit of thick skin only on the skin around it.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer that which I have said in my book from the cautery.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	That if the pains are only in the hands, then the points around a small flame, as two lines rotate.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if the pain remains in the fingers, then point them out, over every knot a point, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however the pains rise after a few days at the shoulders, or at the arms, then cauterize both sides at all parts.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not make the sick person sweat from good regimen, from reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if the regimen is made good, and the phlegm is made to sweat, it will be healed with this cautery and the help of God.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	The mode of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LVII. Head.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine has descended, or has touched the testicle, and it is beginning to become close: then you should order the sick person to abstain from food on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that the stool may come out of its own volition from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then make him sit between your hands on his back; and order him to hold his breath, until he has gone out, or appears the buttock, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce him with your fingers, and mark with the caustic under the rupture on the crest of the pelvis, with a mark whose extreme is similar to half a circle to the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then hold the caustic fire, which has this form, until it is white, and let it fall off little by little.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or the buttock to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the minister put his hand on the place so that he does not exit the intestine: and you have now opened between the ribs, and placed under it the pole of the bed, and one serves as a lever by holding the foot of the patient, and another leans over the pelvis, and holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then let the caustic fall on the patient with the right hand, while holding the caustic fire upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him, until you have joined his jaws: or repeat with another lever, if you do not succeed with him on the first attempt up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, lest you burn him, and let it go through that into the body, or death, or great malice.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And you shall know that when you do not achieve a closed wound with the cautery, your operation will not succeed.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	It is necessary that the cautery for infants be subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the remaining unguent until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let him lie on his back for forty days, until the scar is closed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you put food for him according to the length of his curing time, which softens his belly: so that he does not vomit up what he has eaten and has no bowel movement.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a loose ligature and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him not work, nor fill himself with food or drink, nor take strong drinks.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he heals with whole health.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will tell you the cure for Torns, with an incision in their own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, Torns happen in the rest of the body, and are beginning, and do not add to one another, then cauterize his Torn with round cautery according to its quantity: and let it be what is healed from then on as the third one.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then take care for him, with him who we have said: and do not add to him.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some have said first: that the Torn should be cauterized with triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	Afterwards, it is signed with wax, and a line is put which is across the width at the back of the Torn, and another line to the front.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the clawing cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	The way to cauterize in cases of pain, or percussion.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 58.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in some member by accident, or by percussion: and this pain persists for a long time, and your treatment does not succeed in it: then it is necessary to cauterize with Pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let there be a cautery for every member according to its size, and its health, and its weakness, and its strength, and its location of twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If then is healed by the first cauterization, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat on the same place the cauterization.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For from the custom of these pains is that they should be changed from one member to that which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Why it should be that these should be followed with cauterization, until the weak one is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the manner of cauterizing for leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Head 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	And for leprosy, whenever they are increased, let them be cauterized with the greatest care.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of leprosy, which is made by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: so that when you are cauterizing it, consider well its shape.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If then is insistent leprosy, and you have treated it with care when it comes down, and has not stood, and has covered the whole complexion: then cauterize it on top five cauterizations: one in the middle of the head's knot, and the second lower than that going towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above two horns, and one behind the ear.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And the last hand with a little cauterization, until it presses on the gums a deep impression, and the membranes are dislocated from them: so that the expiration of thick vapors comes out of it, and cauterize it with cautery also on top of the spleen, according to what preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if leprosy has already spread on the weak one, and it appears clearly: then you should cauterize it with these cauterizations, which we have said in the head, and a cauterization on the extremities of the nose, and two cauterizations on each of the cheeks, and two cauterizations on the two bones of the neck, and one great one at the bottom of the throat, and one above it: and two on the two shoulders, and two on the two hips, and two on the two breasts, and one on the whole body, from the joints of fingers of both hands and feet, and one on each heel of the feet, and fillets of the hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And because of the nerves that are above the last bone of the foot, so that you don't burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when the cautery is applied with fire to the ospectines, and to the os stomachi, and to the osépar.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you should know that the more you apply the cautery, the greater the benefit, and the more it confers.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you should know that a sick person does not feel pain in the cautery, as he feels it when he is healthy: therefore, because his body is already stuporified.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And let the tools be of proper size and shape according to the limbs and joints: and because they have been preceded by the appearance of the instruments of surgery.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care to apply the cautery with flour of herb mixed with honey, and with other cure, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	The mode of applying the cautery in stupor:
Caput L.	(Head)
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a limb is stuporified and treated with medicines, oils, plasters, and is not healed, then cautery the limb that is stuporified with cauterias, according as the magnitude of the limb is increased, or its parity is diminished.

Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care to apply the medicine on it with ointment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when the cautery is applied to some kind of stupor that occurs in the hand or foot at the exits of the nerves that move that limb: and the stupor disappears.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But he does not presume over it, unless he is wise in anatomy of limbs, and knows the exit of the nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	The mode of applying the cautery in Albaras:
Caput LI.	(Head)
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras is applied to the head and does not confer any benefit to it with medicines: then apply a deep cautery on it little by little, according as there is thickness of skin, until the skin is bleached and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then the cure itself with wheat flour, and lentil oil with rose, and leaves of arnica, and pigeon's blood, and hynd's blood: from each one let there be a part: all these things are mixed together, and they are spread out on a cloth, and they adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	The method for cauterizing cancer:
Caput LII.	CHAPTER LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the cancer is beginning to appear, and to press upon it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery, as it turns.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise men have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not choose that one, because I am afraid that it will burst out: and I have seen it sometimes.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize it all around with a circle, as we have said: or with many cautery's.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	The method for cauterizing a pustule:
Caput LIII.	CHAPTER LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has a pustule, and it is delayed in its maturation, or because it is making too much of a mess, or because of age, when it is feeble with little blood, or because of time, and the pus is running ahead in its maturation: then cauterize all around it with many small punctures.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let it go.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten in its maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you are going to pierce it with a cautery, then take this kind of fire.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And lay the fire upon it in the middle of the pustule, until it enters the skin: and let the cautery follow it, so that the course of the pus may be eased.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of the pustule until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	The method for cauterizing a gangrenous wound:
Caput LIIII.	CHAPTER LIIIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Gangrene is not anything but corruption in a member that walks, and it corrupts the part itself: just as fire eats dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see corruption in the place which tolerates cautery with fire, then many cauteries of fire, small and great, and cloys in the place where the corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize him himself from every part until you root out all corruption, and nothing remains of it within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let him be left for three days, and put over the places cauterized sulfur trodden with oil, until all the escarres are eradicated, and all corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for him with ointments generating flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days the flesh is born healthy, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then again cauterize him over the places that remained from the corrupted parts.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corrosion is treated sometimes with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it itself rises up in the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cauterization with fire is faster in its action: and I have already said above cauterization with acute medicine in division: so take it then there when you can bear it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	The way of cauterizing in small places and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This disease often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a gross, filtered, infection that affects the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there are two ways of cauterization: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with warm water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As much as it is with fire, so that the fires of small cauterization are like the flame of a hair-comb: which let it be made from iron, according to the quantity which contains a clove completely: and let it be subtle at the edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then put the burned one on the clove.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then roll the hand with the cautery around the clove, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the clove: and let him be left for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply the plaster to the wound with silk threads, crushed with salt: and let the plaster rest on the flesh during the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For himself will be rooted out from his roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a poultice of flesh, until it heals over.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not turned and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then apply cauterization with warm water: and there is, so that you take a tube from bronze, or iron, or a feathers of a vulture: and lay it down over a claw, or a thistle.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour into the tube a little quantity of warm water: hold your hand over it, and rotate it slightly so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the claw root, and let the warm water come to the surface, to the claw root: and let the sick person wait a little while on the sensation of the warm water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release him, for the claw will be rooted out with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do so with one at a time, until you have finished with all of them in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are rooted out, with that which generates flesh from the ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	The way of cauterizing in a tremor:
Caput LVI.	Head LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone in a tremor from cold in the nerve, or from the quartan fever, or otherwise: then one should cauterize the person four cauterizations, or five on the back vertebrae, and between each vertebra a cauterization, and in his chest a cauterization, and over his stomach a cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	A tremor quiets down with the olive oil cauterization, and the health of the disease of cold quiets it down quickly.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The way of cauterizing with Al-Bahri:
Caput LVII.	Head LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When they are expelled from the body Al-Bahri food, that is, pustules which are formed from coarse corrupted materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is necessary therefore in the first place that, when it appears, they be cauterized over the whole head of the pustule with a fine cauterizer made of myrrh wood, whose end is inflamed with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or, when it comes to the root of artichoke, long.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or, when it comes to a lenticular cauterizer.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with the emulsion, at first its expulsion according to this mode: and if it does not increase, and breaks up the superfluity making them, and heals out of them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that that be done after the evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the mode of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in the ulna.
Caput LVIII.	Head LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that the blood flows out from an artery which is cut in the ulna, which occurs externally, or at the incision of a pimple, or a cauterized member, and such things: and it happens difficult to remove it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	But when it has happened to anyone of this, then take with your hand at the opening of the artery, and put over it the thumb: and tighten it much, until the blood is overcome under your thumb, and does not emerge from it anything.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put in a fire a little olive cauterizer, and great number more: and blow over it, until the fires are very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take out of them one, or small, or big, according to the ulna and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery over it, after which you move your thumb quickly: and hold the cautery, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	That if it is driven out with the fingers from the opening of the artery, and the cautery is extinguished, then take another cautery quickly, from the cauteries which are prepared in fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease to be doing that with one after another, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerves which are there, and some other evil befall the sick.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you shall know that when blood flows from an artery, it is then impossible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four measures.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a caustic, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, the extremities of it are bruised, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or is bound with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or are laid upon the part by virtue of its medicine, which makes it necessary to cut off the blood, and is strangled with a constricting poultice.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever applies the incision with a ligature, and constriction with a poultice, or the positioning of burning things, and others like that, does not give him relief unless it is rare.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this happens to anyone and there is no present doctor or medicine: then let the digit of the index be placed upon the orifice of his wound, as we have related, and constricted with great force, until the blood from the upper part of the wound is stopped, and applied to the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And let the finger not be moved away from it, always with cold water, until the blood is congealed, and thickened, and cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And while this is being done, consider what is needed from a caustic, or from medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	[The First Part Ending]
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	(The Surgery Book of Albucasis Part II)
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	(On Incision, Puncture, and Bloodletting on Wounds and Similar Matters)
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken at length in the First Chapter of all sickness where applicable, and of fire, of medicine, and the causes thereof, and of the instruments, and of the forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And there I placed those chapters from the beginning to the end.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: that it may be a help to him who seeks it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, you should know that in this chapter it is from a terror that is in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, a greater caution is needed in this chapter, since in the operation which is in this chapter, the fall of blood often occurs with the opening of the vein, or the incision on the pustule, or the opening of the exiture, or the cure of the wound, or the extraction of the arrow, or the incision on the stone, and those are similar: from all of which, tremor and fear associate themselves, and death often falls in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you not to fall into that which is a stumbling block, for when sometimes those who have fallen into this art of men with types of diseases come to you.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is one who becomes angry with his illness, and is lighter with him death: because of the vehemence of his illness that he finds from his disease and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when the illness is from fear which means death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is one who gives you a gift, and promises you with it, hoping for health, but his illness is pernicious.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore do not consent to him who comes to you from them, whose way is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And be a greater caution on our part, than our greed and our avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presumptuous about anything from him, unless after certain knowledge, which confirms with you that success is worthy of praise.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And so you will do in the care of all your sick people, forecasting and indicating about it to where healing is appropriate.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in it there is an aid for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you his guidance and inspiration: for it is in his hands.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I too have arranged this chapter by sections, according to what preceded it in the chapter on cautery, from the neck down to the feet: that you may find what you seek from it and that which you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the treatment of water that is gathered in the heads of boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this illness often occurs in boys at the time of birth: or when the midwife grips the boy's head without any lightness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens for an unknown reason which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I too have never seen this disease in anyone other than boys; and I have looked into every one of them who had it, for that reason I thought it right to leave the operation alone.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I too have seen a boy among them whose head was filled with water; and his head grew larger every day until he couldn't sit on his own, because of the size of his head; and his moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or it is gathered between the skin and the jaw: or it is gathered under the bone above the jaw.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on him, if it is moisture between the skin and the jaw, and a little swelling there; then you should find in the middle of the head a single crevice in width: and the length of the crevice is almost like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the incision.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If then the moisture is increased and the swelling is larger; then place two incisions, according to this shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the scalp's edges open from all sides: and when you press it with your hand towards the inside, it doesn't hide it from you; then you should find in the middle of the head three creases, according to this fashion.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then, tightly bind the fissures with rags and powder.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then, wrap it in a swath of cloth soaked in wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then, loosen the ligaments, and care for the tendon with tar and linseed oil.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop binding the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick on dry food with little moisture, until the limb is healed and the wound has healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	Another kind of incision is this: you should take into consideration where there is a lot of blood vessels, and where the accumulation of blood is great.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For when it is in the back, more or less, on the right or left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So then with the incision where you see the blood vessels and the accumulation of blood: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And pay attention not to hit an artery, so that there is no flow of blood, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Regarding incisions in the arteries, which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	The second head.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When a discharge occurs to the eyes, or to the chest, and it does not respond to medication: then the last resort is to cut these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	So you must do this when you want to make an incision on them, so that the sick person does not turn his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then, cover the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person should tie his neck with any of his own cloth.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is beating.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places are those that are behind the ears depressed: and rarely hides, except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with encaustic on either side: and cut each one with a chisel so that the incision reaches to the mouth: and let it go across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce the chisel under the artery, and cut it from above with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the new wound is incised, there gushes out a pulsating blood flow, which rises to the inside with a regular jump.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear by feeling, then one should measure from the edge the quantity of space of three fingers' length.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a caustice, and find until the nose.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which needs to be emitted from the blood, is six minutes, and perhaps you emit more or less of it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this is according to the quantity which appears to you from the pulse and the filling up of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider towards the joint.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	And if there remains to the nose from the siffar [a kind of surgical tool] something, then incise that so as not to cause a swelling of heat: and then tighten the joint with liniments of linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of himself with ointment, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	As for the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that he has an old headache, or acute catarrah by reason of the acrid and moist humors, and heat in the sockets of the temples, or ancient soda, stinging, and similar things: and he is treated with the methods of medicine, and does not send that: then we are skilled in these diseases in the extraction of the arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have related.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them is, that the sick person shaves the hair which is in the temples, and extends it towards the artery which appears in the socket.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it shows itself to you from its pulse, and rarely hides unless in a few people, or when there is a great coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it hides itself from you, then let the sick person tie his own head with any of his clothes: and then make the hole with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or make the place warm with hot water, until it appears to you by a manifest appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatulum, which I made a little before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the wound with ease until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert into it a hook, and remove it from above, until you remove it from the skin, and make it ooze with blood from the tunics that are beneath it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is thin: then wrap it up with the hook's end.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it on that side according to how long its ends are, and turn them inward, and do not allow the blood to flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it does not come off, the blood will not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then make it ooze with blood from above six ounces up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Now if the artery is large: then it should be tied with two pairs of double thread, strong and silk: or with horsehair, so that it does not become putrefied before the wound heals over, and allow blood to flow.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ties.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Make it so at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, burn it with a knife until the wound is dry, using a surgical knife; until the ends move to their own place in the operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And this work is better if the patient has no fever, or if his skin is warmed up.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the knife is made of those things that remain to dry out the humidity.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to cut with a knife.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after drawing out the arteries, so that the place may be filled with old fat: and they are placed on top of the flesh, made to swell a little.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after applying the medicine with dry herbs, which cause new meat to grow, and with liniments, until it heals over.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Now if while you are working blood comes out from the artery, then close it up with the knife, or fill the place with wax: and tighten your hand, until the blood stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If there is nothing of them present with you now, then place your finger on the spot, until the blood has dried up.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And moisten the place with water of coolness, until the sharpness subsides, and bind it according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is lighter and easier to extract the artery, that is, as if cutting with this cauldron having two knives: so that the sharpness of the two knives is like an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Since if they are sharp like the two knives, it is fitting that each has coldness: and do not strike flesh with velocity.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	But since there is a little coarseness in them, heat from fire is held in them, and flesh is severed quickly: thus this work is better in every way, lighter, and easier to do.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And there is a space between the two knives which is the quantity of coarseness of the finger, after you have marked the two spots with fire: and place both of them on fire well, until they come to the tip, and strike only in the two spots: that what is between their extremities may be increased.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	Since they do not congeal deeply with this cauldron.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cauldron.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	In terms of the care of sharp, painful, and burning tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are persistent and the course of the tear-ducts from the eyes is on the outside of the skull: and there is no benefit to this remedy with the medicines of physicians, and the face becomes red as it walks, like the walking of ants: and his eyes are exhausted, moist, so that his hair has been corroded with corrosion: and his eyelids are heated with the heat of the tears: then the ancient people were accustomed in this cure, and called it Ense's Cure.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, so that you instruct the sick to shave the hair on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut three slashes in the forehead that are evenly spaced according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of each slash be almost as long as two fingers, and let one slash be evenly spaced from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and let the second be at about the same length as the movement of the lacertus, and let the third be from the other side: and make sure you cut the arteries that are on both sides; and extend your hand out from the joint of two jaws, and let the space between each slash be the amount of three joined fingers; and have you prepare a sponge fragment or many dry cloths with which to soak up blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the spatula from both ends, whose subsequent form is as follows:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is from the temporal side to the second incision: and scrape off all the skin that is between the two incisions with a blade, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this spatula and insert into the first incision again another tool called a sharp chisel, which is smooth on one side and acute on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And this is its form: and place the sharp side against the attached flesh along with the skin, and the smooth side against the bone; and push it until it reaches the middle slash: and cut off with it all the tools that descend from the head to the eyes: except that it continues the incision as far as it appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same in the middle slash to another slash.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when an equal amount of blood has flowed, express the clotted blood from the frond.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every slash a strip of cooked leather, and place on them wicks soaked with wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And watch out so that there is no fever.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, حل the ligaments and administer a lot of infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat that wound with the basilicon ointment, and with the other remedies for wounds: until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	De cure of acute lacrimation and cataracts on the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When any acute, biting, persistent lacrimation or cataracts occur on the eyes from within the head; and the eyes are weakened, pale, and their appearance is already dim: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out of them, and there is a sharp pain in the deep part of the head, causing sneezing: then remove these accidents, for those materials do not come except from many causes.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is as if he shaves his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut into it a fissure in the middle of the forehead, or somewhat more along the length, and begin at the fissure from the left time to right: and go down to the bone: and extend your hand from the temporals that move during chewing: until it is detected the bone: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the fissure with cooked old cloth, or with linen liniments.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tighten it from above with flour: and immerse the flour in wine and oil so that a hot puss does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve it, and you see that the hot puss is about to come out: then you must stop the flow of blood, until it begins to form a nose.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat the man with dry regime that makes the nose grow: as if you took two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from them, and administer it to the birth of meat in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	De cure of him who falls in gold.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that goes into gold is one of four kinds: either mineral stone, or a similar rock, such as iron, and all other metals; or it is from a plant, such as beans, and peas; or it is a liquid substance, such as water, and vinegar, and things like them; or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	But when a stone goes into gold, or any kind of stone that does not contribute to gold and does not grow in gold, expose it to the sun; if you see a stone, then distill into gold some of the oil that has been cooked, or the mustard seed.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction and make it steam with vinegar, and polishes your ears towards the sun at the time of steaming, after you have put on the cloth around the ear, or wool, and extend the ear towards the sky.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	This is often done with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not respond to this treatment, then administer the extraction with gest, that is, with subtle piggy fat: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If it responds well to gest, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction with a little bit of caustic powder: its form is this.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	But if it does not respond to this, then make a tube of brass, and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole a lot, and polishes that is around the tube with soft caustic powder mixed with oil, so that there is no steam going out of the ear unless through the tube: then extract it with your strong steam.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	This is often done with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not respond to this way either: then take from the hair-bath, or from the water, that is, with gluten prepared, which is used to wash the hair, with which they wash their hair, and put it on the end of the hair comb after you have turned your head to one side: then insert it into the ear with ease, after you have dried your ear with a towel.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If then he does not leave with all that we have related, then approach to be split, before it happens poultice warm, or spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of the wound is, that as the phlebotomist takes away blood from the head first: and then draw out from it according to the measure of his virtue.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick one sit between your hands, and turn his ear to the upper part, and find a small hole in the base of his ear next to his fat at the depressed place: and let the hole be lunar-shaped, until you come to the stone; then take it away with that which is possible for you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then follow the wound at once with your speed, and attend to it, until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	That if the thing falling into the ear is from one grain, which grows and swells: then administer extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you to the exit, then take a thin spatula, subtle, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting away of that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not consider that grain already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it off by many blows: then take it out with a hook, or with a gentle hand, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it is facilitous.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In water which is put into the ear, it is necessary that he should use sternutation with condiments at first: and already it fills his ear with some of the old water: and it lies on that ear where is the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then he leaves through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, light, soft, and heat them with fire a little, and introduce one from them into the hole of his ear: and let it come out at the bottom of his foot on that part, and hit against a stone with another stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, cease not doing that with stones and with stones, until he has gone out entirely in water.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now he has gone out so, that you take from the firebrand, or from the cart one, and insert the end of it into the ear: and you light up the other end with fire, until it is well burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the same with another cart, and do this many times, until he has gone out entirely in water: and take it out with a tube according to what has been said before in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extraction however of an animal that is entered into it, if it is a small body, like a piglet, and similar to it: be careful of the body as I have said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body, which seems to the sense: then administer the extraction of it with gestures and a hook: and the work is easier for all that hold in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	But in extraction of a foetus in the ear, when you take care of it with that which we have said in division, and in the book on distillation, and your care does not avail: then you should look into the ear with your finger in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	But if it seems there anything of the foetus, then extract it with gestures, or with a thin hook.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if anything does not seem there, then take a tube, which has this form, narrow below, wide above: and insert the end into the ear according to the quantity that it bears up: and then suck it with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times, until all the foetus have gone out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to the exit, then you should cover around the tube with wax, like I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	Which if they do not go out with that which we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancient ones have already used in the treatment of foetuses: and you will find it in the book on distillation.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your oil and medicine flow out with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see that the face is made of silver, or brass, lower part is rigid, in which there is a small hole, upper part wide.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So it should be as you drive what is in the concavity of the cannula, should be made of brass slightly twisted.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you want to take the radiation, and rub it with a cotton ball in a decent involution: then pour oil, or juice, or what you want from these medicines into the cannula: and let it sit in the ear: then insert the radiation with the cotton desuper, and squeeze it with your hand tempered, until it drives out the oil in the concavity of the ear, and feels it inside: and that which is infused in the ear, should already be warmed a little with fire: and beware there is no medicine that tolerates this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of ear infection with gold.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When some children leave from their mothers' wombs not pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happened to some people that there is an ear infection in the jaw bone, or born of the flesh in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this infection when it happens in the deep cavity of the ear, which does not result in hearing: and when it sometimes happens to the external foraminis a little, and results in it hearing.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	So that which happens in the deep cavity of the ear, and what is not understood by sight, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which results from hearing, you should put gold in the sun, and look into it: then if you see that there is an infection appearing, open it with a fine awl, whose form is this that follows, has some small width, some of its parts are sharp: and the other end of the awl is made of two sides soft: so as not to hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If then a swelling is born in the meatus auris from the flesh: then hold it with a delicate hook, and cut it easily with a sharp scissor, until all the flesh is taken away.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	That if a swelling is in the deep meatus auris: then take a thin ray, a wisp, and heat it slightly with fire: then put it into the meatus auris.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If then you feel a swelling with it, that it is with the weight of hearing weakened: be careful to open it easily: and carefully, so as not to wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put into the ear a wisp according to the quantity of the width of the foramen, which you have introduced into the Egyptian ointment: let it remain for several days, until you are certain that the swelling is healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a wisp and dip it into rose water, and powder it over the swelling, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	That if you see the ear already blistered: then it is necessary to take out the wisp, and let it with another wisp that you have introduced into the green dye which you made with rose water, until the blister cools down: then take care of the swelling until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If then there is a flow of blood: then dip a sponge or cloth into cold water and put it on the ear: and continue with the remaining cure, which stops the predicted flow of blood in the treatment of distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	De cura Altheli palpebrarum.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	This is from the Latin translation of the 10th-century Arabic medical textbook by Albucasis: "Althelil which occur in the eyelids when they are moist and dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary that you hold them with tenails: or with a hook, and cut them with a sharp knife from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then put on the places powder.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If then there flows blood from them: then burn them with a thin lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them, it is better after an incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they run away when some of their roots remain.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned up, and they do not run away.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of eyelids.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	This often happens in the eyelids that there is something which hardens and becomes tough, and for this reason it is called Granum; and it is an aggregation of moist gross matter in the upper lid and lower lid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	So the operation on them is to consider then, if there is Granum proceeding out of it, which appears from the eyelid, and moves on all sides, and its substance is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find then over it a groove across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape off the skin from all parts with ease until it bleeds.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it by a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if you are not prepared to cut it off, unless after you have made a slight incision in the eyelid, then it will hurt you and weaken that spot.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the groove is wide: then aggregate it with a stitch: and take care of it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, do not cause a bad appearance from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The wax will restore it and turn it into flesh again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if Granum is falling into the inner part of the ear towards its surface, then invert the eyelid and hang up the Granum by a hook: except that you cut it off with an incision and press it on all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the lid is elongated by an incision, then it will not hurt in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of Granum with salty water: and take care of the place where it is turning red, until it heals up.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a sweat that is generated in the tunics of the eyelids: and it often happens to boys; and it weighs heavily on their eyes, and they get cataracts in the morning, and they cannot look at sunlight, because their tears run towards them, and because of this their eyes lie on their faces all the time, and fall asleep, and their eyelids are wet with sweat, which has now been dried up: and there is a noticeable Axirnath in the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the mode of his operation is, that he should put the sick man's head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen cloth and prepare it with a line, and make from it a circle of the second size that contains the axilla from all parts.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place him on it and squeeze him with your fingers from all sides so that the axilla is compressed in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of his body with a wet spatula incident cracks across the width, and there is no larger crack that is made in phlebotomy in the deep.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it should be that you find the entire skin, until you reach the axilla, for in many dispositions the axilla comes out of the crack in the form of a white scale.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Then remove it with the cloth that you have soaked between your fingers to the outside: and you shall move your hand to the left and right until it spreads out: and carefully, do not add to the crack, so that you do not reach with a spatula to the eye, and let go of it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if the axilla does not appear to you at first crack, you shall add to the crack a little bit with ease, until the axilla comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then remove it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloth in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and squeeze him with flour.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people who grind salt, and put it in the crack, so that what remains of the moisture is liquified.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if it happens in the place of a hot swelling, then take care of the person with bandages made soft, until it heals over.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Regarding the methods of Ataxmir for the eyes: that is, when the eyelids are made soft to the eye, from which it comes as if it were a pull: and so should not be.
Caput XI.	Chapter
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When they grow in the eyelids of the eye hairs added beyond their course under the natural hair, and grow out: then they are hurt to the eye, and make the causes of afflictions, such as continuous tears, and softening of the eyelids, and scaling, until it is the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir also cures the eyes according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by means of cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, according to that which was said in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir cures by means of incisions and sutures.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with canes, according to that which I say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then with your left hand turn the eyelid of the eye.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If then it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert your finger in there, in which sits the hair from the lower part of the eyelid, and let it penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be next to the very hairs themselves, that is, next to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow out: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it upwards with a ray.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner side of the eyelid beneath the hairs added with a spike incident from the greater tear to the lesser tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread, and put under the eyelid a small piece of tow or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with encaustic, which is like a figure of a leaf of myrtle.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it must be that the figure is made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies very much in human beings.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From these, there is one who needs to be incised from the eyelid a great quantity, according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spike find on two lines which you have marked, and begin from the greater tear to the lesser tear, and let there be a groove next to the natural hairs, as is the girth of a ray.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert a hook into one of two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape all of that.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then join with a suture the two lips, with an aiguille and a thin thread: and wipe away the blood, and let adhere what overflows from the hairs on the two eyelids, with some viscous things, if you wish to do that: and if not, I don't cure it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let go of the suture and thread it up to three days, or four: then take care of that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if there is a wound, let go of the suture and leave it alone, and take care of that with it, which dries up and tightens itself.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid should be away from the wound's sealing and its aggregation: but the future is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	In this way of treating Ataxmius taught the ancient doctors.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	But there is a concern about the sick person, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another way is with Ataxmius too: and that is, as signs on the eyelid, which are like a leaf's figure, as we have told.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then wash the eyelid with three separate or gathered hooks, according to this form which follows, then cut off what is in excess with small scissors, according to this form, with an equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if you cannot hold the hook, and it does not fit: then take in hand where the thread is, and put it into the middle of the figure: and put another thread next to the tear' eye, and a third thread next to the smaller tear' eye: and gather the threads between your fingers with an equal gathering.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then wash your hand with an equal washing: and wash the skin over which is marked the cot, as we have told.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and take care of that, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if there should happen a wound' crack or hole in your incision, or your hole: but that crack with green things, and these like it, from an ointment sitting.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when ever there is a eyelid, so that its hair turns round.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore you should use in it what we have said in the incision: but the suture is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	De cure Ataxmius with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, as you turn the eyelid over, and cut off the crack which is within, according to what we have told.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two canes or two thin woods: the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelids, and their width should be less than the width of a spatulum: and you have already incised on the extremities of each of the two parts where you hold the thread.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then bind together each with care on the part that goes beyond the eyelid of the eye, and tightly press together the two canes from both sides by means of a strong strap, and leave it for a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is tight and will die and decay, and rot, until it falls away by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then there is a delay, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When then has it hardened, remove the eyelids: and the hairs do not sting.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two canes which you shall make according to this figure, and as regards quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Regarding the raising of the stinging hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this is so that you take an acute needle, and insert it into the thread of silk which is fine.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then bind together its ends with a single knot of fine thread: and make the length of the threads the width of a palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose on top of the two threads another fine thread under them, and bind together their ends with a single knot if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place the sick person's head in your lap, and bring it near to the light so that the operation may be declared: for the operation is subtle and minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the linement into the root of the eyelid, and make it enter quickly into the eyelid until it comes out again through the natural hairs.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up above the linement: and insert it into the linement; if there is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the linement in the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If, however, the hair has been torn off and does not come out with it: draw the hair out from below with a thread that you have prepared in it until it comes out of the upper opening, and cut off the hair; then remove both of them, and shut the eye: but release it after two or three days, until the hair has grown back into place, and has grown on top of the flesh.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	That if the hair is short, then either join it with a long hair from the natural hairs, and draw it out with it: or release it, until it grows longer in space, and then draw it out.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of an injury to the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Head XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When it happens to the eye, this is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Al-Alxatri is either natural, or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	So the accidental one is caused by the congestion of a wound, or a cut, or a caustic, and like things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in it is, that you should find the congestion, and that you separate its lips, and place in it what is between them a bit of linen, and bind it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary that you should use in its treatment the things which dry and tighten: for if you do so, it will return worse than it was: but use in it the things which soften, such as foenugreek; and dunk with water, in which has been boiled althaea, flax seed: and anoint with it a little oil, and apply a poultice made with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you should guard against all invention, so that it does not become congested, according to the form which it had in the beginning.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is only a certain correction of Al-Alxatri, so that it does not return to the form of the place at all.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of a bump on the lower eyelid, and it is a rumpling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XXII. On the treatment of a bump on the lower eyelid, and it is a rumpling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This of Alxatri which is done below, is that which is truly called Alxatri.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is caused by a wound, or a crease, or a scar, and the like.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the route of operation in it is, that you take an acorn, in which there is a double filament, and you hold it in the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the filament reaches the two ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upward with a sharp instrument, and cut it with a chisel from the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns according to what is needed, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a radium, and put it in the crease, and turn it with it the eyelid: and find two creases on the inner side of the eyelid, and their ends are from two angles of incision, until they meet and make the shape thus: and when they have come together let them form this figure, and it is a Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then take away that flesh according to the amount, which is the acute lower side of it, from the one that follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather together the separate parts: and sew them with wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what I have said, concerning soothing medicines, and liniments, until they are cured.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the Alxatri happens from a crease, and stitching, or caustic: then you must find a flat crease under the eyebrows, also according to what preceded it.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with a liniment, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the whole discourse on the treatment of Alxatri, when it is upward, or downward, is that it runs according to the operation, according to what is prepared from the form of Alxatri.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is diverse in form: and the prudent workman prepares his mind with any means that may be fit to bring the form back to the natural form, or near to it; and himself also infirm, according as may become him from the operation and instruments, in divers ways.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	The adhaerentia of the eyelid with the conjuctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV: On the attachment of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this consolidation happens to many persons, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents itself from its natural operations:
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Then you should insert the tip of the radius under the eyelid, and lift it up; or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a very fine scalpel, which is not sharp in cutting the sclera, nor somewhat blunt: so that the infirm may not be disturbed at the operation, and remove the scalpel, and hurt the eye with its keenness: and make your incision as if you were taking away that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and heals the whole adhesion.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour into the eye the salt water, washing it with water; or distill into it from a distilled liquid, dissolved from zinc with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with linseed; and place on the eye wool immersed in alum, and after three days use the distilled liquid, and also with solids, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI: On the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears.Incisio enim unguibus non est, nisi ut superuntur ungulæ ad carnem lachrymarum; cumque superant, et tangunt carnem, ita ut lachrymae non possint effusis in os: sed si superent secum, et non tangunt carnem, lachrymae effusi possunt in os.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You see that the incision of the nail is not made, except it is so placed over the flesh of tears; and when it lies there, and touches the flesh, so that the tears cannot flow into the mouth: but if it lies with them, and does not touch the flesh, then the tears can flow into the mouth. You should know that the nail has two aspects.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	It is a nerve: and it is similar to the hard siffac substance, delicate.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not a nerve: and it is similar to the white frozen humidity: which when it touches iron, or is taken with a hook, comes off, and does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both species do not begin until they have come from the larger tear, until they have slowly come to the point where they have covered the vision, and prevented light and eye movement.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the mode of operation in incising it is: that he should put his sick head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and raise his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take a small hook with a little hook of little use, and extend it towards the top.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a pin, and insert it in it from the horse's hair, and pierce or twist: and make the thread strong, and double its end slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and bind it with the thread on the nail, and extend it towards the top: and scrape it with a hair of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with a hair until it reaches its tip.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then incise the remnant in the root of the tear with a sharp knife, or with small tweezers: and let go of the natural tear meat, so that the tear stream does not run because of its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with a hook alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with a soft knife, whose shape is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful, so that the scraper does not touch the horny tunic, and does not cause a tear, and pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, pour into the eye some crushed salt, or make a paste from the ash of herbs, and let it rest until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the eye with what is necessary, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nerived, and you cannot put your tool into it, nor cut the nail, then this kind of nail wound should be treated often with medicines, and it will heal as told in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to cut into it, then open the eye of the wound and take a sharp, thin, dull, mild instrument, gentle in its sharpness, like this one.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And pare the nail from top with subtility.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it itself is rarified and contracted, and presses on it with the file, then distil from your hand into the eye a fluid made from ground pepper, or red pepper, or salt that has been ground: and cover the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat this operation again and again until you have completely removed it.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot puss in your eye: for then let go of that, and deal with the puss until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on the nail with the file until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	Except that the flesh of the eyelid hurts very much, if it is suspended with a hook, and cut from that side: and do not make the last cut, so that the course of tears does not run.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then distil in the tears ground pepper, or made from cayenne, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Regarding the incision of the aluin and the flesh that has grown in the eye:
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	It arises when there is a red flesh in the eyes of some men, either placed above, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or tightens it on the eyelids, and possibly turns the eyelids outward: and it is absorbed into the pinkie.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also that he should put his sick head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open the eyes of it, and take all that flesh with a hook, suitable for it: and hold it with one pair of pliers, or grasp it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until the whole of it is finished with the incision.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And let the eye not be damaged, so that you do not hurt yourself during the operation: and let your incision be where you incise it, or with a spoon, which we have described in the incision of the nail: or with small pliers, with which Abel is gathered, according to the form of it after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your incision is complete and all the flesh has been removed, then wash the eye with crushed salt: or distil into it red powder, and such like from medicinal corrosives: and put on top of the eye a woolen cloth with Albaquine, so that it is protected from the hot vapor.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	That if any of the flesh remains, and a hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot vapor: then let go of the eye, and take care of itself with what soothes it when the vapor has settled.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on the flesh, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do likewise with the meat that has been added which happens to the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you do not apply any cure to a weak eye from natural or accidental cause, operating with fire: and do not put your hand into any of these operations, until it has been closed, for that member is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	De collectione Sebel ex oculo.
Caput XVIII.	Collection of Sebum from the Eye.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	There are red sebum that grow on the eye, which prevent it from an operation: and weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary that you first consider, if the eye in which Sebum is, is strong, and there is no kind of disease in it, except for Sebum: then collect Sebum from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And let him put his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then hang those sebum with a single hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be thin, according to this form, or may be there be two hooks on one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then gather those fine forcipices and those fine new veins with subtlety, and wipe the blood away hour by hour until those new veins have been removed from the eye, and have healed over; and do not leave the eye with the spatulilla tips.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day, and be strong in your operation, that you do not fall except on those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have emptied it, then pour into the eye siefe viride or red: that its own sharpness may corrode what remains of the scar.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If you are not able to gather all of that in that hour, then patch the eye with something that soothes the pain of the eye: and dismiss it for a few days, until the pain of it is gone: and protect it from the heat of the sun: and then repeat on top of it the same way, until it has healed over.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the forifice.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	De reductione Arissati ad nasum.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctors say that the Arissati Fistula, which is in the nose, should be reduced with a caustic or an acute medicine, according to what went before in his narration.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you find out about the discharge at the birth of it, and drain out all the moisture that is in it, and the pus, until the hole is revealed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When, therefore, the hole has been revealed, and there is corruption or blackness in it, then scrape out that with an instrument, whose form is this:
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the asper of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron and let the head be round like an asper, so that it is dotted with the file's dots, or with the dots of a fine awl: and place the asper on the site of the corruption of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll the asper between your fingers and press your hand down upon it, until you know that that corruption is now shaved: and do it sometimes.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with dry poultices of strychnum.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	But if the place has healed over and a bone has formed within it and the wound has closed and does not break open again or suppurate or become infected: then you should know that he is already well.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no hope, unless you reduce the fistula to the nasum, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, so that you can grasp the second bone with a pin, or with sharp medicine: and when you have discovered the bone, then seize the terium according to this form, let the end be sharp, three-sided: and let its wood be an elongated pyramid up to the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the lacrimal: and stretch your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the pin, until it enters the bone, and feels pain: by this you will know that there is a feeling of heat when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	So then restore the place with drying poultices of strychnum, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	But when the bone has formed and the place has hardened: then the substance which flowed outward returns to the nose: so it is lighter on the sick one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	De reductione eminentiae oculi, sicut docui te.
Caput XX.	Head XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye emits its whole essence, and no injury happens to the vision or decrease: then you should let go of the sick one: then bleed him: then put vaporous poultices on his cheek without scraping, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place over the eye a liniment made of acacia, and aloe, and myrrh, and saccolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tie the eye down above a plaster with many powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and double all the cloths together on four: make them many: then place them one over the other, according to the quantity which the eye requires: then tie them strongly together with a hard cloth, with a strong knot.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again, flowing with suctions without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the flowing ones, and release the tight one day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the ligament again softens, then it should be tightened a lot: then remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	But if you see that the eye has already healed with the new skin, it is good: and if not, then again apply the paste, and the dust, and the tighten, and the flowing ones, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Regarding the incision of the skin.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture has occurred on the skin of the eye, then let it be cut and go outside the eyelids as a grain of sand does, and join it to the shape of a man because of this, and let it be pushed into the root of the eye from the lower side to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another one where there is a double filament on the side of the lacrimal, and let it penetrate: then release the first one according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place where the double filament is, and bind a part of the eye to the root with a thread: and tighten it a lot.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove it now, and put on the eye wool soaked in the white of an egg: and release it, until the filament with the eye drops.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the eye with it, that it may comfort itself, until the sore heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the eye is tightened with a circle of cloth from all sides, until it adds a great prominence to the eye.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a thin awl that reaches to the depth of the eye, and wetty white of the eye runs down, and the eye drops down, and enters immediately: then tighten it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Regarding the treatment of Almohad.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease called Almohad, is not except for being a lump that is gathered in the eye, similar to water dropping down, and it itself is not.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation with it is, that you make the sick person sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you see that he is coming to a state of health before your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then tighten it, and do not let it fall down, and release the light: and let the sick person see things as he used to see them: and if it does not go down, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If the descent is not prepared for the sick person with him as I said, then make him sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin spatula, and find with it on the top of the horny flesh a little bit near the junction with the coral skin at the crown, until the disease comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it has come out, then distil into the eye hot water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled hayseed and honey: and then treat with the remaining cure, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Regarding the care of the water that comes down into the eye, or a waterfall.
Caput XXIII.	Head 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken about the kinds of water, and that which is suitable for cutting out with a 선언 and explaining it: then take the same one again according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands square-wise, opposite to the light, near the sun: and tie his healthy eye, and tighten it well: then with your right hand close the eyelids of his eyes, since the eye in which the water is is the left one: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand an alum, if the eye is the left one: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the alum near the crown by the thickness of the radius in the same white of the eye apparent tear: then push the alum with force: and you will feel, that the alum has already come to the state of dripping: and you will see, that it is coming out into the bag of the eye.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	It is necessary that there be a measurement of the route of the Almagbad to the depth, a measurement of space which is from the pupil until the end of the blackness; and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in itself in the pupil of the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the membrane of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the Almagbad until the place where is the water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it itself with a firm push after another one.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then has descended the water immediately, then at once it sees that which is open its vision immediately, and the Almagbad in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then has descended the water, then put it second, except that it exits the Almagbad.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When then is formed, and does not rise: then remove the Almagbad with ease: and you bring back your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in the water some of the salt clear of the jewel: and wash with it the eye inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside all the eye stub, or wool infused oil and wax: and bind with it the eye healthy.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we and those who are our time, put on him the powder ground with wax:
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	That if it does not obey you the Almagbad in the entrance to the eye because of its hardness, since it is of a man, whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take the powder called Alberid, which this is its form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Open then with it the union little only, and not at once your hand in the hole: and is there is not but that you do make the eye open to the place of the Almagbad fine.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the Almagbad, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the complement of your work, is prepared sick bed to be done, in which sleeps on his back in a dark house: and is forbidden all movements, and a cough: and put food for him that which nourishes nature: and does not move its head to the right, nor left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the second ligament be placed according to its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then unfasten that in that dark house, and test his vision: and make him look at things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it should not be necessary for him to make that journey during the period of recovery or immediately after the incision: but rather, he should keep away from it, because the blood quickly rises through the rapid moving eye.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if it happens that there is a swelling of heat: then it is necessary that you unfasten the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with him when he sits down, so that the swelling subside, until it has subsided: then restore his vision, and place over his eyes what keeps his vision open for a few days, while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him leave the house little by little, and let him turn around in his bedroom.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And you should know that the pupil is not exempt from vision when it comes to the student: then he should dare to look at the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed it has come to our ears from some of those who are from Al-Ahl-Ya-Shuhri that a man was pierced with an arrow in Al-Aylah, so that the blood comes out.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But verily I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that: nor is it written in any of the old books: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the eyes from the magic, so that they stand on top of those who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from pure brass: and let their ends be with this same subtle triangle shape, and the acute end.
Formae magda.	The forms of magic.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	About the care of the birthmark that is born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When and because different types of flesh grow in the nose, some of which is similar to the flesh of the scorpion of many feet: and from that same is the flesh of cancer, lead-colored, black: and from that same is the flesh of the sloth, not lead-colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If any of it remains after having cut it away with a sharp and fine instrument, then you should cut it away with another sharp and fine instrument until there is none left.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood is dominant over you, or if there is a fever: then oppose it as necessary: or if it is from malignant pustules, then approach it with cauterization, until the blood stops flowing, and all the flesh is gone.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then, after incising with vinegar, or water, or wine,
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	if it opens and moisture proceeds from it all the way to the palate, then you should know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate, as necessary, then you should know that there is flesh born within the upper bones of the nose, to which the incision instrument does not reach.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then you should put a thread of linen with some thickness, and make many knots in it, and place a quantity of the finger between each knot, or less: and the sick person should let one end of the thread hang down into the nose with a hairpin, or with whatever is possible for him to do after he has done it himself similarly: and he should pull his odor at the same time until it reaches the palate, and he should get rid of it into his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And this is often done by boys in school: and it is an easy task for him who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then you should place the two ends of the thread, one end that has come out on top of the nose, and the other that remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then, as for the surgical treatment of hernia, with the help of a thread tied around the navel, cut through it, and remove the hernia.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Then do this until you know that the flesh has already become attached to the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread: and put into the nostril after the stopping of blood that you drank in the Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has completely eaten away all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put in the end of the matter in the nostril with a lead cane, for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If, however, the cure does not proceed as should, then use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the purifying of the head, when it is distilled with oil, and other medicines in the nostril, make it of silver or brass: which should be like a little lamp, opened as it were a shell-fish: and its opening also.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a cane closed, like a cane.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for purifying the head should be full, closed: which has a handle at the end, so that you can hold it in your hand, when you heat it with oil, or what you wish to apply and fluid things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	## Of the cure for a nosebleed.
Caput XXV.	Head XXVII.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	The ulula often begins to form in the nostril, and it grows bigger, and increases with the days, until it is as large as a fawn's head.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this, at the beginning of its appearance, you should cut off all that part.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put on top of the place, or a cautery, or medicine that burns where it is.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, then, the incision is delayed until it has grown bigger, then consider it, if it is of stone, hard, and black in colour, few in sense: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous wound.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For the vision often sees, which has incised the flesh, and great evil happened to him who had it: as much injury as there was on his own flesh.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the apothema is gentle in touch, not bloody in color, and you see that an incision may be made on all of it, then wash the sick person well, and make the incision without fear or dread: and care for the place along with it as it dries up and tightens, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26: On the head.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know That when a break in continuity occurs in one of the cartilage bones, the operation is not very successful, unless in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when it happens to someone that there is a wound with its blood: then add the pain of the wound along with the suture: and care for the person, until he heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the break in continuity of the lips has already separated them, and one side is made whole: then it should be cut out all of its skin from the outside, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then add the two lips with a suture, and tie them tightly, and sprinkle on it dragon's blood and crushed olive oil: and put over the powders a piece of plaster made from lead, or some other hardened plaster: and let the person be tied up for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen him, and change his medicine: and let him go, until they fall off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the person with ointment, until he heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of the suture is that you add the solution of continuity, or with a thread, as we told you about the suture of the eye: or you add the solution with a thread, as I told you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of nodules from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27: On the head.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people have hard nodules in their lips, similar to small grains of grass: and some of them are small, and some are large.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore you should open the lips, and find out on all of the nodule, and hang it by a thread, and cut it off from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill in the space between the incision and the third day, until the blood has stopped flowing.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then soak it with vinegar, and treat the spot with it where there is a stenosis, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	The incisions in the flesh that have been made on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	Head XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	A lot of times a tooth arises above the gum which the ancients called abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore you should hang it by a hook: or hold it with tongs, and cut it at the root, and let the sap flow freely, or the blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on the space between the incision and the third day, or other dry powders, to dry up the spot.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that tooth returns after treatment, as it often does, then cut it again, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Of the grinding of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they aggregate on the surfaces of teeth from within and from without, and between the gums there are rough spots, and sometimes they wear away, and turn yellow, until the corruption spreads to the gum, and the teeth become rotten because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore you should make the sick person sit between your hands, and rest his head in your lap, and grind the meat and tooth, where you can see the nerves, and such like sand: until there is nothing left of it, and likewise do with the blackness, and yellowing, and sourness, and other things until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then that which is in them from the beginning of grinding is taken away, it is good: but if not, then grind them again on a different day, and a second time, and a third time, until you have finished the care in them that you intend.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the teeth respond to different shapes of grinding, and many forms: moreover, that the grinding tool with which the teeth are ground from below is different from the one used to grind between the teeth, according to the shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors are prepared for you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	§ On the extraction of pain from teeth.
Caput XXX.	Chaps 30 - On the Extraction of Pain from Teeth
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary for you to heal the tooth from its pain with all effort, and be careful in eradicating it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	It is not that the tooth can be made whole when it is eradicated: for the substance is subtle; until such time as there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then it should be considered to be eradicating it when it is weak, so that it may grow firm, and be certified by you, the pain-suffering tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many times the pain deceives the weak one, and he thinks that it is in the tooth and eradicates it: then the pain does not retreat until the weak tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the pain-suffering tooth is certified by you, then it should be made a sacrifice on the edge of the tooth with the tweezers, in which there is some virtue, until it has healed the gum from all parts: then it should be moved by your fingers or with subtle forceps little by little, until it has been shaken.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then the places then should be made sore in it with good position, and the head of the wound between your knees: which you held firmly, so that it did not move: then draw the tooth along its length, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If then it does not come out, then take some of their instruments and insert it underneath it from all parts with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If then the tooth is pierced or corroded: then it should be filled with cloth: and you should squeeze it with a slight turn of the forceps, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction on top of it with the tweezers.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it should be, that you should make a sacrifice with scarification around the gum from all parts much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep thy strength, lest thou break thyself, and some part of it remain, and return upon the sick from that malice which is greater pain to him first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, do not do what the phlebotomists do in their haste, and the boldness of their hands in eradicating it, except that they administer what we have related.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For often they bring great sickness upon men, which is more difficult to break than to break, and all the roots of it remain, or some part of it: or as they take it out with certain bones of the jaw: as we have been often testified.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then he is to be covered after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	That if a flow of blood should come from places (for often it comes): then you shall wipe some of the blood away, and fill with it the place: and if not, cauterize it with fire if it does not give you blood.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	Form the pincers should be fine and sharp, so that they move easily in the first place, having long ends, short handles, large and thick, lest when pressed against a tooth they double themselves: they are like the broad handles of an ax, until when you press them together they do not bite one another, nor double themselves: the short ends, and let them be made of iron bar or cast iron bar, straight-ended, and in their ends should be teeth, some of which should enter others, and should clench by constriction, firm.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when they are made into ends like the form of an ear called a cicada, and are strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the Eradication of Teeth, and Extraction of Bones of the Mandible of Fractures.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When, after the eradication of a tooth that is broken, some remains, then you should put it on the cot with butter for one or two days, until it softens: then enter into it with an awl, or a pin, whose ends are made like the ear called a cicada.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	Forma autem haec est forcipum.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The shape of these is like a pair of tongs. Either made like a grater: or like an iron file.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If then he does not obey you at the exit with these tongs, then it is necessary, that you keep on the root, and remove all the flesh, and introduce an instrument which is called a little hook, whose shape is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the length of the handles be shortish, longer a bit: and let it not be dipped, lest it should break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If then the root is removed by this, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to assist with these other instruments, the shapes of which are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first triangular extremity, in which there is some bulkiness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the triangular extremity is slim.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also assist with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which have preceded in the text regarding the preparation of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also sit the handle with this instrument which resembles a large hook, of the shape of the triangular extremity which is bent, in which there is some bulkiness, so that it should not break; and let it not be dipped, lest it should break.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for teeth: and likewise the other instruments do not count; and the skilled artisan, subtile in his art, discovers the instrument himself according to the operation and diseases themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since from the diseases there are many which the ancient instruments did not name, because of the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If then the jaw breaks from the tooth, or from any other bone of the mouth, or is rotten: then examine carefully on top of it in its own place with that which suits it out from instruments and tongs which I have spoken of in extracting the root, and assist with these movements, whose shape is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be some bulkiness in it little by little, so that it is held fast, or touched with it the jaw, and does not move and rub, until the jaw is removed: and restore the place with suitable remedies for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is pus within the bone, then then cut off that bone from the pus and cure it until it is well.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the locking of the prominent teeth on others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32: Of the lock between the teeth.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When prominent teeth do not move in their normal course, they become rotten through the shape of the jaw: and especially when this happens to women and girls, that is, young persons.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if the tooth has come after another tooth and does not fit into its place, or if it is possible to lock it or trim it: then remove it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small chisel, and is made of iron, having a sharp end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And your cut should be deep, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not disturb another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however he is exposed and his trim is sharp: then trim him with a chisel made of iron, whose shape is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should all be made of iron, and the end of the chisel should be small and sharp, like a point on an ace: with which the tooth is trimmed little by little over several days with ease, so that it does not disturb other teeth and falls out: then soften the tooth, and then cut off the tip with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth that breaks off a piece and hurts the tongue: then you should also trim that piece until its sharpness is gone, and make it even: and then smooth it over, and do not hurt the tongue or spoil the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the retention of teeth when they have golden fillings.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33: Of the retention of teeth when they have gold fillings.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the anterior teeth are injured and disturbed by a blow, or fall: and cannot be held fast on it so as not to drop out: and they have treated them with stringency, and the treatment does not help: then there is ingenium in them, that they may be held fast by gold wire: because silver changes color, and腐ers after a few days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let there be a thread of moderate thickness between the teeth according to the quantity it takes up.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the retention is that you take a thread and insert it between two healthy teeth: then tie it with both ends of the thread between the teeth, or one, or more, until you reach the end with the thread up to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then you will return to the texture until you have reached the part from which you started: and tightly grasp your hand with care and wisdom, so that it does not move at all: and the tension of your grasp where you tighten the thread should be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not wiggle.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors: and join them together, and bend them into a loop: and hide them between a healthy tooth and a tooth that has come loose, so that they do not hurt your tongue: then let go of the tension so that it remains tight.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it should loosen or break, then tighten them with another thread and keep them fixed for a long time in this way.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the shape of two healthy teeth and two teeth that have come loose, as you see it.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when one tooth has fallen out and comes to rest in its place, leaving two teeth behind, it should remain as we have described, and does not do this unless the craftsman is careful, skilled, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when one of the bones of the jaw is broken, it takes on the shape of a tooth and is set in place, surrounded by bone as described above, and remains fixed there, joined to the other teeth with a thread that we have described: it endures and is held fast for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the cutting of the tongue ligament under the tongue, which prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When this tongue ligament, which is under the tongue, is either natural, with the person who was born with it, or accidental, from an arrow that has already healed and hardened.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is, so that you open his jaw at the back of his head in your chest, and wipe away his tongue; then afterwards cut through that nerve ligament across its width, until his tongue is released from its hold.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is anything of hard and stiff material and consolidation of the wound: then throw into it a hook, and cut through it across its width, until you strike the ligament, and thus release the nodulation.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And cause not to be a breach in the deep flesh, and strike there an artery, and let there be a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wipe away at the incision with rosewater, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a piece of linen that holds the sick one every night: so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if there is a flow of blood, then put on the spot a damp cloth.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if you are hurt by the blood, then cauterize the place with a piece of burning coals that is suitable for it: then care for yourself with the rest of the cure, until it heals over.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of the wound under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter LXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	And when under the tongue there occurs an aposteme that absorbs a small wound, preventing the natural movement of the tongue: and perhaps it is increased so much, until the jaw is filled up.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is, to open the jaw with the help of the sun: and consider the aposteme.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see that it is a dark-colored pustule, or black, and hard, to which the sick person does not have a sense of touch: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it declines towards whiteness, where there is moisture: then throw into it a hook, and cut it with a fine chisel, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If you are hurt by blood during your operation, then put on the spot a damp cloth, until the blood is separated: and then go back to your operation, until you have taken out all of it with its appendages.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then rub with vinegar and salt; and care for the rest with due care until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	§ On the treatment of pusses in two almonds.
Caput XXXVI.	Head XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When anything happens between the throat that is similar to pusses, which are called almonds, and happen from wind: and are named two almonds: when you consider their cure with what we have said in the division, and do not heal, then reflect.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	But if there is a puss hard, dull-colored, and of little sense: then you should not touch the body itself with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	But if it is red in color, and its root is thick: then you should not touch the body itself with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but leave the body until it is healed.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you pierce the body: or it ruptures by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	But if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then the body should be struck.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in it is, that you consider before your operation, whether the puss of his body is hot and quiet complete, or is about to diminish somewhat: then do so make him sit before the sun, and place his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and let touch his tongue lower with the instrument, which has this form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be of silver, or of brass, that it is thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	But when you press it with the instrument and show me the puss, and a sneeze comes out of it: then take a hook, and fasten it in an almond, and pull it out to the outside as much as you can, except that you drag with it some of the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the instrument, which has this form following.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is joined to the forks: however, its ends are curved, so that the opening of each of them is in a sharp angle of the other: wherefore take care that it be not of iron, or pewter dipped.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then incision should be made with a chisel, whose shape this is.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Sit acuto ad unam partem, non acuto ad alteram partem.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And when you have made an incision on one side, make an incision on the other side following the same shape of the incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if he has a flow of blood, gargle with water in which you have boiled the bark of the oak: or leaves of myrtle, and similar things from astringents, until the flow of blood stops: then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when the apothecaries arise in the throat from one side, besides the two amigdalas.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Then make an incision on them as I have said for the incision of the two amigdalas.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I have already healed a woman of an apothecary that had grown up between her throat, which she choked on, little sense, so much that it was almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed through my throat, and she had already stopped eating, drinking water, and was close to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the apothecary had risen only so much that it had removed two branches, until they came out of two openings in the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Then I hastened and fixed one of my hooks on one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a large piece came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut off where it was caught in the opening of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I made the same thing that came out of the other opening of the nose.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue: and then I fixed the hook on the apothecary: and then I cut off a part of it, and there was little blood flowing from it: so that the woman's throat was completely healed, and she immediately started drinking water, and then she began to eat.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to strike it after a long time: and the scar which I struck followed his place until it was prolonged too much with that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore made an incision through it, and cauterized it between the gums.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore it stood from the addition: then I walked away from her side, and did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the Incision of Scabs.
Caput XXXVII.	Head LXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a catarrh has descended to the scabs, and is incised and long, then it is called the perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a wart.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When you cure it with that which we have said in the division, and the cure does not succeed: and you see that the scar has become cool from it, and is thin: then you should strike it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is gathered together from it is round, and has no length, and is bloody or fawn-colored or black, and has no sense: then you should strike its incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For fear is in it over the weak one.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore you should, when you see her like the white one and like its length, cause the sick person to sit before the sun; and press her tongue with an instrument whose predecessor we have described: then fix a hook in the wart, and pull it down: and strike it with one or two instruments which I said in incising the two cheeks.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not strike it out of it, unless that is added to the natural end without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you strike it out more, you hurt the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we have described in the incision of the two cheeks: and tend to it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the sick one shudders from the incision: then you should use a device in cauterizing it without fear and worry.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the way of cauterization is not with her, except with sharp water; and it is, that you put the head of the nurse in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press her tongue with the instrument which we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you in the chapter of cauterizing, and bind it with a damp cloth not extinguished, and put it on her mouth thick or thin, and fill it with this instrument, which is its form.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Sit the extreme of her where the medicine is placed congealed, like congealed ear-drum.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the wound itself: and the sick man sit lying on his side, so that heal may flow from her mouth from within the medicine, so that it does not go down in his throat anything, and may hurt him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first put on her on the wound half of the quantity of the medicine every hour, until you see it has become gray, and is soothed by the tingling of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take a pill and roll it up on the edge of the ear, and pour the pill with the medicine, and insert the ear-drum with the pill into the tube from above, until it adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Make this many times, until you get the result that you want of cauterization.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let go of her: for she will dry up and fall away after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	Which if you want to drink the medicine again, repeat it: and after cauterization wash off in the circumferency new with the oil, and clean up with it what is in the circumferency of her from the medicine: and let it sit with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And treat outside with brooms, and inside with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This therefore kind of cure is more healing than incisions, and longer lasting from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when it is cured by suffumigation, which is finer than cauterization and incision: for it is cured by the following way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Sumac, and calamentum, and hyssop, and origanum, and rutam, and sseah, and chamomillam, and abrotanum, and similia eis ex herbis: and aggrega ea omnia, or quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it of silver or of brass; and the end that hath the grain enter into the hole of the wound, until the steam ascendeth to the ear-hole, until it be much darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then put it on many times, until it hath grown cold.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And let not this cure be begun at the first coming of apoplexy.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For this cure shall not be made, except in the cooling of his fever; and it is not fit to make it save when his heat hath abated a little.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if you have not this instrument with you, then take a cannulum, and fit the end thereof to the wound, so that it burn not his mouth; for the cortex of the tree doth not allow the steam to burn his mouth; and this is of good cure when there is health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	As concerning the extraction of spines, and of bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter LIII. On the removal of spines and of bones from the throat.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times an item hath been stuck in his throat, or a spine of fish, or some other thing.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is needful that thou shouldest draw forth that which hath entered into his throat, being apparent above the point whereto it descendeth; after thou hast pressed his tongue with an instrument against the light, and shown unto thee what is therein.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if that which hath entered hath not appeared before thee, and is hidden in his throat; thou shalt make the sick man fast from food, ere he digesteth in his belly.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Per chance doth that which hath entered pass forth by way of the bowels.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick man shall swallow a piece of string, or a leaf of lettuce, or a piece of dry bread; or he shall take a sponge of the sea dried up and soft; and bind it about with a thread, then let him swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	And so when he came to the place where the spine is, or the bone, and it was extracted, then he left.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	But if you do not use the instrument with it as we have said: then use this form of the instrument.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be larger than the radius a little, and at its end let there be a curve that he can easily insert into his throat: and let him hold his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And he should be careful with his epiglottis so that it does not hurt him and it is forced with it the bone, or he inserts himself with the doctor's hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But if the sick person inserts it, that is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the thing: and he should push it downward, or he should hold up his hand with the instrument upward, all of this according to the quantity that has been prepared for him until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of blood from the wound.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the leech is treated with it that I have said in the division of curing with medicines, and does not give, then consider in his throat before the sun, or by the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	But if your yawn falls on the leech, then extract it with a small hook, or with subtle gestures.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	That if it is not possible with them: then take a narrow tube and insert it into the wound up to the wound: and then insert into the tube an iron that has been heated with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the sick person refrain from all water for a day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full drink of cold water, and open his mouth to it: and let him move his mouth with it, and let him not swallow anything from it: and let him move the water for one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when he feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if he does not come out with me as I have described, then suffumigate the sick with fumigators, or with an asa as a instrument that I have described for suffumigation.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it will fall off itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in suffumigation is that you take a bowl, in which are placed the branches of the plant with fire: and all be covered with a cover, in whose middle there is a hole: and place the end of the instrument in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the suffumigation, and let the sick person put his mouth on the end of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that it does not come out of the suffumigation until you know that the suffumigation has reached the blood-vessel.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For because the leech immediately falls away.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	Now if it does not fall, then repeat the suffumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person bear hunger, and eat broths, and other things, and do not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	So it is necessary that he should go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument from which the leech is taken out of the throat when it falls on top of the uvula.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to pincers, as you see: except that there is a small opening which enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to a little bird called a "cicosa", in which there is a roughness of a file: and when it grasps anything, it does not let go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Regarding the opening of the esophagus, and its sectioning, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many species of leeches, and many kinds, according to which their remembrance comes: that is one, and one in this book: and they differ in the perforation of them, and in the sectioning thereof out of two kinds.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is a species of leech on itself, and because it grasps from moist things.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The second mode is because of places, in which it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For the injury that occurs in the head is different from the injury that occurs in the anus; and the injury that occurs in a meaty place is different from the injury that occurs at the joints; and each of them has its own judgment according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from the injuries there are those that do not need to be pierced, unless they have matured blood in them, and their completion; and from them are those that need to be pierced when they are raw and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As the injuries that are close to the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when the injury occurs close to a joint and is prolonged, until the decay of what is around it maybe the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corroded: therefore this is the cause of the closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an injury in a main limb; for if you delay the piercing of it until it has matured, it will harm him or damage it through that main limb.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is close to a limb, pierce it then when it is immature: and do not need to pierce an injury that is raw and incomplete, unless it is close to a limb so that it does not decay deeply, and extends towards the inside of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or remains at the end of it so that it does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of piercing an injury, which has matured according to its completion; and it is at the time of the removal of pain, the receding of fever, and the decrease of redness, and pulse, and acuteness of head: and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same piercing in a lower place of the injury, and more prominent; and let the piercing be longitudinally along the body, if the injuries are in the parts of the hand and foot, and in the places of the joints, and of the chordae, and nerves, and arteries, and up to the last in all equal places, in which there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When, however, there is a hemorrhage in the flesh: then it is better that you shall omit the piercing of it, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said before, according to the supplement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus will be prolonged from it, and there will be much corruption and filthiness, and perhaps its lips will harden, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain hematomas are pierced according to the width of the body in necessity: or according to that whereof the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small piercing in hematomas and a large piercing in hematomas, or sections of different sizes according to the size of the hematoma.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are hematomas from which the skin must be closed together: and it happens when it has already been done like a cloth, and has reached its limit, which is already dead: such as that happened to many, as if it were torn, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those that cut by three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And of these is one in which it incises like a figure of a fern.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Such as an hematoma of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And of these are those in which a round cut is administered, and a lunar one, and similar ones from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	In fact, where there is no head, such as are the superficial hematomas, it is necessary that you pierce it with a superficial piercing, or just a flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary that, when the hematoma is large and has already collected a lot of blood, you pierce it so that it does not come out with all the pus at once: but extract a part from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cover the hematoma until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something more of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Perform this frequently according to a gradient, until it comes out: especially if the person is weak of vitality, or a woman pregnant, or a young boy, or an old man decrepitous: for the animal spirit resolves from the animal with the exit of the blood: and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore let this chapter be a great warning.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have made the incision, where you make these incisions, it is necessary that you clean the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	But if there is a small wound incision, or it is a flat section, then you should administer liniment from linen, or with an old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large wound incision, and there are many fissures of the incision, then you should at that time insert liniment into all the fissures, until they have been made smooth.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the wound, or if you have wrapped it around: then you should fill it with an old cloth, or as when the flesh is dry, or is covered with hair: and firmly tie it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then you should throw it away, and take care of that with it what needs to be done with ointment, until it has healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if blood flows during your operation, then you should administer cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked up into it by a cloth: and place it on the site of the flow many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the flow of blood persists, then you should administer a regimen, and a cure, and the powders that are mentioned in many places in this book of ours, and from a mixture.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the cold season, and the wound is in a place of many nerves: then you should pour in powders with wine, and hot oil: and place them on the sites.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer, and the places are fleshy: then you should place powders that have been soaked in water, and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of this cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you should remove the wound, and clean it up, and administer to it what is beneficial for its healing, until it has healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the understanding of the cure of wounds in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the half of the distinction, I have already said about all the aphorisms, which is a way to cure his capitulum singulariter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	§ On the sections that occur on the skin of the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Head 31.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	The small sections that occur on the skin of the scalp are of two species: they are noduli, which are surrounded by tunica, which are sacs: almost like the hen's feathers.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Of these there are some that are thin; and of these there are those that contain a moisture similar to the lime; and of these there are those that contain a moisture similar to the froth and the pulvis; and there are similar ones, and among them are those that are hard stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in all the sections, and in their extraction there is no danger, provided you do not make opposition to the arteries when you are extracting them.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation on these sections is such that you experience it with an instrument, the shape of which comes after this, which is called Intronium, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that which contains moisture, then dry the section according to the length of the superficial section: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line B to line G. And when you drain off the moisture, then remove the skin that contains this moisture, and do not leave anything of it inside.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times if there remains anything of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the wound in egyptian ointment if it is present, and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with the ointment, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For this will eat up whatever remains of the skin.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the application of the egyptian ointment to the wound a second and third time, and if you find it bearable, until you are confident that there is nothing left of the skin, then the care of the wound with the ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the apostema contains a nodule that is large and swollen: then dry it out according to this form, cutting it in the shape of a cross: and throw away the hooks between the clefts of the cut, and scrub it well from all parts: and try your skill in removing the tunica which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if it makes you opposite to the artery, then do what I will tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do likewise in the apostema, if it is hard, from the cut, and cure in the same way, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the cut on a hard apostema is easier: for there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these apostemas which are in the head of certain men, where there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: for I followed over an apostema in the head of a married woman, and found an apostema like a solid and hard stone, sharp, white, which could not be broken: and if it were struck by anything, it would wound itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other apostemas in the heads, apart from these which happen in the heads of boys, and at the roots of the ears, all their sections are superficial.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or put a hole in them always from their lower part, that the course of blood may run to the lower side.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care of them with that which is appropriate for them from cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the section of Struggles in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter LII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These apostemas often happen in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they happen in the whole body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those which happen from them in the neck, there is one kind, and many: and they spring from a common root: and every Struggle comes from its own tunica, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of these Struggles are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For some of them are hard, and some contain moisture: but all of them are malicious, and do not submit to cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that which you therefore see from them a good disposition in the touch, whose color is clear to the near skin, and which moves in all parts, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck or to the soft part or to the artery, nor is deep: it should be that you separate it from the superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line, b. To the line, g. And scrape it off completely from all parts: and extend two skin lips with a hook, or with many hooks if you wish, as we have said in the scalp, and take it out gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And is on guard that it does not hurt the new, or the nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the knife be not acute, that it may not give you pain with the cut, or trouble you who are ill, and you fall into it, for it is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut the new, or the artery, or prevents you from the operation, then put in a wooden peg broken, or some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the peg, and let it go, until the sharpness of the scar is gone, and the peg softens: or he begins to decay.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped by the poultice. So bring it back to your work, until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger, whether anything remains of the strophuli small ones: then cut them off, and clean them off.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	That if it is in the root of a strophulus a large one: then it should not be cut off from the root itself: but it should be bound with a strong double knot, and let it go until it falls by itself without injury.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the peg with old oil, which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If you cut a strophulus all around: then you should gather the lips of two wounds together: and clean them immediately, as soon as you see that there is no余分な余分
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there is excess because of the size of the Staphula, then it is necessary that you understand how to cut off its root and extract it: and administer the stitch which we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And which of the Strophula contain humidity, pierce it with a superficial hole: so that you appear to be the place of maturity of it: and put the hole from him that follows lower in the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation lighening with ointment, and like things, so that it corrodes what remains of corruption, until when you see the scar already healed: then care for him with a generate ointment of flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	§ On the section of the epiglottis from apoplexy within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter LIII: On the head.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancient ones said that this section of the epiglottis, and no one in our land has done it, and this is a writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But if there is a synecdemus, it is necessary that the section of the epiglottis be removed: with the exception that it is not done: because all the nerves and lung are feeble.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot apoplexy in the mouth, or in the throat, or in both mandibles, when there is no disease in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, in order to escape from the destruction which is done from pre-formation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary therefore when we wish that thing, let us fasten the epiglottis with a small circle of epiglottis, or four, sectioned by a small width from between two circles from the quantity, that sits in the section of the sifac and not in the cartilage: and this place is convenient for the section, because it is private of flesh, and the blood vessels are far away from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the doctor is timid, then it is necessary that he extends the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then find the skin, until when it reaches to the canal: remove the blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then cut the soft part that we have mentioned; and this is signified in the section of the canal from the phlegmon that is issued therewith, when it is broken up, and with the dissection of the vocal cords.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And discharge the wound at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour is come in which there is fear of a hernia, two leaves of the skin-flap are gathered together, and it is sewed up itself alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then apply medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it has healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Says Albucasis. The summary of this speech which we have related is that it is not an exposition unless it is made clear that one of the things which are mentioned has now been healed, for the throat becomes swollen when the wound begins to heal, and the sick man rises up above death, and his anhelation rises up towards him; they cut off the epiglottis in order that the sick man may breathe on the spot where the wound is, and save him from death: and for this reason they prescribed that the wound should be left open until the malice of the illness has passed away, and it is a malice of three days, and almost itself; then they prescribed that the wound should be sewed up, and that care should be taken of him until he is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this which I saw through myself is that a maid-servant took a knife, and put it into her throat, and cut off with it a part of the canal of the lung.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to cure her, and I found her muttering as one who is dead mutters.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Then I loosened the wound, and I found blood flowing out from the little wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was therefore confident that she had not cut her tongue or throat, and that there would be no change; but wind came out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore sewed up the wound, and I took care of him until he was well: and nothing happened to the maid-servant except that her voice became hoarse; and she returned after a few days in better condition of health.

¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	¶ De sectione super specią nodorum.
Caput XLV.	Caput XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	Cum sīt dubitatio fāciēns.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Dico ergo, quod cum exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolor uehementis, donec sedat ebulliťio superfluitātis, et completur putrefactio: tūnc enim quiescent fēbris et calor.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	Cum nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis sacium proprium, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaēptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two kinds: either they are thin: or they retain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you are treating a nodule, you should try it out and inquire about it first with the instrument called Intromissum, according to how its shape comes out in the chapter that follows after this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiry about abscesses and all nodules is that you take this instrument and insert it into a moist place where you suspect an abscess: and you move your fingers slowly with it until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then, when you have reached the last limit of the size of the abscess with your hand.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then remove the Intromissum, and consider what comes out into the hole.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	But if there comes out running moisture, whatever its color: then dry up the area by a superficial cut, as I have said for other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if there does not come out moisture in the hole of the Intromissum, then you will know that it is fat: so dry up on top of the area with a shape of a cross, following this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with a hook, and scrape off the skin from all parts with ease: and guard the cruciform shape well, if you can, over it, so that you may extract it sound with a Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the cruciform shape is broken during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it soundly, because this often happens: then remove it roughly, until there remains nothing of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if it remains a little or a lot of it, the Node returns according to many.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	That if it wins you, and remains a little of it: then fill your wound with some powder of acute corrosives: and tighten the bandage, and put it over the spot where the abscess sits that is hot, and take care of the area with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then there is a large nodule, then cut it in two and care for it along with the ingrown part.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however the new one is opposite to you, pulsatile or not pulsatile: then approach, and fill the space that has been opened with dried earth, and leave it bound for two days, or three, until the sinew has rotten, and rest has come to the effusion of blood: then return to cut that which remains from the nodule.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	§ As regards instruments for cutting and drilling.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVII on heads.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	The forms of intromission are three:
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	From them there is a great one, and from them there is a middle one, and from them there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let there be made from iron four-squared extremities that recede from the entrance so as to guide the intromission into the abcess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	These are the forms of experience, and they are three, namely perforations: one is called a bore, that is, a perforating: and they are three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From them there is a great one, and a middle one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They agree that they may be examined by the abcesses, and exitæ, and fistulas, and bubones from him who is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, three-sided, smooth, like the large needle with which the seats are supported, made of amber or of brass or of iron or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better ones are made from amber.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are experiences also of lead, black, which agree in that they examine the fistulas with them, whose edges are soft, so as to reflect themselves by their softness with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And again they are three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Since from them there are long ones, and from them medium ones, and from them short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the strictness of its edge.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of a ring, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For they are simples, that is, those in which there is one length: and there are three kinds as you see, great, middle, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are blind vines: and there are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are hooks having two lengths, and they are three kinds: and from them are hooks having three lengths, and they are three kinds: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	These are the shapes of Scalpel, with which they cut and burn nodules, and sutures: and there are three kinds: for from them is great, middle, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which they make the cut are acute, and other extremities are not acute: and they are not set so as to cut, unless it is to cut into a nodule at the risk of an incision in the skin, or in a nerve: and that it may heal through it by a little burning, rather than by burning off a nodule.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the great, and these are the middle, and these are the small.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of iron, and they are similar to the radio with which alcohol is made: and in the long end there is a hidden pin: and it runs into the inside, and outside when you see it, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the pin which hides between the fingers at the perforation of sutures: and they are not felt by the touch: and there are three kinds, great, middle, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The shapes of the blades with which they cut off a flow of blood: and there are three kinds, great, middle, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of iron, or brass, round, to the length as you see: and let them be subtle.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And let these kinds of blades be with you great, and small: so that you cut off blood from it with speed at the need, and then when there is no medicine present for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them to cut off blood in any part of the body, and do not use them except in tender parts: as with livers of legs, and hips, and wrists of arms, and breasts, and hands, and groins, and similar ones from tender parts of flesh, from tender livers of legs, humerus.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they are made from them small instruments similar to the fistic cortex, according to their form: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or near the incision of the vein, or of an artery; and when they are made from them round ones according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.
Caput XLVII.	De cure mammillarum hominum, quae mammillem mulierum similare sunt.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When and at the beginning of sleep some people's breasts swell and remain lumpy to a woman's breasts.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever therefore loathes this, should he should cut off the nipples by means of a lunar section, according to this form from the line, b to the line, g. And then scrape the whole nipple.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill a wax with an incarnated medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the nipple sways towards the lower part and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it should be found in its two sides at the top with two lunar sections similar in form, each of which is joined with the other at the ends, so that it forms a larger line containing the smaller one, according to this form from the line, b to the line, g. Then scrape the skin between the two lips, and remove the nipple, and administer what we have said about the suture and the powders, which is necessary in the cure, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	But if you do not want to cut it as is necessary to cut it, because of unease or because of a flow of blood: then you should fill the nipple with an浸merged corrosive unguent, and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the nipple.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Regarding piercing of the areolas, which happened under Titus.
Caput XLVIII.	CHAPTER LVIII. ON THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SURGERY.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	CHAPTER LVIII. ON THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SURGERY.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	These wounds that occur below the nipple are of a hard kind of strophula, which contains a sac, and from these are those that contain moisture. Now, since they are of this kind that contain moisture, it is necessary that they be opened with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b to line g; and when all that is in the wound has been drained out completely from the poultice, then fill it again with fresh poultice and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the poultice, and treat it with a suitable ointment for that wound until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the sore is of the kind of nodular strophula, then cut over it, as we have said in the section on strophulas that are equal.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if it extends a nodule so that it discharges pus, then administer cauterization to it, as we have said in that which precedes.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	§ On the Section of Sores That Occur Due to Artery and Vein.
Caput XLIX.	CHAPTER LIX. ON THE SECTION OF SORES THAT OCCUR DUE TO ARTERY AND VEIN.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is severed and the skin that is above it becomes hardened, often a sore will develop from it; and also for the veins, as for that sore and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is recognized that the sore and swelling are due to an artery and a vein, are these: for when the sore is due to an artery, it is long and swollen in the body; and when you press your fingers upon the sore, you feel as if it were full of air.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round in the visible part of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section upon this sore is a mistake, and especially if it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and on the neck, and in many other places of the body; and it is a great mistake.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is therefore necessary that his care should be with iron, and that what is also in the extremities, or in the head, should be operated on.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	On this therefore, since what is also in the extremities, or in the head, has to be operated on, find in the skin's section along its length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with the hook, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is detected.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce a pin underneath it, and let it penetrate until it reaches another side, and tighten the artery with a double knot in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place between the two ligaments with a needle, until all the blood in it has gone out, and dissolve the puss.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure which generates puss, until the ligaments fall: afterwards, treat it with ointments suitable for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If there is a puss because of the section of a vein, then you should hold your hand, as far as possible, away from it while it is coming out with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a pin under the place which you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it remain in it a double thread until you have extracted it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind the puss with a good ligament: according to what I told you about a ligature, from both sides, with its two extremities, of a thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you are going to extract the thread, then introduce a pin with another thread under the puss completely by the incision of the needle: press it down, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the puss from the middle of itself, until it has gone out what is in it: then cut off the excess skin, and let go what was bound to it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on the pulp which you immersed in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure, which is done with ligatures and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	On the apoplexy which follows from a twist of the nerves.
Caput L.	The head.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As happened with the apoplexy in the artery and vein, so it has happened with the nerves; that which has happened in them is a blow, or it has happened from excessive work, and similar things: and it often happens to them in the places of support, or calcanei, and in all places where joints move: and it is a grave apoplexy.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with a pulse, it feels in it a similar dullness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And this apoplexy is not aggregated in the depths of the body, but is under the skin, and itself moves in all directions, and does not indicate toward the front, or before, or behind.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	So, since it is in joints, it should not be moved with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, however, it happens because of contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is from them in the head, or in the forehead, find skin with a hammer.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If then it is a small apoplexy, then hold him with pliers, and cut him off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is a large one, then hang him with a hook and scrape him off: then take it away, and aggregate the knot with a stitch: and care for it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the section of apoplexies which occur in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	The head.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people often have a lot of wind in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, which they call fungi, because of the similarity of these to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of these is thin, and their heads are thick, and their lips are swollen.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is from them a little: and it is from them that it increases greatly.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have already seen a man, and in his belly were two fungi, which were more than other things like mushrooms: there was no difference between them, they had white roots, and their lips turned inward, and they were always moist.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So cut them, and I found in weight one as X and VIII uncia and in the other as VI uncia And the operation in their incision is, then, if weak is damp, and color thelil is albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: then cut him with a broad chisel, and let the cautery be in your presence on fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often expels at his sectioning much blood: so close then if you are defeated by blood, then cautery yourself.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	That if you see weak weak and timid from the incision with iron, then take a thread of lead poorly made, and bind it with him athel: whose way is what we have said, and let go himself two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the constriction of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	So do not cease to bind lead, when it presses on the lil, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without work.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the lil is gross radiceps, then in its incision there is something of fear and fear: above all, because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless, possible is that you cut half of him.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cautery himself, so that he does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for him, until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not suspect to cut the lil that is of a dark color, few senses, foul appearance: for it is an ape-like cancer: and I come with a reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	De cure of eminence of Umbilical cord.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Fit eminentia umbilical cord from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures of the stomach, which is above the navel: and comes out of it lead, or intestinal, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a vein, or artery, according to what has been said above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from constriction of the cord.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is because of a sivac fissure, and the exit is healthy: then it is a color similar to body color: and it is soft, without pain: and appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of the intestines, then its site is with that which we have described, a greater diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	Now when you press the fingers on your own belly, it is hidden away: and then it returns, and perhaps it is with it a rumbling: and it makes itself very evident at the entrance to the bath, and works a great deal of pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is due to humidity, then it is soft, and then it does not get hidden away when pressed with your own hand, nor does it tighten, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	What if it is due to blood, then with these signs appears a black spot at the tip.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is born of flesh: then it is a dark grey, thick, hard, and figures according to the quantity one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if it is due to wind, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, that you should then, if there is eminence of the navel due to blood of an artery or vein, or wind, then you must refrain from curing it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said about apostemas due to an artery or a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	What if the eminence of the navel is due to intestines or gas: then you must order the sick person to hold his breath and stand with his arms spread out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with the caustics around the navel all over.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to lie down between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then with a sponge wet on one side around the navel over the spot you have marked with the caustics.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the pouch towards the top, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him firmly around with a strong thread, or with silk string: and let the knot of the binding be relaxed.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle pouch that has been extended above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you have already found him taken by a ligature: then draw out the alenxotati, and insert the index finger into him, and push the intestine to the interior of the abdomen: and if you find the zirbum, then take it with a hook, and cut off his excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however the contrary is for you, the artery, or the new: then surround him much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two accus, and insert in them two strong fillets: and insert two accus around the one you have made around the apostema in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the apostema in four places on the accus: and if there is a desire, remove the accus, and leave the place, until the flesh extends which has putrefied: and let it fall by itself: or cut it when it thins out and putsrefies.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with the ointment, as is necessary, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	That if there is eminence of the umbilicus out of flesh in him, or out of moisture: then it is necessary that you tighten the apostema, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood, or the moisture, which you have found in him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of the wound with him, as it solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Regarding the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of Cancer, and how it is to be cured with medicines: and to take care from curing him with iron, so that he does not ulcerate: and we have spoken about cancer generated in the womb, and about taking care when curing it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients say, that sometimes cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated: such as cancer in the milk-gland, or the thigh, and similar places, from the body members so as to extract all of it: especially when it is beginning to be rough.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	But when it is curbed, and is great, it is not necessary that you come near it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not heal anyone from it; and I did not see anyone before me who had recovered from it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation, when it is placed as we have said, is, as regards its method, such that you should go before it and heal the sick from black cholera sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomy itself if it is evidently filled with blood.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick with preparation in which the operation is placed.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw into the cancer the hooks that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then wrap it all around with skin, according to the examination, until none of its roots remain: and let the blood not flow, and do not tear it quickly, except to express the places, and wipe away the gross blood altogether by your hand, or with whatever is possible there;
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the opposition makes you flow blood from the incision of an artery or a vein: then causticate the blood, until it is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with the remaining cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Of the treatment of hydropysis.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already spoken at length about the division of the species of hydropysis and how water is aggregated; and we shall now speak about the signs of each species, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured by the use of iron, is not but one kind of hydropesis: and it does not approach the iron of timpanitis: nor does it go deep into the hyposarcous: for that would be fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already tried to treat this species of hydropesis with medicines, and your treatment has not been successful: then reflect.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the sick person already has a general weakness, or there is another kind of weakness along with hydropesis; such as if he has a cough, or a watery bladder, and things like that: then be careful not to treat it with iron: for there is a fear of that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a sick person with abundant strength and vigor, and there is no illness other than hydropesis: and he is not a boy, nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is this, that you should stand him before your hands, and let him express his wind by hand toward the lower part of the pineal.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spike-shaped spatula, shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Take two acute parts, one long, the acute end like a spike-shaped spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, in it there is something that narrows gradually so that it does not interfere with it during the operation up to the intestines and does not damage it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of hydrops on the part of the intestines, then it should be extended with a section of three fingers' width from the umbilicus, towards the lower side directly above the spine.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If, on the other hand, there is a generation of hydrops due to liver disease: then your section should be three fingers' width from the umbilicus to the left.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if that generation is due to the spleen, then your section should be on the right side: and it should not also be located at a place where the sick one will lie, so that there are no fluids going to that weak spot.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin with a sharp instrument completely.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce it into the section, and with your hand, with the spike-shaped spatula between the skin, as if you were scraping it off: and the amount that is scraped should be the size of a nail, or around that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the skin with the spike-shaped spatula until it reaches a vacuum spot: and there is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then pull out the flesh, and introduce into the opening an instrument which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, smooth, round: and at the lower part of it there is a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its end should be incised, following the pattern of the incision of a calamus, as you see: in the upper end there is an annulus.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately comes up on top of the instrument, thus making a small amount of air bubble come up from the water at a medium rate.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you drain from it more than is necessary, perhaps at the hour of death the sick person dies through a resolution of his animal spirit; or something happens to him which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But drain from it according to the power of its virtue, and according to what I tell you about the dispositions of the infirm from the power of its pulse, and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it retains immediately by means of the skin which retains the hole which is above the sifon: of which I told you, that you should do as to that mode.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then remove the instrument on the other day, if you see the sick person bear that thing: and also remove from the water a quantity of the pulse.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that on some days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains in the water not much of a quantity.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are about to treat a sick person, and let go of a great deal of water: then take care of him with the dirt in the hot sand, and with a great sweat in the bath and in the sun, and let him wait on hunger: and take care of him with the medicines dried up, until he is healed: and cauterize over his stomach, and his spleen, and his liver, after the removal of the water: according to what I told you before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Of the care of infants who are born in places of their urinary organs not pierced.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant comes out of the womb of his mother, and the head of his swaddling clothes is not pierced, or a hole is narrow, or is not in its place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Then it is necessary to help with the piercing of him as soon as he is born with a soft sponge gently: according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put into the hole a small slip from lead, and tie him up: and hold him three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When he wants to urinate, let it move, and let it go.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce the child.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead [plumb], it is possible that the urine which has flowed over the place, should not prevent him from closing [claudi].
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he who has a narrow hole, he is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it increases.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the hole is not in its proper place, are wounded.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because from those who are born, the hole is at the end of the penis; so that he cannot urinate forward, until he raises his penis with his hand to the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation in him, therefore the semen cannot reach the womb according to its straightness; and it is a foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the mode of action in that is, that he lies down on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend his penis with your left hand by a powerful extension, and cut the head of the penis from its proper place with an acorn, or sharp stylus; like as you would cut a stalk, or like you cut some hair, so that it may come to resemble the head of the penis, and let the hole fall in the middle, according to what is needed.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And cause yourself to be near during your operation from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So he takes off with him who cuts off the blood, and cares for a wound, until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Regarding the wounds that occur in the prepuce and penis, and corruption, blackening, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These wounds often occur on the penis, and there is a profusion of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it another evil arises, and another not evil.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	So it is not evil that you should hang him with a subtle hook, and cut it off, until you have completely cleansed it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on it a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with the ointment of difinicon until he is well.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the albather is male and of a bad color, then you should administer cauterization after incising it and shaving it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If the albather is caught in the foreskin and is part of it between the foreskin and is outside part: then you should remove the albather that is inside first until it is secure, then care for him outside: because when you care for him at the same time, the foreskin does not heal securely unless it is pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also happen to the testicles, and the foreskin blackened and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should bring together everything that has been damaged, and what seeks to corrupt, or what is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then put a line of honey over the wound that has been crushed with flour of ground corn, and herbs of three times.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with the remaining cure until he is well.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then administer cauterization with lunar cautery, in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cauterization is suitable for two dispositions at the same time, namely for a flow of blood, and when corruption occurs.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If it corrodes the head of the penis and destroys all in an hour: then you should insert a plumbum cannula into the meatus of Praepaus, so that the weak can mix with it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	However, the foreskin adheres to the head of the penis, and this type of adhesion does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required: and when an adhesion occurs due to a wound or aphasia: you should cut it with an obtuse Spatumili until the ligaments are broken, and free the head of the penis from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish it finely, then you should cut off some of the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	What is, because the foreskin when it is thin, perhaps pierces quickly due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and, with a thin linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water so that it doesn't stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat with astringent wine until hardened.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	The purification of infants and the treatment of errors on them by accident.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a remedy for continence, like the other wounds; but since it is of our invention and use, we should mark it as an improvement on our procedure, and make it lighter, leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, that the ancient ones did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: for they do not use it in their laws, and is only because we have acquired it through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is, because I found most of the techniques and the use of bloodletting in purification, circumcising with a knife, and using forceps: and they use leeching, binding with thread, and cutting with nails.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I too have already tried all these methods, and did not find a better purification than circumcising with forceps and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For, in purification with leeching, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the foreskin has two tunics; so perhaps one cuts the upper skin and fears that the lower tunic will tear: so it is necessary to make an incision to cut the latter, and a pain will be expected.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And since the purification done by leeching, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, does not secure an incision at the extreme end of the male member: because perhaps it enters a hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In purification with nails, perhaps the iron blunts, and ruins your procedure: and the skin of the boy is naturally short, and often grows up so that it does not need purification: and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	The Mundification with lances and thread, I have found a good experiment: For the lances are proportional to the incision: since the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	But when you press your hand with the lances, two sharpnesses are proportionate, and incise one at a time in one operation in one time: and it is made by a similar figure compression, containing the skin of the thigh from all parts, so that there is no error at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the mode of operation is appropriate, so that you can estimate, especially if he is from those who understand a little, that you do not make, unless you tie the thread on his thigh alone: and let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then let him enjoy and rejoice in all ways as much as possible for you, since he receives intelligence from it.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then let him stand between your hands prepared to stand, and not sitting down: and conceal the lances in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then put your hand on his thigh, and blow into the skin, and pull it up until the head of the thigh comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from him since it is gathered in her sour:
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the spot marked with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie the lower one with a thread as much as possible as the second one.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index, and keep the place of the lower ligament with good hold, and incise between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then wipe the skin quickly upwards, and pull out the head of the thigh.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better) and put the powder from above: and over the powder, a cloth in which the wool is spread out, boiled in water with rose oil, shaken with oil.
Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Recent good: and let him stay on himself until another day: and take care of the rest of him with the cure, until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the scissors for cleaning is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Now, regarding the design of the surgical scissors, the following is specified: they should have two ends and be curved; their blades should be equal in length to the handle-pieces.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	However, a slip during the cleaning is possible: for perhaps all the inner skin will be shed, or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, you should extend it from your own hand before the examination of the site: and you should strike it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your hand, then remove it with a hook and strike it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If, however, they have passed three days and remain under inflated flesh, an ulcer: then dismiss it until the ulcer has healed by itself, and prepare it easily: and be careful from the head of the tree.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Care for it then with the one that has healed from the poultice, which we discussed in the book on poultices: and if it is incised from the skin above the measure, and extends upward, it will not harm it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Care for it then with that which we have said, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Regarding the extraction of a retained warts from the urethra.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter L VIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retentie of the urine in the urethra, happens from an operation carried out by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or meat born, and similar things which we have said about the modes of curing in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the warts do not disappear, and you see that the retention is because of a stone which is now in the neck of the urethra: then it is necessary that he be cured lying on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then put his feet together on his back, and extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and strangle the patient with his breath as much as is possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It was therefore thought with the neck of the urogenital system for the expulsion of the stone to the rear: why is the urethra emptied?
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	That if it is not solved with it as we have said, and the trouble is a matter of weakness: then it is necessary that you administer the extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose this is its form Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the mode of exit of the urine through it itself is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie the ends with good knot: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and strike with the forceps if there is anything leaking from the wool, truly introduce into the cannula with vehemence, like to raise.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then dip the syringe in oil, or in butter, and in alume: and make the patient sit on a chair, and insert the urogenital system, and his penis with wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double itself over on the upper side from the umbilicus.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into itself until it reaches the bladder, and feel that it has already reached the empty thing: and this is not done according to this order, unless because the opening, in which you insert, is twisted.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the urine follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it, and make the urine run through the urethra: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do this, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient feels relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Regarding the quality of clisterea of the urogenital system with the clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there happens to be an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is confined in it, and water and medicines are distilled into it: then do as with the instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is closed, that is, shut.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side, like eyes.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the place where the impeller is located, which moves it without addition, until when it is drawn with it something is attracted from moisture: and when it is moved, it expels it far away: secondly, because it makes the clepsydra, which throws naphtha, that is, Greek fire in fights.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	So when you pour water into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the water, and draw it out with what moves it upward; for water is drawn into the closed place of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its end into the penis, as we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the water with it because it moves that which we have described as fire: for water reaches the bladder immediately, so that one feels it there.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a thin clepsydra in which the bladder is closed up.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or brass; its head being higher than the rest, and having a space below it where the ligament is fixed.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a sheep, and place moisture in it, which you will distil into the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then fasten it between two spaces with a double knot: and heat it slightly by means of fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the end of the clepsydra into the penis, and then tighten your hand on the bladder with a constricting movement while it goes down, until one feels that the water has reached the bladder: for this water already reaches the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, you do not have a water vessel present, then take a piece of pergament and make a circle out of it, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into these holes, as they rotate.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle together, as is gathered alsofrith; after you have put into it that which you take out of moisture, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument: and make with it as you did with the water vessel by expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the water vessel.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	Regarding the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	I have already spoken in the division of the species of stone, and the treatment of it with medicines; and I have distinguished between the stone generated in the kidneys, and the urinary bladder, and their signs; and I have described the stone which is operated on by hand and section: and this is a stone properly generated in the urinary bladder: and that which is formed in the branch is also my subject; and I am narrating it with a clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I therefore say, that stone generated in the urinary bladder often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is known that the urine which issues from the bladder is like water in its subtlety; and white sand appears in it: and it irritates the man's testicles, and hurts them when they touch it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it stands up, and exits with it the anus in many of its phenomena.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure of boys is easy from that time to about fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	But it is difficult with older people.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But with boys the cure is intermediate, because it is between that time and the time when the stone is larger; and its cure is easier if it is a small one, and if it is large, the cure is reversed.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we have come to the cure, it is necessary first that we change the sick man with the clister, which removes all the dirt that is in his intestines; for he sometimes prevents the detection of a stone by inquisition.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick person be carried with his feet and be shaken and moved to the lower parts so that the stone goes down into the bladder or sometimes jumps out of its place from the top.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then let him sit with his hands prepared between your hands, and his hands under his hips so that the whole bladder may descend towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you then feel the stone in space, then immediately approach it with the cut side up.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your hand at all, then you should clean the index finger with oil from the left hand if the sick person is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a full grown man: and put him in some part of his body, and examine for the stone until it stands under your finger: and turn it slowly towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger and push it towards the external parts opposite to the place you want to section: and have one minister to press the bladder with his hand, and another minister to stretch out the testicles with his right hand towards the top: and let him with his other hand move the skin, which is under the testicles in that part where the section is to be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the probe, which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in him where it is between the scrotum and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the left side of birth: and let the section be made on it so that the stone comes out easily from it, being not very large; and let the section be made diagonally so that it be wide outside, and tight inside.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps your finger, which is in the anus next to the section, will compress the stone; and it will come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from the stone there are angles and edges, so that it is difficult to get out because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is soft, like a gland, and round: and it is easy for it to come out.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, where there are angles and edges, add a groove.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it is not so, then one should have an assistant stand on top of the patient, or bend over the patient with a awkward posture, whose end is as the moon which strangles on a stone and does not slip away from it: or as you would insert a thin instrument under it, with curved ends.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot stand above him, then make the opening slightly larger.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	Since if something is making you bleed, cut it off while it is still alive.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if the stone is larger than one, then push the largest part towards the opening of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a little bit after it, and do the same if there are more than two of them.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	Since if it is very large, then it is not known how to separate it from above with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since this has happened to a sick person from one of two things, or that he should die, or because the urine is distilling often: soon, because it does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But give him a way to expel it until he leaves: or with forceps on the break, until you cut it out quickly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have finished your operation, then fill the wound with thure, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and tie it up, and put a soaked cloth on top of it, with oil and rosewater, or with oil and cold water: so that it may be soothed by the warm poultice.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then wrap the patient up, including their neck, and do not separate the ligaments until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you release him, then soak the place with much water and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with dye-fin-icon ointment, and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if the warm poultice is added to a broken bone, and it is corroded, and there are similar things: such as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented from leaving it: and it is known that this happens when the urine leaves with the blood.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Introduce therefore your finger into the cavity and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if any remains, it invites corruption of the flesh and decay thereof.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the cavity with vinegar, water, and salt; and oppose to it all that is proper from the cure, until it be healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary, during the time of cure of all the body, that the two hips should be bound together, and that the joints should be kept close together, for those medicines which are put upon the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and lies in the meatus of the urethra, and fixes itself there, and prevents the passage of urine; then take care of it with that which is proper before you proceed to the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For often you will find relief from the operation, since I have already tried it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And take the Perforator out of iron, which has this form, a triangular extremity, acute, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and bind it with the limb under the stone that it may not return to corruption.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the limb with ease until it has reached the stone: and remove the piercing with your hand little by little from the stone; and feel the piercing of it, until you have made it pierce from one side to the other.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For urine is at once removed.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the external side of the limb.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it will break, and go out with urine, and the sick one will be healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If this cure is not proper for you, on account of something which prevents it from working; then bind the thread under the stone, and a second thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry up the stone in the middle of the limb between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then draw out the stone.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then solve the bindings, and clean away the congealed blood, which has formed in the arm.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the tendon of the son under the stone, unless he returns to the skin for exercise: and another ligament from above, unless when the tendon comes after the departure of the stone, returns to the skin to its place, and covers the wound; and because of this, you must do this when you tie the upper tendon, that you raise the skin above, that it return with your supplement, and cover the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of a stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI. On the extraction of a stone from the urinary bladder in women.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is seldom formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, a stone should occur in any of them, then the treatment is difficult, and it is forbidden on account of many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is: that a woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is: that you should not examine a chaste woman, or one who has a husband already, under the pretense of medicine.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	And the third is: that you should not examine a woman who is well versed in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is: that the distance from the place of the stone is great: for there is a fear of danger in the deep section, and it is in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	That if necessity compels to do this, then you should take a woman who is well versed in the art as a doctor; and it is rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if, on the contrary, you wish to keep it secret, then seek out a chaste, subtle doctor, and have present a skilled woman doctor in the matter of women, or a woman who is familiar with this part of the art; so do it with her present, especially ask her to do all that you order to her in the inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	In the first place, that she should examine if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she should insert her finger into some part of her, and inquire about the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	And if she finds it, let her hold it with her finger, and then order the obstetrician to insert his own finger into the weakened place, and inquire about the stone, after he has placed his left hand on the skin, and compresses it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If then a stone is found, then it should be gradually moved from the urethral orifice downward with its utmost power, until it reaches with it to the root of the pelvis.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should cut over it at the place of the middle urethral orifice near the root of the pelvis, from whichever side it is prepared and feels the stone in that part: and his finger should not be removed from the stone, compressing beneath it: and there should be a small incision in the first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should insert the ray over that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If then he feels the stone, then he should add to the second section a quantity proportional to the amount of stone discharged from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you shall know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For from these there is a small one, and a large one, and an coarse one, and a sharp one, and a long one, and a round one having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	You shall therefore know the kind of it, as it will be shown to you on this which you wish to understand.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If then blood is drawn against you, then add in the place of the cut a powder of three times, and hold it for an hour, until the blood is separated.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then turn to your operation again, until the stone is discharged from it: and do as you prepare yourself with the instruments, which I have said for extraction of a stone from the urethra, that you may be helped by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If then blood is drawn against you, and you know that the discharge of blood is from an artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place, and tighten it with the powder as it declines: and do not change it: and let the stone go, and do not take out itself.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the woman will die who is weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When then the sharpness of blood is seated after days, and the place is decayed, turn again to your operation, until a stone is discharged from it.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Regarding the section above the hernial region with water.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	Ramel water does not exist, unless there is a collection of moisture in the sifac or skin, which is inside the scrotum: and it is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in the proper pouch of itself, which nature has made in a part of it, until it is put on: that is another thing, and it is the skin of the testicles between the sifac white, which we have said: and it does not do this unless rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this branch, is from the weakness which happens to the testicles: why this substance is spilled upon them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or on the other hand, it is a color that is declining into citrinities, or is bloody red, or feculent black, or white watery, and this is what it is that is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs with which one knows where is the collection of water, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the sifac skin, which we have said, then the aperture is round to about the length of a figure-eight: and the testicle does not appear, because moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the proper pouch of itself, then the aperture is round with a part like it, and for this reason man guesses that it is another thing.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white of the sifac, then it falls down.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the aperture with a square insertion, whose shape preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to this, therefore, when it moves into the insertio's space, judge of it that it is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the cure with the iron, then it is necessary that you send the sick person to bleed if it is possible for him to do so, and you will see his body full of blood.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should lay him on his back upon a hard thing a little, and place under him many sheets.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit to his left, and order the servant to sit on his right, who shall spread out his thigh from one side to the other of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the scrotum.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to the chest: and make the incision according to the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until you reach the white layer surrounding it: and examine the flesh, or rather keep it open, so as to separate it: and sit with the flesh you are examining hanging down on one side more than on the other, and carefully examine it by its quantity that you can see.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the white layer with a wide hole, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two labia of the incision with a hook, and extend the white layer towards the top, without touching the skin that is enclosed: and make the incision in whatever way you can cut it, whole or partially, especially its side that is thin.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not examine carefully, the incision will not be secure, except by returning to the water.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if during your work an egg comes out of his skin: when you have finished the incision of the white layer, reduce him.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join together the two sides of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him as you do with other wounds, until he is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	That if there is a corruption of the egg from another color, then you should bind the clothes, which are suspensions, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspender, and draw out the egg: then take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if the water is gathered on both sides, then you should know that there are two branches: so dry one side according to what you have done on the other side equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if you make it so that the operation is one, then do it; afterwards wash away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce the cloth wetted with oil, or oiled cloth: and put another cloth than that which you have dipped in wine and oil over the testicles, and stretch it over the two balls of the eye: and place above it double cloths, and they will be fine: and bind them above with a ligature, which is having six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths and make them fine and red, according to this likeness: and let the ends which are pressed by the tourniquet be under the loin, or wet wool: and let them be joined with the constriction in the back of the arms: and let one end rest on some part until it reaches the back, and the other end rest on the side of the rib cage: and let the two ends rest on the lower hips, and the other end on the two groin areas, and let the whole constriction be joined with the constriction in the back of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And, when it is being surgically treated this thread with a knife in the place of the section with iron: and it is, so that you may get the knife sharp, and separate the skin of the testicles with it: and it is lit up, according to what we have told: until it is recognized by the white sutura containing water: then get the knife, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It is similar to Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with that thread, and it is lit up, until all the moisture goes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the thread with a hook, and scrape it with a sharp knife lit up, and cut off all of it for you, until you cut off everything.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And do not let the fire touch him.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you should know that this operation is more salutary, and less distant from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with the section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the opposite for you makes in the hour of the section, or in the hour of the cauterization: a hot aposteme, or a flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary that you should be concerned with what the opposite makes for you from that cure which suits him, according to what has been promised.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if the patient is shy and does not expect this operation because of his own ugliness: then administer the piercing according to what I have just said: and so it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certified by yourself that the wound is aquous: then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on an elevated chair.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in the lower part of his side with a chisel: and place the piercing according to the length of his body, and make the aperture wide enough so that all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put a cloth over the place, and tie it up, and let him go so that he may empty out the remaining water: then take care of the person, until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is an obstacle to the exit of water at the time when you pierce it: and this should not be done except for that reason, because the white cloth creates a resistance in the wound orifice and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which water is removed, whose shape has preceded: or add a little to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or around them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it is accumulated then it returns in the same way, and the sick person spends his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of the ramulus carnosus.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LIII. The head.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that there is a fear-induced head on the ramulus which leads to harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore I remove it so that it may be healed from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am remembering the operation in it, and the species of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, that many types of abscesses happen in the bodies, which are composed of testes: and it happens from many causes, indeed.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute overflow or bitterness that is discharged to the testes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And it is called apथमata according to the color of the body, and no pain is found; and it is called an apथमata gray.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is called a stone apथमata, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling of it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the enlargement of arteries, and the swelling of their vessels: as it has previously been remembered: or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is then from them by the enlargement of arteries, is known by the position of the apθημα, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But this, on the other hand, does not separate anything from it when you compress it with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is also possible that, after this form of apथमata has occurred, a section should be made and the remaining flesh: and it is, so that the skin of the testicles is separated.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend your hand to the top, and pull it out with a hook or: and free the suspenders from the water, and tie the bandage: and cut the suspenders after you have freed the bandage from all parts of them that you can.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then the consolidated hand is with those flesh-bearing bones, then it is necessary that you attract the hand, and cut it off.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if the adhesion is between some of the siphacheta, or in that which is between the suspenders: then it is necessary that you free all this adhesion, and cut it off with a round cut.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If then the birth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you cut off all this, and pull out the hand, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When your operation is completed, then fill the hand with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: and then take care of the hand with the remaining cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Of the treatment of the vine ramification.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is an apथमata somewhat hidious by the softening of the testicles, and it is difficult to move on a weak motion and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this disease there is fear, because of which there was a memory before it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it should be said, let us speak of the operation as those who came before did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say then, it is necessary that you should make the sick person sit on an elevated chair.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspender of the testicles downward.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the skin that is nearest to the scrotum: and let another hold it, and stretch it with a firm stretch.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut through with a sharp chisel, cutting transversely in the direction of the scrotum, until the skin is separated.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrub off all parts, as we have told you in extracting the arteries that are in the wrists.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in them an acme in which is a double thread, and tie it again in the first places where the grapes are: and tie it once more in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them in a straight middle section according to the length of the body, and pull out what is gathered from the corrupt wet feces.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then heal the wound with the cure of the other wounds, so that the skin that nourishes one testicle falls:
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not bad through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if all the skin falls away from any wound, then it is necessary that they should be taken out through this, because it is not covered by the skin's nutrition, because of the incision, and does not heal or scar, and does not become part of them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	As for the cure of intestinal worm:
Caput LXV.	Head LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The cure for this kind of worm is from a section that happens in the navel area over the belly in the part of the groin on one side of the abdomen.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines come out from that rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a split, or from the length of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis.	And these two types of injuries occur from many causes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Aut saltu.	Or from a fall.
Aut clamore.	Or from a cry.
Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	Or from a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign, when it is from an extended scar.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	This is what happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is a swelling equal to or deeper than the surrounding area: this is because the scar compresses the intestines.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of this is when it is from a section of scar, because it causes sudden and severe pain from its beginning: and it is a swelling that is different and appears under the skin close by: and this is because of the exit of the intestines, and their course towards the external scar.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it comes out with a wrinkled intestine: and this is called Ramus intestinalis, and wrinkles: and sometimes it happens with wind.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And when it runs into feces in the intestine and stays there: and this causes sickness and pain, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of the diseases that are associated with this, there is a danger: for which reason it should be avoided.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of treatment is, as you order the sick person to reduce his intestine by his hand into his cavity, if he obeys, he will return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then let him lie on his back between your hands: and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and dry the skin of the testicles completely over its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fasten with two fingers of the section, according to how far apart it is to open the section with them: and let the section be proportionate, so that it can come out from it without effort.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the scar and the flesh that is under the testicles, until when you touch it, a piece of hard flesh comes off: then put your index finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between the hard flesh that is under the skin, and between the second scar, and firmly join it with what is behind the scar.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then with the right hand pull out the skin of the testicles inside: and while doing this, extend the silk thread [of the ligature] high up, with the left hand: and tie off the end of it, with the silk thread, at the site of the incision: and instruct the assistant to hold it taut, so that it does not slacken when you are cutting through.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And feel with your fingers, lest there be anything there still alive, from the intestines, inside the silk thread or hard knot.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If there is something there that is still alive: then push it downwards into the gut.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take hold of the thick filament, made of ten thin strands, that runs through the silken thread: and push it in between the last part of the incision, that is, the Tunica, which lies just under the skin covering the testicles after the cut: then cut off the ends that stick out from the filament, until you have four strands.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then join some of them together with a cross-shaped figure: and tie them with the silk thread, which we have mentioned, because it is a firm knot under the skin of the testicles, until there can be no possibility that any of the veins, which supply them, can send anything to them: so that there does not come about a burst from the heat.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another knot, far away from the first one by two fingers' length.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two knots, let go of the silk thread that hangs under the skin of the testicles, to the length of a finger's width: and cut off the rest all around, leaving a circle, and take it off.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry up the lower part of the incision where the blood and pus run: as we have described earlier.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then add the wool soaked in oil to the nail: and place on it the knot that we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the silk thread that we have mentioned, the white one, is cauterized after the incision, being afraid of the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And loosen the ligament, until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its fall is delayed, then soak it with warm water: and place over it that which I have said, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the remaining cure for the wound, until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	[This is a section about ramie wool.]
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	IN this Ramie none dared to attempt the cure with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said, that it was done as we have related in the Ramie which is with the Vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, so that the wounds after cutting on them with ease go down: and then dry in the middle, and cure the wound afterwards with what opens it, until the wounds fall out: and cure the wound, according to what we have said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	[This is about the incision made in the groin.]
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When there is a rupture in the groin, as we have said, and the place comes out, and nothing of the intestines goes down to the testicles: but if it goes down, it is little, and returns at all times: but if it be prolonged with that time, there is added a fissure in the sheath, until the intestines go down into the sheath.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this thing came about from the enlargement of the sheath, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because it extends the sheath: then it softens, and the place comes out, and comes out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its cure is with a poultice, as has preceded its narration.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is cured with iron, according to this manner: and it is so, that the sick one lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry up the place of the rupture which has come out and is prominent, with an incision across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten up with a thong and, which are under the skin, until it is discovered when the sheath of flesh, which follows it, comes out.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the ray [of light], and put it on an eminence from the [sifach], and press it deeply into the eye.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then, cut two eminences from the ends of the  [ray] from the  [sifach], and connect them with a suture; then remove the end of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the   [sifach] at all, and do not touch one to another, nor anything else, as I told you in the cure of intestinal wounds.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then, consider that cure of the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you cut the   [rays], then clean it, and restore the   [wound], until it is healed.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the    [sifach] is hit against, and no eminence of the rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place; for it is nearer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Regarding the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is sometimes softened in certain men, because the flesh that is between them is softened, and its appearance is changed.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked to cure him, that he lie down on his back, and hit all of the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then aggregate two lips with a suture; and if necessary, in the first place, three sutures, or four, and a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then hit between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then consider that cure of the remaining wounds, until they are healed, and let the    [rays] fall.
¶ De Castratione.	Regarding Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that Castration is excommunicated by our law; and for that reason I shall remind you of it in this book: and its reminder is necessary only for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	The first is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it: and that he may know how to treat it when it happens to him.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	The other method is that which we often use in the castration of certain animals for our benefit, such as rams, horses, and cats and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say then that Castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by friction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by a cut and slice.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by friction the course of operation is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water until his testicles become soft and lax and hang down: then with your hand you turn them over until they have resolved and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in the castration by a cut and slice, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and with your left hand press the skin of his testicles.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie up the suspenders and dry on all of the one section until when the two balls come: then cut them after you have scraped both, and do not leave behind on them any kind of thread which is more than a needle-fine line, which is over the flesh.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by a cut and slice: for friction perhaps leaves behind some of the testicles, so the animal desires to have sex.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Of the care of hermaphrodites in two methods.
Caput LXX.	Head 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodite is from testicles in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	The male is of it because it appears to be in it that follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that it lies between the two testes, figure like a hen's, in which there are hairs: and when it runs urine from it which comes out from the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women is one kind, and is hen-like above the skin like a penis completely, sticking out to the outside: of which one is like a phallus of a male, and two like two testes.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three kinds, two from men and one from women, is this: because it is necessary that you strike the added flesh until the impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then take care of the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But in the species of men from which urine is secreted, which is in the skin of the testes, there is no operation or cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	The incision of the hernia and the prominent flesh in women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter L XXI
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The hernia might be added to the natural place until it is well and its appearance is not disfigured: and sometimes it becomes so great in some women that it reaches as far as coition.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary that you hold the hernia with your hand, or with a pin, and strike it: and not finally in the incision, especially in the deep root: so that the flow of blood does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound itself in the cure of the wound until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the middle flesh, which is born in the womb of the mother, until it fills itself: and perhaps it exits to the outside according to the similarity of tails: and for that reason some call the first illness with a tail.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary that you strike it as you struck the hernia, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	The cure of the Alatic hernia, which is a hernia in an unpierced woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter L XXII
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The Alatic is such that it is a hernia in an unpierced woman, or that there is a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural, or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental is from an illness that preceded it: and itself is formed either from meat added, or from thin skin, or from scales: and it is formed either in the deep of the mother's womb, or in her sides, or on top of her, or underneath: and it prohibits coition and conception, and birth, and perhaps also menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And his knowledge is acquired through the examination of obstetrical cases, if there is visible obesity nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then ask her with your fingers, or with a ray of light.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the obesity is from a thin layer and is nearby, then bring it close and unravel it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, so that you put it on top of two lips of wool.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands at the same time, and the woman sits with her legs extended on her back.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with strength until the thin layer is unravelled, and the obesity opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of wool, immerse it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman sit there all day so that the spot does not harden through the pressure of anything else.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the layer is thick and dense, then it should be separated with a flat leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the obesity is from flesh that has grown, then suspend it with a hook and cut it: and have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood, and the gum Arabic with its albumen.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then introduce a wide silver catheter so that the wound does not quickly harden, keep it for several days: and administer lytta from dry linseed, then treat the rest with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when the birth of a child takes place in the womb, the birth of flesh should take place: therefore it is necessary for this method to be followed: that, while there is no scrofulous disease, there should be no opposition with iron at all, since it would cause opposition from the scrofula in the womb.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Regarding the care of hemorrhoids, Athézel and BOTHOR (a red rash) in the vagina of a woman.
Caput LXXIII.	CHAPTER LXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are an opening of the anal openings, from which runs much blood frequently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	But when the ancient hemorrhoids have become thorny, then they are thorny; and I have said already in dividing their kinds and signs: and let me say here what receives cure from them, and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say then that the hemorrhoids which are in the womb-opening, and do not appear sensible to touch: then is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But which are of these hemorrhoids are in the womb-opening above the place where the sense [of touch] drops, they are those which cure.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is then necessary that you should bring the woman to a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the thorny threads upon it, or a sharp cloth, and cut it from its roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then dust them over with a powder near the flow of blood from one cut without touching them: like acacia, and dragon's blood, and saffron, and such things to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push her feet against the wall an hour long.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then let her lie in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then let her sit in a decoction of sumach, and of saltpetre, and of galangal, and such things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley-flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice therewith upon her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	But if blood should go along with it, then is good; and if not, let the back be adherent to wind and to bumps, without touching.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and dip it into the taractous juice, or into the tongue-root juice, or into the branch-root juice, that is, it shall be glad, and into Pontic wine, and let it adhere to her loins.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	But when the apothesis has become quiet, then take care of the place with ointment, until it be whole.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth verily is like to heads of garlic, and is sharp in appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then cut off what appears there, according to what I said in the thorny things equally: and take care of it, until it be whole.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	On perforation that occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Caput LXXIIII.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Oportet ergo ut consideres.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latero dextro, et administrat instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If, however, the instrument is deeper than the wound, then you should place a small pad on top of the deep matrix: to prevent the instrument from entering the entire depth of the matrix; and you should place a small spring at the upper side of the instrument that runs along the length of it; and hold the instrument, and turn the assistant's spring so that it does not open until the deep matrix is exposed.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When, however, the exit appears and is touched by hand, and it is soft and smooth: then you should separate it at its head with a small chisel on the side.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When, however, the wound is drained, then you should place a lime wood rod immersed in olive oil: or olive oil, in which there is some stiffness; and place the lime wood, and remove a piece from the deep matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place outside on the matrix, and over the wool felt washed with water, in which there are some red spots:
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then care for it after two days with a ointment that suits it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix is washed and the wound so that it swells with water and honey: then with water in which there are some red spots of lily root, or long aristo: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	That if the wound is hidden deep within the matrix, then you should refrain from treating it with iron, but rather care for it along with it as we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines of obstetrics, how embryos are treated according to a abnormal exit shape.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LVII.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know in advance the normal shape of birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	So then are the signs of this: when you see a woman compressing towards her lower abdomen, and desiring to smell the air, and letting go on her when she is above her, and hastening out in an exit, then know that this birth is according to the normal shape, and is going out before it, and second with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	So when you see these signs, then it is necessary that the abdomen be compressed so that the embryo falls faster.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when he descended on his head, he descended with him in the second, and was cleansed of those abominations by good purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But whoever is beyond this birth, is unnatural, deplorable.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus ever comes out of his feet, and the body of him goes before the head thereof, and his feet and hands one or two together, or his head and hands: or if he come forth with his belly and back: and perhaps he turneth over upon his neck, and other like figures deplorable.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary that the Midwife, be prudent, subtle in these things, and guard herself from error and deception: and I am showing all form of them, and what is understanding in it, and signifies by it, and points at it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus ever comes out of his head with its natural exit, and becomes hard to him part, and you see his virtue already weakened: then let her sit on a chair, or let women hold her: and sprinkle her with the juice of fennel, and with wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Midwife shall put her little spatula between her fingers, and find with him a second time, and dry up her nail with it, until she runs out what is in her from moisture: and press the belly of the woman, until the fetus falls.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	But if it does not fall, then it is necessary that the woman be cleaned out with the juice of fennel, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her after the cleaning, to compress: and make her sneeze with a handkerchief, and hold her nose and mouth at the same time.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	That if two hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary that you reduce them with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if he does not obey in the introduction, then put the woman on a seat, and raise her feet up: then set the seat on the ground: and the woman should hold so that she does not fall by the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	But if they do not come out the hands, and the fetus dies: then cut them, and take away the residue of the fetus: and tie his hand with a cloth, and take it out with equality: for he will come out himself.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo on her own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on his own feet, then it should be pushed up: then turn the fetus slowly: then make it equal.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of her feet, and extend it slowly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	But when they come out up to the hips, then order her to compress, and make her sneeze with a condiment: for she will come out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with me when I tell you, then reduce the fetus slowly, until you put it back in the natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For himself will come out when you make an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	That if it is prohibited with me all that I have told you: then take from the mucus of the aloe, and oil of sesame, and gumme that has been dissolved: and hit everything in the mortar with a good beating: and then put down on the woman's lower parts, and close them.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she has a hyperacidity.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	But when you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her sniff myrrh: and support him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	But when she holds the sniff for an hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and squeeze her mouth and nose: and press gently the lower part of her leg with a light compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fire will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus on her knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When you exit this form, then apply your hands gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then, the woman should lie down on her back and have her feet hanging down to the ground; and she herself should lie on a bed and spread her hands out wide.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then, he should gently press against her belly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then, he should pull out what is underneath her feet from the groin area until she is prepared at the bottom part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If it does not exit as a fetus, then take her feet and move them with a rapid motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then, he should gently press what is above the groin area gradually until the fetus ascends to the top.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then, he should insert his hands and stretch out the fetus gradually: and instruct the woman to compress, until it exits.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging downward from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Then, he should take his hands away.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If he cannot reduce her, then he should ease the woman and have her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	However, if walking is not possible, then have her lie down on a bed: and shake her legs with a rapid motion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then, administer the lubricant you prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she catches it during delivery, then have her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then, study the hands for reduction: and keep the fetus in the shape of a ring: and instruct the woman to sneeze, and tell her to compress herself, until it exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over its own head, with spread hands, and its face towards the back of its mother's body.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the Obstetrician hold the fetus by the hands: and then rotate it gradually, and stretch it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equalized, then place it on a cushion we prepared from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then, instruct her to move her arms gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	So when you have done that, then make her sit on the seat, and order her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order her to compress [the wound] and make her sneeze while she is compressed.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 Exit the fetus prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descended to the opening of the womb in this way with the second [child], then tear the second [child] with your fingernail until it is discharged from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 But if he is suspended on the surface of the fetus, and his neck, then cut him from the umbilicus  [navel]: so that he does not hold back, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus towards the inside until you have placed it  [ đúng vị trí]: and order the woman to compress herself at times: for he will come out from the opening easily.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 Exit of twins, or of a multiple fetus.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, that is rare, and seldom happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 But five is a thing outside nature, and they do not live happily together: and it holds them back, although they multiply, the second one only: and separates them with a chasm, distinguishing between them by a tied string at the navel of each.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And when they come out it is like the coming out of a natural fetus, easily: and they come out with a loud noise, as we have told you.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If any one of them is difficult to bring forth at birth, and seeks to go back into what we have said in regard to unnatural shapes, then take care of them as we have told you: and let her lie on a soft bed, and make her do what she does easily and slowly, and follow all the form with which it is prepared by nature leading to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Remember that it is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 When one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and I have proved with myself that a woman has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	What was done by the measuring of the glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This therefore must be so that it is in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For perhaps this will lead to a comparison with its like; therefore oppose it with him what is necessary
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LVII. On the head.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus with what I said in the division on medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use the operation by hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound virtue, and is not with any of the accidents from which she fears a loss: then it is necessary that the woman lie down on her bed, on her back, and have her head inclined downward, and her legs raised: and the midwife should hold her by the two sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body is not extracted with the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the womb of the mother with oil moistened with mucilage of algues and fenugreek, and seedlinseed:
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should bathe her hands with these oils and mucilages; then she should enter the woman's womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should ask where she should place her feet from the fetus, and the right places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to come down on top of its head: then place the umbilical cord on her eyes, or on her neck, or in her mouth, or in her palate, or under her beard, or in her armpits, or at places near her ribs, and under her breasts.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is on her feet: then in her rib cage, and in her ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the umbilical cord with her right hand: and let her rub it in what is between the fingers of her left hand: and she should enter with ease with her hand, and place the umbilical cord in one of those places that we have said, until it is free.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix the hook on the opposite side of the liver, or a third one if you wish: so that the contraction is equal and does not decline toward one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then extend it with an equal extension, and do not have only one extension, but move it on all sides, to relieve its exit: as is done with a tooth when it is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And you should put it between those so that the extension becomes softer.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if a part is held back from it, then the midwife should place some fingers with oil on it and insert them from that side so that they turn around with it as she holds it back.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If then a part of the baby comes out, then the hooks should be changed to another place that is higher: do this until the whole baby has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If then the hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constriction: then, a cloth should be put on top of it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until it comes out all at once, cut it or place it in the cradle, or lay it down: and you should do the same on the other hand, and on both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the baby's head is large, or if it has a constriction during its exit, or if water has gathered in its head: then, with a spittle that has thorns, find out with it the head and remove the water; or break it off with an instrument called Almisdak, whose shape comes from the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, do this if the baby is of a large nature of head: then, an algengematum should be separated: or pull it out with Misdak, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If then a head comes out and is constricted by the fork: then wait until the water that is in its chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it is not complicated, and does not yield to death: then incise the head in haste, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	That if the lower part of the leg is swollen, or there is hydrops in it: then you should drain it, until the fluid comes out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is above the feet, then its attraction is easy, and its direction towards the mouth of the mother is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is constricted at the navel, or at the chest: then you should lift it up with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand: and cut open the navel, or the chest, until what is inside comes out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if they take away the remaining member, and bring back the head: then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	But if the mouth of the mother is open: then you should insert your hand into the depth of the womb, and seek out the head, and draw it with your fingers towards the mouth of the womb: then you should insert one hook, or two hooks, and draw it towards you with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	That if the mouth of the mother is constricted, because of the hot sweat that comes to it: then it should not work on the fetus, but then you should administer an infusion of liquids, and thick substances: and apply poultices: and sit in water that softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	That if the fetus is above its side, then it is possible to make it even: then administer what we have said for a single fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	That if that is not possible, then cut it in haste, and remove it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you should not leave anything inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have finished your operation, then administer what we have said about the hot sweats that come to the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	That if blood comes out: then go down into the Strictive waters, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have already seen a woman, in whose womb the fetus was dead: and then impregnated on top of it another wicker, afterwards the fetus died another also.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then he happened to her after a long time a scar in the navel, and it swelled up until it was opened and began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	So he called me to cure her, and I treated her for a long time: but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Then I put over it some kind of strong plaster: and he came out of place by the mouth.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed, and he came out with another mouth.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	So I marveled then, when there is no mouth in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	So I thought, because there were bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I asked about the wound, and I took out many bones, to the woman who was in better condition: and now it did not last long at all, and discharged a little pus from place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I do not hold this strange, unless that in it is the science, and help to it, which the artisan-doctor administers with his hand in the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms Of the Instruments necessary In extracting the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Strappado, which are equal to two scrolls in two extremities of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this Vertiginous should be made so as to be subtler in the Strappado: and for it to be made either from ebony or from wood of bush.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the width of each wood be as two fingers: and the edge of either of them be as one finger, and the length of each of them be a palm and a half less: and there shall be in the middle of the two woods two pieces of the same kind of wood, which are both firm, their length being a palm and a half more and a little less: and the width of either of them be as two fingers or a little less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the jaw, so that it opens up with them when you turn your head to the left and right.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Form of vertigo which opens the jaw.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Other form, similar to it but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from wood of ebony, or from resin, according to the similarity of the hooks.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition from them is almost a nut: and the width of either is, two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	So when you are going to open the jaw with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, hanging her feet from the side: and open what is between her shoulders.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two additions joined together into the jaw: and you hold the end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with the hooks, equally according to the quantity which you wish to make by opening the jaw of the mother: until the obstetrician does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Form of vertigo other than that which the ancients said, Form driving the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	Form of alμισdax, which grinds the large head: and resembles the hook, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is made oblong, like this hook form, as you see, which has teeth like a saw, so that it cuts and grinds.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	Form of almisdax, which grinds the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form of vincum having one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form of vincum having two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Form of the hook which has saw teeth, with which the head of the fetus is ground.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	Form of spatumilis having two ends to cut the head off.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form of the two spatulamilia also broad.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used, and the more they multiply in kind, and are prepared by the artisan, the faster they carry out their work, and the higher among men because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not then despise these instruments, for they are prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is not excusable that necessity of them.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	[On the extraction of the second part].
Caput LXXVIII.	Head CXLIV.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second child is held back at the time of delivery, then you should prevent the weak one from being taken away, so that he may retain his desire.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then put it in place with a press; and firmly hold your hand upon its nose, and the nostrils of it.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If then he goes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a wand, and pierce in the lid an aperture: and put into it herbs opening the mouth of the mother, such as calamus, rue, anise, camomile, chamomile, cassia-wood, and centaury; take all these herbs, or some of them, and boil them in water, and put them on the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a twig of oak into the aperture of the jar, and another at the other end in the mother's mouth; and let it remain until the vapor comes to the congealing of the mother's milk.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then put it in place for sneezing, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second child will then come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If it remains after this cure, and does not come out: then order the midwife to dip her hand in oil of sesame, or mullein.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should put it into the whelk, and ask where the second child is.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When then finds it, then let her take it, and extend it slowly.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If it is attached to the milk deep down, then put your hand in, according to what we have said, until you find the second child, and gradually take it out, so that the mother' s milk does not come off with a sudden pull: but it should be turned by degrees to the right and left: then add attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For then it obeys, and is withdrawn, and is separated from the adhesions.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the umbilical cord is tied, as we have already related: care for it with sterilizations and from the medicated ooze with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not go out with all that we have related, then be careful not to tire yourself out in the extraction process.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is true that when it comes out of the womb, there should be a few drops of blood on the woman's legs.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then cleanse her with the four-fold ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will corrode her after a few days, and dissolve away, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it putsrefies, let an evil smell go out from her to the stomach and head, and hurts that one with illness.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, let appropriate suffumigations be administered to that one.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some, however, have long since experienced the suffumigations of nasturti and dried fennel.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	Form a tool for suffumigation to the woman during the second and menstrual days.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a kind of wormwood or fennel, and let it be placed at the end of a fire; and let the suffumigation be put on plums: hold it in place until that suffumigation is consumed: and then take another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	¶ Of the cure for the wound do not pierce.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their umbilical cords are not pierced, which have now been softened by the subtle siffar.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, let the midwife pierce it with her finger: and if she does not, then pierce it with a sharp awl: and be careful of the rope, so that it does not touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put on top of it the wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you are aware that he has been drugged, then put a plumb-line in the hole for several days, and remove it when the boy wants to urinate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And also it happened that An was affected by a wound due to either consolidation or abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that this consolidation be removed, and then it be cured with the one that we have said about cure and plucking.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 § On the Cure of Fistulas That Occur in the Lower Part.
Caput LXXX.	Head 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a nodulation and grossness that occurs close to the anus or in the space of one of the parts; and there is one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	And when this nodulation has been broken open, it will open and run out from it a watery white discharge, or pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are known because of what comes out from defecation and windiness, when a sick person has it; and perhaps it comes out from them dry.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas when they penetrate into the space up to the skin, and up to the edge of the testicles.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are fistulas that penetrate up to the joint of the hip, and up to a nodule at the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this one, when it is recognized that a penetrating fistula goes up to an organ, and not from a non-penetrating one, is, as you put your finger on the anus: and try to put in it a little thin wire of metal: when there is no bending.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	That if there is a bend in it, then put in it a little wire of lead or a needle from the hair of a horse, until you feel the attempt, or a needle in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	That if you do not feel it itself, and does not come out from any opening of defecation, and no windiness, and no skin as I said: then you will know that it is not penetrating: so go on to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula is penetrating up to the testicles, or up to the edge of the urinary meatus: then its meaning is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place consolidates with medicine.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it really does penetrate as far as the joint of the hip, or as far as the hip itself: then its sign is that it should reach this far, if there is no tortuosity as far as the mouth: and there is a sensation of pain in the surrounding part, and that it always comes out pus from it: and that it does not heal with ointment, nor hardens with the application of unguent.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these fistulas, if they all penetrate, there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is toil and old age, from foolish doctors, for whom a form is created.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating, and not old, there is hoped for a cure with a severance: for I tell you, and I have already proved it: and it is, let the sick man lie between your hands on his back: and rub down his legs all the way up to his hips, and his hips should be bent towards his abdomen.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then, after introducing a plunger, or air, if there is a tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the tentacle reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if the sick person feels it around a certain part, then it is necessary to introduce your index finger into that part.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	But if you feel the tentacle already penetrated into himself detected, besides that you feel it between your finger and the skin, or meat: then therefore you know certainly, that it is penetrating: do not work in it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	But they said that he is cured in some people with meat, and from the medication by which he hopes to relieve, is, that one should light a fire of fine caustic substances according to the width of the fistula, as has been said before, and introduce that fire into the fistula, until it reaches around a part.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that again twice, or three times, until you know that all those added meat, filtered through, which are similar to a feather of an owl, have been burned away.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then that wound with a cold-water wash in butter, until the flesh comes out, which is dry: then that wound with an ointment that generates flesh and solidifies it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it does not heal with any other cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out with a straw and does not reach the tip of your finger, which is in the anus, and is between it and the straw a thick flesh-like substance, or snot: and you will see a fistula on its surface; then dry off the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and let the straw run dry wherever it reaches the end of the extremities, and let the straw come out and fall.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filthy meats, which resemble the feather of a bird in the ear, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood annoys you, and dissolves between you and between your operation as it separates those meats: then it is better that it happens so, and faster to heal with a burn, to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the burn with fire جمع the good habits, to the burning of that flesh, and to the stopping of blood, and drying up of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then that wound with a cold-water wash in butter, or crushed clays, until the place lets out puss, and the dry flesh comes out in puss.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then that wound with an ointment that solidifies and generates hard flesh: and there are medicines in which are sterilizations and drying up.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are washed, then it is healed at once: and do not put off the cure.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has reached deep into the anus, and it is elongated by the overflow of the body's fluid: then put your finger into it, and feel with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And if you feel the straw between you and it, and there is a thick substance of snot or flesh near the penetration: then there is no cure in that, except after another visit of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is administered in him of the two ways: either as cauterizes herself, as we said: or separates her, until the consequences of her converge, so that it is possible for you to intrude liciniae, and cure from next.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the section, so that you do not hit a serpentine containing member, and happens on an exit of infirmity without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for that with him that we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps is he will be healed: or you lengthen the same limb, and clean it up until close to a member, as we have said, or with a probe, or with another acute extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filthy meats which are in the section, until where you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then endeavor to restoration of the wound of all the section, and hole if it consolidates: and remains a open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and will be lighter on infirmity.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes follows this way: and it is when you introduce a probe in the fistula: and it is in the side of the anus near to the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take the probe of the acute extremity which is as a needle of awl, that is, preparational core, following this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into her the thread of five threads, and around her.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce a probe with a thread in the fistula, until the consequences of its converge.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it penetrates into the margin of the anus near, then extract the thread from that hole: so that you introduce your finger in a member, and extract the extremity of the thread, and unite both extremities together: and tighten each of them, and leave it for one day or two days: and however much the thread incises into the meat, tighten it well, until those meats which are between the two extremities of the thread strike down: then care for the wound, until it consolidates, and is healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the fistula's opening is not penetrating: then let the patient be made to penetrate wherever you prepare him, unless it be in a deep place.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you are not to make the surgery because of the snake, so that you may not hurt yourself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do it as we have said, until he is well.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The form of the spike that the fistula is found, whose depth is sharp and very sharp, and one side is not acute, so that it does not hurt the one who is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Regarding the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXVIII.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are within the anus, like carbon lumps, or prunes: or almost like grain.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And some of them are small and great: and blood flows from them always, and one is joined to the other.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But the external hemorrhoids are, for the most part, very few in number, and of moisture, from which flows yellow water, or a little blood with constant flow: and they are, according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure that is within the anus, as you would have it done to the sick, so that he may soften: and be expressed, until the anus comes out, and appears to you as a little hole.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore hang them with a hook: or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them near their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they do not hold themselves with hooks, because of their moisture and their own softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or a twig of oak, and draw them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle on them some hot powders after the incision, so that they stand in place of a causticum.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	He cauterizes them according to what has been said in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with the remaining cure until they are cured.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	That if he does not obey the exit of the stool, then let him use the stool for small enemas so that it comes out with it what is in the ano, and obeys the exit quickly when it comes out with it that which is in the ano,
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If, however, they are external from the ano, then their affair is lighter, easier: and it is as if you take them with your finger, or you take them with a hook and throw them down.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with that which we have said, until they are cured.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And who hates incisions with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their sutures in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a wet thread, and insert it into the cavity.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then remove the foreign bodies from above, and let him penetrate with the point of the needle into the root on one side: and wrap the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, and let them run horizontally: and tighten the foreign body with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie a knot in the thread, and extract the cavity.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Then do the same with all the foreign bodies, and let go of one: and do not put your own finger on it, so that it runs out of the excess blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over a cloth soaked with rose oil, or with aloes, and place the body on top of it: and order the sick person to lie down.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then remove the body, until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	So when they fall out, take care of them with ointment, and with the remaining cure, until they are cured.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often a person comes from the drying out of feces, and from the nature's contraction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they are slightly dried up, and do not respond to medicine: then you should scrape them with the points of the scraper, or with your own finger, until they become moist, and remove from them the upper crust that prevents them from being consolidated.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them until they are healed as is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not heal: then treat them again with a more intense effort than before, until they bleed a lot, and then take care of them, until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	The cure for the sick with fever, and not the sick without fever: and for poison, and for a stings of insects.
Caput LXXXII.	Head 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that Almirmar is nothing other than a rotund knot according to the color of the body, similar to a clawhead: it occurs throughout the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and it causes pain when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, so that what is in the circle of the claw is removed, and held with forceps, or with a hook, and cut at the root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of that one: and if you want to cauterize it according to what preceded in his chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	But from poison there is one eminent little thing, rough, filtered, rotundous on top of the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And it often happens in the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its cure is, so that you spread out the poison, and hit it itself: or you tie it with silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you want to, cauterize it according to what has been said above with fire, or with acute medicine: and the poison with an inverse spin is eradicated by a tool that I call.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	But the ant is also an eminent little thing, filtrated, coarse, on top of the surface of the body, crawling into the depth strongly: and when it finds it cold, one feels in it a similar stinging like an ant's bite, and it occurs throughout the whole body: and most of it is made in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its cure is, so that you take a tube from the feather of a goose, or from a peacock's feather strongly: and put that tube over the ant, until it contains the circle of the tube from all parts of her.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then with the cane turn your hand, until you separate what is around the formica; and place it in a deep flesh, and pluck out the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, make it with an air cane or iron, according to this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Sit above the cane to the limit by pulling back the slough of the wound, so that the pressure on the finger and its turning may be eased.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the formica according to what has been said in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Deformities Of Instruments That Are Used To Cleisters In Illnesses Of The Anus And Washing Out Of The Wound And Colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When the clister is made of silver, or of gold-plate, or of common bronze, or of hammered bronze.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when they are made of these instruments, small and large, according to those in which they are used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	So that what is administered in the cure of small boys shall be small, and those of their age shall have weak or sore anus, so shall also be their clisters.
Clistere magnum.	The clister
Cistere paruum.	The clister
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cane of its head, that is to say, the ligature of the uter, shall be wide according to this form: and let it have a distinction so as to be tied like you see, and its lower extremities which enter into the anus, are closed, that is to say, not open, soft, very delicate, drawing toward slowness: and on one side of its head there shall be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the size of the holes shall be according to the thickness of the rays, and the thickness of the string, and let there be in which to put the medicine from a goat's milk: or from a paper roll, which is according to the form of a small egg: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let there be many holes pierced like a turn-around, and let the space which is between every hole be the size of a finger's width.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those fossae a strong filament from raw thread, which consists of ten fils, or around them, and join it with the other one like aspirotes.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When however such a bag is placed therein, a clister in the head between the two distinctions should be strongly pulled together with a constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then the clister should be joined with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the uterus as depicted here, and the fossae.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the threading with it is this: fill the uterus or apply a medicine that has been heated according to the tolerance of the nurse: and be careful not to be too hot, or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie on his back and raise his legs towards the ceiling: then place the thread underneath, that is, skin over which the person will lie, or a cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then the end of the clister should be immersed in oil, or chalk, or mucus of fenugreek, or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into a certain place with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then take the instrument with both hands at once and squeeze it vigorously until all that is in the clister has been expelled into the uterus.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clister and have the patient raise his legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine is to induce discharge, then hold it as long as you can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more effective.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you thread it into the uterus during a female menstrual period, and the discharge is sudden: then repeat the threading, until the woman is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	That if there are hemorrhoids or itching in the anus, then a mild hot seat should be used, gently and without constriction, as it is threaded.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a thin clister on which there is a tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	Of the treatment of wounds to the head without fracture of the bones.
Caput LXXXIIII.	caput liii.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I said ten times in the division of the cure of the wound that suited the book, and I say here the cure of them with the hand, and with medicines according to the second supplement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say then, that wounds differ according to that which is made a wound, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The wounds which are often made are as many as the blows of a stone: or the cut of a sword, or of an axe, or the strike of a spear, or of a stick, or of an arrow; and like these there are many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But the wounds which are made according to the places of the body are, as a wound that falls on the head, or on the neck, or on the breast, or on the belly, or on the side; and such like members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling the cure of some wounds, that I may set forth the reasoning and rule for the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: because the memory of the composer will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say then.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	I say then. When there comes to be a simple wound in the head, and there is no fracture of the bones: consider then, if it is from a blow of a stone, or similar, and already has broken the skin only: and it is a great wound, and fear for the consequences of fever: then approach and perform phlebotomy on the head immediately: and do not tarry with it: and draw out his blood according to its strength: if there is no obstacle to phlebotomy, especially if that blood which issues from the wound be little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let phlebotomy take place from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person abstain from wine, and from coarse food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if restraint from something prevents him, then he should abstain from little food, and not approach meat, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the ulna if it happens that he has an apostema warm, a cotum infusion in oil rose water only, or with wine in which is styptics.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are free from the hot apostema, then put on the ulna, if it is new with its own blood, and has not changed the air, the powder that I will describe after a little: and if it has already changed the air, then put on the skin a certain ointment, until healing.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the ulna is large, or is from an incision of a sword, and similar: and the lips do not collect with powder, then collect them with a stitch, according to what I will describe in the wounds of the legs about their stitches.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the ulna has already been removed from the bone, and hangs down, and does not hang by anything, except for a small suspension: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the ulna with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh at the place of the skin, and order to the sick person that he eat food in which there is thickness, such as are heads, and cooked wheat, until it is as a pulse: and to him similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	That if the ulna is in the skin putrefaction, and does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the whole putrefied part, and throw it away: then care for that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there is an artery in these wounds, or new blood flows from it: and does not cut off by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	But if you do not cut the ulna, then dry it with Spatemili, or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if necessity compels you when you do not give what I have said, then burn it, until blood comes out.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small and simple, then the matter of them is easy, light: so that powder over them this powder: because they harden before they change them with air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The Mode of the Powder for the Incision.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Take one part of the oil of olive, two parts of the blood of a dragon, and three parts of the ashes of a non-extinct calcis: knead them all together thoroughly, and pass them through a sifter; then fill them with a bone, and tighten it with a good constriction, until it adheres well to itself and is congealed with blood.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For this medicine will not be eradicated from it until it is cured.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it makes this calx alone, for you do not have olive oil present at the moment, and also makes the same operation in many large wounds, when it comes to be placed on it and tightened, and are wounds recently with their own blood, which has not altered air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	That if it has already been altered by the air in any way, especially when it is in the summer season, then it is not in the position of this powder: therefore take care to put on it a kind of digestive ointment: or put on it a powder made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until it expels pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care to this other cure, until they are cured.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens that with a broken fracture in the bone and it is small, then remove it with Gesti: and I have already said the cure for fractures of the head in that which will happen.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	For the wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXVI. On the wound of the neck.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a bone has broken in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if a cut has already occurred in the nerve of the neck, or in an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it unless it is treated with that which causes a sharp stinging, like Ziniar, and the numbing, and similar things:
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For the nerves are hurtful and they harm them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is above the limbs: and let this be treated by doctors with lene, like lead mixed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and turpentine, also when it is washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, according to this mode, and moist unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then apply a stitch: or cover it with powder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for himself, until he is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If on the other hand the wound is deep, or has occurred a pocket of pus in the lower part of it, then pierce it in a depressed place in that.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If the artery has already been cut and its flow of blood is followed: then separate it, or dry it up, and tie it: or causticate it, if necessity compels to do so.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If on the other hand the bone has already been hit by a gout, or all of it, and it is well as it were: then join the skin with a stitch over the cannum (gout), and do not touch the gout, but bring it back to its own shape, and reduce it.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten it with a loose stitch, and let go of it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for himself with unguents, until he is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then inquire about it: if there are any fragments of bone in it, remove them all, or as many as you can: and as for that which is not prepared, leave it, until the wound putrefies, and its exit separates and becomes free.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then powderize the top of it with the powder that you have spread over.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If the wound is in the nerve and has become a fistula: then care for it with that which belongs to it, as it is described in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	The ulnar nerve in spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	The ulnar nerve in spatulas.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If the wound is from a lance or a knife: and if you see the depth of it, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If, therefore, from the ulna comes a bleeding, and when he breathes he becomes weak, then know that the ulna is deadly.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	That if it is not deep, and it is only a little with blood: then do not put powder on it at first hour, nor bind it so that the blood does not go into its depth, and go back to the heart, and makes it weak: but put on it an attractive ointment, and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If, however, the ointment is not present with you, then put in the wound a clean cotton cloth, that it may suck out what goes out of it from the humors: and let the sick man sleep on the ulna, that what is gathered in it may run out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If, however, three or more days have passed since the wound, and there has happened no spasm to the sick man, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor a contraction in the breath, and you see its other dispositions good: then know that the ulna is saved.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Take care of it, and with gentleness, and with the whole cure, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If, however, its healing is completed, and it has now opened always, then know that it has now become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Take care of it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the ulna is from an incision of a sword or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the back, or of the back: then take care of that with what went before from the stitch, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and has come out of it with a crack: then ask about the ulna, and hurry to remove those cracks, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separated, then let them go until the marrow rotten, for extraction of them allays the pain.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But of the remnants of the wound and accidents in the remaining member in the cure, is the judgment which we have spoken of.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	De wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestine, and the emergence thereof.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which happens to the belly, is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore when and how the intestine emerges, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why does this intrusion happen, and their suture is more painful and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small disruption also happens to be difficult from a different mode.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Follows that, as for the reduction of them is more difficult, if you should not be careful about the intrusion into its place immediately: because it swells up, opens, and thickens: why does the entry become difficult?
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore this type of disruption is better than the small one: because when the reduction of the intestine does not become difficult, like it does in these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the belly is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures meet in the suture of the belly, and the suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly communicate with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper when it is a suture of the belly: and I will tell you at each time with an exposition and explanation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I therefore say, that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine emerges from it, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is because of one or both of these two species.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said: Or because there is swelling in the intestine from cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore that is so, then you must heat the wound, so that it is submerged in a sponge, or a wet cloth in warm water by itself.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	I will decocciate [decocculate] it in water, and fennel, and spice, and imbibe [imbibe] it with the intra-intestinal embrocation until the swelling subsides.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When the wine in which there is stenosis: and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see that the swelling has already resolved, then dampen the intestines with water in which the decoccultation is made, or worse.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by it the entrance of it is alleviated when it is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however the departure of it is excused after this treatment, then find in disruption a little, with an instrument wherewith they are held together.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than to operate: and there is no coercion in operating after necessity and want of instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be which is twisted, acute, and the other part not acute, and the extreme soft not with the softness of Spatulimis, but rather harder a little: and this is that which resembles caiada, as you see it.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the tendon is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it should be, that it is reduced according to its own natural form in its own place, if possible above it: for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When however the disruption is wide in the lower part of the womb: then you should, that you make lay sick on his back, and put his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the womb, then you should, that you raise its head and its breast higher than its lower part.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And likewise if the disruption is in one of two parts of the womb, then you should, that portion which has the tendon be higher by the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it should be, that you admit it into large wounds, and into middle-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In wounds however small, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it so that a faithful servant sits between your hands, who holds the whole laceration in his hand: and add to them lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then find out from him who follows the seam something after something: and this is a way of common sewing one seam.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is so, that you take up now, or number now according to the quantity of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the end of laceration quantity of finger ring, that is, measure: and fix now one more than you put into it thread in two ends of skin, with two ends of syphac which is under skin from within, until you make it penetrate from other part, and thou already have added two ends of skin, and two ends of syphac: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with thread double in circumference accus some from both sides at the same time, until there are added two lips of wound to the aggregation decenting.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go also the thickness of finger and fix in them now another: then make it straight with thread, as you did with the first.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	So do not cease to do that thing with him when he holds him from the acubukus, until you finish the constriction of wound of all.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let there be accus medio between the thickness and subtility: for acus subtile very quickly incide flesh: and grossae are difficult entry into skin: therefore let there be accus medio in subtility, and in thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary, that acus be fixed in two ends of skin proxime बहुत: lest flesh very quickly incide, and open wound before its consolidation, and do not also elongate with the sew, lest wound be prevented from its consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off end of accus so that they do not hurt the sick near its sleep: and put them feathers from cloth from all part, which hold the ends of accus: and let go them, until you know that wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of stitch with acutely pointed needles is indeed more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since one, or two, or about them will suffice.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second kind of stitch is common, as you gather the four ends: the two ends of the skin and the two ends of the suture in one thread, with an aiguille whose point is refined in subtility and thick in bulk.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you pierce with the needle these four ends, bring them together from the part where you began, so that the thread is relaxed from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitch is made, as it were, like a stitch in a piece of cloth which is gathered up, and place between each stitch the quantity of thickness of a small finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of stitch is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I sewed up a wound on a man's abdomen, which had been cut with a knife, and the cut was about an inch deep: and two inches from the mid-gut emerged two inches of small intestine, and in the middle of the groin there was a break.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So I reduced that after he had been standing for twenty hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound then was consolidated in the space which had been about fifteen days: and I cared for him, and he recovered: and after that he lived for many years, enjoying his usual health.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle, for I healed him with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Since I was in a place where the ointment could not be obtained, and there were no doctors.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	So I placed on the wound a fresh cloth twice a day, and kept up the washing with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	Two kinds of stitch are described by the author according to the context of his narrative.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, as you begin with the sharp stitch: and insert the needle from the outside into the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle has penetrated into the skin, and runs along in accordance with the length and breadth of the whole body: let go of the end of the thread which you inserted from outside into the inside, and let it run through the other end from the interior part to the exterior at the opposite end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	And when you have made it penetrate thus, then make it penetrate in this way, in that same end, the mirach from the exterior part to the interior: and dismiss the end sifac, which is in this side, and make it penetrate now in the other end from the interior part to the exterior: and make it penetrate with your penetration, as you do when you make it penetrate in the sifac end of the mirach, which is in his part, until it penetrates all of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also begin from this same side, and also yourself with the end, which is from sifac in the other side, and now remove it from the skin where it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it into that skin, and also the end sifac, which is in the other side, with this end mirach: and remove it out of that skin which is from his part, and make that one thing, and another: and make that other thing after that one, until they are both outside altogether according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the summit of this suture is as their suture which sews the skin together: so that their end sifac one from part of the skin: and that you dismiss it the other one from the other part, until you finish.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Second species of suture, which was said by Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech has been told, as if their are some who make them come together in the same way that they are by nature: and apply the end sifac to the other end of it, and the end mirach to the other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this one is made as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you make it now in the end of the mirach which is near to you from the exterior part, and make it penetrate into the interior in this one alone: and dismiss the two ends of sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then reverse now, and make it penetrate from the exterior part to the interior in the two ends of sifac, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then reverse the other two also, and make them penetrate from the interior to the exterior in the two ends of the mirach, which are on the opposite side: and make it so that both penetrations can be seen outside.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common facile suture, and it is a suture whose predecessor was remembrance.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the speech of Galen also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And said someone.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the hand with two thorns.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, so that you put one thread through both: and start with the insertion of the thorn, from the fact that it is with you, and let it penetrate until the side of the other, according to the sutures of their coriums which are equal.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the hand: then the suture of it is more difficult than the remaining places of the hand.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the cure of the wound, is the judgment of the other wound.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you achieve a wound with its blood, before it changes itself: and reduce the intestines, and their own things, and fit themselves: then put it on the powder of the carnation.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	That is, if the air has already changed the wound: then put on the wound a certain ointment, which are present with you, until they make a pus: and let the threads fall, and harden the sifac, and heal.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then the cure of that is like the cure of the other wound, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If they are not present with you the medications, then put on the wound immediately, from the fact that it begins to emit pus, and changes the old one: and change the wound twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medication in many dispositions, when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If you are the case, that a wound communicates with the main members in injury, then it is necessary that you immerse the wool in oil of temperate warmth, or in rose oil: and put it on the wound in the circumference of the places which are between the hips, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	That is, if it feels pain, or punctures, or corruption in its intestines (for this often happens): then stir up the wound with wine of strychnum, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestines, and a penetrating matter has appeared until its completion.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you shall know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal; and that what is from within it is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	And the intestine which is called the jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that has occurred therein at all; and this is because of its multitude, which is from within it, and its size, and its subtlety in the body, and its nearness in the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the wound is small, and you manage it carefully: reduce it according to your reduction, so that you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if there is space left, and it has already been infected with pus or blackened: then you should tighten it with a thread above the place that has become corrupted from it, so that blood does not flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the intestine are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and put two ends of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside the intestine: so that it will alleviate its attraction towards you, and its extraction at the site of the wound on the side of the ring, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	This is a reminder of a wound that has occurred in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When the rupture has occurred in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible for some people to be restored; because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and there was a wound on the right side of his stomach, and it was an old wound; and a fistula developed from it, and effluents came out of it, and there were windstorms.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I applied the treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; and I did not pay close attention to it, until it had healed, and the place had become consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place now consolidated, I feared for the illness that might occur in his belly: and it did not happen to him from that accident any bad occurrence.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	He remained in better health, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering a bath, and exercising his exercises.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters said that because when there is a stab in the intestine and it is slight: then it should be tied according to this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And is, so that you take flies of big heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then collect two lips of the wound, and place one fly out of these which have an open mouth over two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	And so, when it has a head on it, and ties its mouth, cut off its head, because it clings, and does not loosen itself.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another fly next to the first one, and do not stop doing this with the fly after a second quantity of the wound's size.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the wound, and tie it up.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	That head remaining attached to the intestine, until it is fed with the intestine, and heals up, and does not cause any harm to the inside completely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible that the intestine be tied with a thin thread also: which is removed from the animal's intestine, joined to it after it has entered into the bag.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And is, so that you take the end of this thread out of the intestine, and cut off a lot of it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the end of this thread with a thin cloth wrapped around it.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert this thread into the bag, and tie the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the wound in a rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of sewing with flies and intestine is no better than a second trust or hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, a wound that is large and broad, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then is no device but cutting away, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Of the care of Zuchem, and of Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head LXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know, that every wound, or ulcer when it grows old and dries up, and turns into a sore, and does not heal over, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then it is called generally a fistula wherever it may be in any member: and we call this same Zuchem.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And the fistula is indeed a node of inflammation that has become hard and white: when there is no pain, but the sound is shrill; and because of this, some call it what is called in Arabic 'risâ', that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps it splits into moisture in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And when this moisture is much, and it is little; and it is thick, and it is fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already pre-empted in the division; then when I said wounds, that every wound which does not heal, and does not arise in it flesh, is not that except for one of causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is that, or because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its wickedness; or because it is between itself, and on its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the birth of meat; or because it has much dirt and filth; or because the wound is putrid, and the matter that is cast out from it is of bad quality; or because the remedy is inappropriate in its cure; or because the corruption falling into the region is a kind of pestilence, or through its property in the region, as happened in Caesar Augustus: in which it is difficult to digest diseases, and its recovery from pustules by nature is delayed; or because there is only one opening, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all the stations and causes of these wounds, and their cures with doctors in a division; and it is necessary here that I should tell you about the cure of the fistula and the zakken, which is done by means of a surgical operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You therefore know, that the fistula happens in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them are the fistulas which reach into large veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestines, or urinary bladder, or some of the ribs on the back, or some of the joints of the skeletal structure: such as the hands and feet: and from them are those which go up to the proximity of the main member, and others.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	What then from these Fistulas is, according to this mode, of difficult cure, and does not receive benefit, and the occupation with it is labour and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If then from the Fistulas there is any whose depth does not reach to these places which I have said: and thou shalt hope, and trust in the cure thereof, and enquire about it with it, then take it holding on of brass or iron, if the Fistula tendeth in rectitude, and inquire after it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if in the Fistula there is any tortuosity, then investigate it with a fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead with its gentleness softens the body, and deals with tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	That if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate over it with a lead.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	So that you may know about the Fistula from its one opening out of its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For humidity which clisterizes itself, directs towards other openings, and runs from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire, according to which manner it is possible for you to know: that you may know whether there is an opening there, or a nerve, and the Fistula is concaved far off, or near: or is a Fistula one whose openings are many, and stands over all of it with great strength of your own: by your questioning which you question the sick, and by finding of pain at compression with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causes of accidents apart.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When then you are standing on all of that station with true stability, then advance to cure according to confidence: and is, as you consider then, if there is a Fistula near appearing, or in a healthy place far off from a joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places which I have said to you: then dry up the Fistula according to what has been stated before from my narration, and remove whatever is in it from filtration, and corrupt flesh which comes forth from its opening out of the flesh, or thistle, and similar things: and cure that, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is distant and deep, and straight: then you should close it as much as you can.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then clean it out completely of all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply the poultice of fresh meat in acute medicines: and insert it as far as you can into the fistula that you apprehended with the iron: do this often, until the acute medicine has completely eaten away all that is left in the fistula's closure from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with a unguent that generates healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal with that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	But if the cause of the fistula is an opening, and this can be confirmed by you: then examine it, and cut it out according to what I have told you: if it does not forbid you to take some flesh, or a nerve, or a main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	But if it is detected by you that there is some corruption and blackening in it: then shave it off, until all the corruption has been removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the flesh with what heals the flesh, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	That if it does not heal, and it is discharging pus as it did before: then you should know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore examine it a second time, and carefully feel it, and clean it with your last strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	But if it heals, that is good: and if not, then you should know that that corruption is in a distant part of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	So you do not have the skill to treat it, so you must let nature deal with it.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	That if the corruption is in a small opening, and it is possible for you, attract it with subtle hooks that suit it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then carefully feel for all of them, and do not let go of any of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, you feel a contradiction from the moisture, and there is no fear or mistake in the incision, then cut those moistures and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones at your own time, then place over the humerus what should decay itself: and let it alone until it decays what is in the surroundings of their bones from flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the humerus so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the incision which you followed in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Below place over the bone, if you wish, a soaked three times with oil: or a soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some kind of ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures putrefy, and the bones separate from them, the removal of them is relieved, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If, however, there is one large bone, such as the femur, or the pelvis, and similar to them, and that which has腐敗した from it is a large part: then shave that bone with the last razor, until that腐敗した and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the humerus.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If, however, what is in that bone腐敗した is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone, and cut the flesh all the way to the place where the corruption reaches: then take care of that bone, until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you the story of the man who happened to his femur: that you may place it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	He was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom there came pain in his femur, from a cause which moved within the body, that is, from within, until it reached the leg, and there was formed an ulcer great enough: and there was not for him an extrinsic cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So he stayed with that error of the doctors, until it opened up, and a lot of matter came out with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after that his cure is delayed until his hand is healed, and many openings are made in it; which all emit pus and the moisture of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So he was treated by a number of physicians for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of his hand, until I was called; and then I saw his hand, and the matter that came out of those openings ran in great stream: also all the flesh of his body was already rotten, and his color was citrine.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So I entered one of the openings with a probe, and the probe came to the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings, and I found that they led into each other from all parts of the hand.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Then I pushed, and followed one of those openings until I came to the bone: and I found it corroded, decayed, rotten, and pierced, all the way down to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	So I cut off what had been detected by me, and prepared it from corrupt bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I left, for there was nothing in the bone but that corruption, which I cut away and I closed it up.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And so I had made an end of it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed a patch of healing flesh on the wound with long-consolidated medicine.
Et non est consolidatum.	And there was no consolidation.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed, and found a second bone beneath the detection; and I found that the corruption continued to the bone: so I closed it up as well, for there was also corruption from that part.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to heal it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not healed.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Then I probed again, and did not cease to cut into the bone little by little, and to try to heal it; but it was not healed until I cut out a piece of bone about the size of a palm, and took it away with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I healed it with medicine, and it consolidated quickly, and was made sound; and this repetition of the operation, and sectioning of the bone, was not necessary unless for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of endurance, and my fear for him from death: for he suffered in all hours from a bad flow of fluid.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If, however, the jaw is broken in a part of the body where it has already emerged: then it is necessary to tighten it according to this manner: and thus: so that you take the ligament, and tighten it in the extreme end of the prominent bone: and order someone who will stretch it upwards: and put another ligament made of coarse woolen thread on the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie the ligament over the meat which is on the bone: and stretch the extreme end of it so that you pull the meat downward: and you cover the meat over the place that you wish to tighten, so that it does not hurt when you cut the meat.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place the ligament, or a board under the bone downwardly askew: for when you do this, it does not hurt to tear the meat apart.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it should be so that there is a tightening on the corrupted place to some extent, so that there is not the appearance of the bone's corruption: and does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and drives at the tightening of his own power.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, then a part of it continues with another part: and corruption is in its middle or in one of its parts: then cover all meat with its part.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the ligament downwardly.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then tighten that which is on the first part where there is corruption until there is tightening from the second part: and let it be tightened according to the length from the corruption to some extent, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, then cut that which is corrupted at the joint, and tighten the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no strength in that except for a scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the palm of the foot, then the matter is difficult to treat.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But you should also ask how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And then scrape it off, and clean it up as best you can, and with whatever skill you have: when it does not give you a contrary vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many knives and saws to cut these bones, according to the position of the bones, and the preparation of them, and their grossness and subtlety, and their size and smoothness and roughness of them, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore you should prepare for each type of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know, these operations demand from you to pay attention to the instrument you are holding when you are studying a long time.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of these ways of this art is a witness to your own health: for then you will find out through yourself what suits each illness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you put as examples for those on which you cut, and as proof for what you have experienced on others.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of a third saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of a fourth saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw drawn, but not well made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its bow be made higher, and its keenness from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and its base be made askew.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of a razors joined together.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be shaped according to the form of a star-shaped clau, and its points be shaped according to the form of dots of elischefigi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless it rubs with the heads joined together when they are infected, or a wide and broad mouth, and large it is.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Major form of the razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Medium form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Wide form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Form with which it is closed.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Other thin form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	End of other thin form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Small, thin form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Form with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Also great form of the razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a radio, and the end is like a saw: it is exhibited in many places from the bone-cutting edge.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Form which is joined to its edge that is pierced through from the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	End of it is triangular, acute are its ends.
Fit ex Indi.	Fits from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it is necessary that all which we have said of the razors, and incisers, and saws should be.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Regarding the cutting of ends, and the locking of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head LIII.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends putrifie, or for an extrinsic, or intrinsic cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	But when you have been healed with medicine, and there is no cure: and you see corruption inci
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	then that which is accidit to it is a sign, that the member is degraded, until it is cured: for fire has burned it, or has putrefied after decay: until it incides corruption on it, and it creeps into all the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore with the cutting of it, and likewise if the cause of corruption is from an impact of some venenous: as the sea-scorpion, and the nightingale-fly, and the nettle-tree, and the like.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore corruption, or impact is at the end of the finger, then cut the finger, and not leave space for corruption, that it may incide to the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise if it has happened in the hand, then cut it from the root of a sharp instrument, and not leave space for corruption, until it takes hold in the sharp arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if you have made an incision in it, then cut the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if corruption has spread and you see it around the elbow: then death is certain for that one.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And besides that cure, there is a quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And likewise do for the foot, when corruption has entered into the toe, then cut it at the knuckle joint: and if it enters into the sole of the foot, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends up to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	That if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no hope of recovery, except for amputation and to let go of the sick to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the mode of cutting the limb, or of bending it, is so that you hold the lower ligament, which you want to cut: and stretch another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one assistant stretch the lower ligament: and let another assistant stretch the upper ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a chisel blade, until the whole bone is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then cut it, or bend it.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it should be so that you put on all parts a linen cloth, and let not the saw touch the sound place: and make an incision into the sick with added blistering and heating.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if blood flows inward while you work, then quickly burn the place: or put on the body some powdery things that stop the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then turn back to your own medication, until it is finished.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament, and take care of it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to the man in his foot: this is the same thing that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because what happened to his foot was that it got burned with fire: and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it spread throughout the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Then he cut the vein from itself, having observed that a corruption was spreading to the limb with its trembling, which was due to pain and chills; and he cut it near the joint, and it healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after he had passed a long time, that corruption again came to his finger of his left hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me, and I tried to restore that excess with him when I placed on his hand from the medicines after purifying his body: and the excess did not respond, and it began to tremble in another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	So he called on me to cut his hand: and I did not want to do so, hoping from myself for a response to that excess: and I was afraid also of death upon his hand at the cutting.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the strength of the man was over his fall.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Afterwards he despaired of me, turned to his own land: and came to me about it, because he wished, and cut all his hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this narrative, except to be an aid in that which falls regarding this kind of disease: and to be a sign what means, and according as it is applied.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of gangrenous wounds, and on the quality of cauterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter X.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a gangrene occurs on some fleshly part of the body, and the apothecary's space is prolonged, until it makes the collection of pus: then it bursts, or pierces, and lets out what is in it, leaving behind an empty place like a pit: and the skin which is over it is as fine cloth which has been worn away: and does not spread to the last degree of corruption, nor impresses into the mouth, the nerves, or the ligaments: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and is not called a Fistula: however if it is prolonged, until it impresses corruption onto some of these limbs, then it is called a Fistula, or a tub.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its cure is to strike off that whole skin as it was turned over; and especially when it has been thinned out and made like a cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere and there follows from it no corruption: but if in the skin is a thickness of flesh, then its cure with Clister; and is, as you should consider to the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is great, and the pus which is discharged from it has a foul odor: then clisterize it with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and myrrh, parts receiving alike, mixed together in an ashpan; and let them boil on fire, until it turns red with the medicine: and let it come to a thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize it with it the Sinus: and tighten its orifice, and let the medicine flow into it for a time of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with an expression: let it be for days, until the Sinus is cleansed and the smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is clisterized with water of ash when this medicine is not present with you: and is, as you should take ash from wood of oak, or ash from holly-tree: and throw it on the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and clisterize it with it, until you trust that the Sinus is now washed away.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	That if the sick person does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine and water of ash, then clisterize it with water and honey, to which has already been added some crushed myrrh.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clisterize it with honey and wine, since of the property of honey is to cleanse and wash away: and the wine makes the Sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this a few times, and are confident that the sin has been cleansed away, then sterilize him with the poultice which he uses for birth.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And so take from the poultice a little piece of the size of an apple; and dissolve it with rose oil, and with wine-tar [i.e., wine mixed with tar]; or sterilize him with some medicines, and with other ointments whose properties I have written in my tract on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	That if the opening of the sinus is tight, in which the tube of the poultice does not enter: then make it larger with iron a little; or put into it licorice which has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it increases.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And likewise if the opening is also wide, then join the lips with a stitch; and let go from it the quantity with which the poultice is made without adding anything to it.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And likewise if the opening from which the pus runs is raised up towards the top: then dry him up in a lower place which is in himself, so that the pus may run down to below: for when the pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	That if you are not able to dry the sinus completely round below it according to your wish: then try to prepare the member in such a way that the pus runs out of it with ease, in accordance with how you prepare it for yourself.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to ensure that nothing of the pus remains in it at all; and take medicines which are used for the sign  [i.e., the poultice], suitable to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over the linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And have a piece of linen of such a size that it may communicate with all the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps in the direct opening of the sinus a hole which is somewhat larger than the orifice of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread over the other linen cloth, with a little quantity of ointment, in accordance with the size of the hole; and place it on the member at some distance from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be allayed: and do not remove the linen cloth, except after a few days.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	And yet who is above the sinus opening, he who is moved at all hours, so that it emerges from what is aggregated there from pus: and know that the virus which runs out of it is great or little; or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And consider again the place of the sinus itself, does the Lord feel pain there, or is there no pain in it, and is there a swelling there, or is there no swelling?
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Now when your treatment extends so long, and you see the matter that comes out over the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is already attached, or approaching attachment: then therefore حل it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you solve the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if the virus comes out of the sinus after a long interval, do not despair of its attachment, for its healing approaches, for there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who work in an opposite way.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if it comes out after many days with undigested pus, then know that the sinus is not attached.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	But if the attachment of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then add to the exudation of medicines, indeed let the doctors make their medicine so that it be in its substance moist, and in its virtue dry: just as the ointment of daphnes, when added thereto, adds a surplus with exudation.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the greatest one that is cured, it is, so that you take the ointment of daphnes, and dissolve it with rose oil, and rub it on the old wound equally in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then bind the unguent thereon, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And this same action is done by you when the ointment of daphnes is not present with you, when you boil it, until it thickens, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and olive oil: grind them all together, and powder it, and apply it to honey while it is on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then cut a strip of cloth long enough to go across the top of the wound, and tie it tightly across the Sinus: and with the mastic poultice which you have made, until it has thickened: and dust the wound with powder, and place it on the cloth, and tie it up.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes when it is given to him long herb aristequia, and the roots of sky-lily, and it is a lily; and barley flour, and centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or ground up, wash out, and sieve themselves: and dust over the honey which you have made, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the Sinus is prolonged, and not healed with this cure: then know that there is corruption in it: or now makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then heal the Sinus with the cure of Fistula, as has been said.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Về việc điều trị viêm niệu đạo và ngứa ran, và cắt ngón tay được thêm vào, và cắt
Caput XCI.	Đầu 71.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panarites là một vết viêm nhỏ xuất hiện dưới móng tay cái hoặc ngón tay, và có thể xuất hiện ở các ngón tay khác.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	Khi đó nếu tình trạng kéo dài và bị bỏ qua, và vết viêm trở nên nóng: hoặc nó bị hư hỏng, và tiết dịch nhầy, cho đến khi nó ăn mòn gốc của móng tay: và có thể nó hư hỏng toàn bộ, và có thể nó ảnh hưởng đến miệng, cho đến khi có mùi hôi thối: và làm tay bị cong, và màu của nó chuyển sang đen.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	Vì vậy khi bạn điều trị vết viêm đó, giống như đã nói ở trên về sự phân chia, và không có tác dụng chữa bệnh nào từ bạn: sau đó bạn cần phải cạo bỏ toàn bộ phần còn lại của móng tay.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Sau đó đun nóng kỹ mông sau khi điều trị.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Vì nhiệt độ cao là điều cần thiết cho việc chữa bệnh.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Nếu xương là lành và móng tay cũng lành, và các bổ sung lỏng mỏng đang ép vào mô bên trong, và nó bắt đầu đau: sau đó bạn cần phải đặt một thứ nguyên liệu nhỏ dưới góc của móng tay bị tổn thương, và đẩy nó lên: và cắt mô với sự dễ dàng, và đặt trên phần còn lại từ các loại thuốc đốt cháy, ăn mòn, cho đến khi toàn bộ bị hư hỏng.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then this ointment care, until he heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the decay has already impregnated the jaw, then one should break that jaw and remove it: for indeed it is not cured while it remains in it a corrupted jaw.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see the decay and the decay to run into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to what was said above in the introduction.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however the nail is torn or struck; and there is great pain, then it is necessary that you let blood at first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatulium, cutting across from above to the wound.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard it, so that the cutting does not reach the flesh which is under the nail; for you would make happen through that a very painful injury, and it would be a cause of birth of flesh added in place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then take care of the place with him who sits with that pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger, however, that is born in some hands of men, perhaps is flesh all over; and perhaps there are bones in it, and perhaps there is a nail: and in some of its joints perhaps the birth is in the joint root, or perhaps it is born in certain nodules of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	So then this which is born in some nodules of the finger does not move; and that which is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	That one, however, of these which is flesh, its section is easy to be made.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, so that you break it at its root with a spatulium blade.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the cure for this one of whose birth is at the joint root, is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	So then abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one, however, who is born in the finger at the very last joint, then it is necessary that you cut its first flesh round up to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then cut the bone with one of those saws convenient for that purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound, until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However the injury which has occurred to the fingers, often happens or from the birth of man, that is, he is born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or from a burn by fire and similar causes.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary to remove this callus, until the fingers recover their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a strip of linen, or cloth dipped in rose oil: so that they may not quickly join together and separate them: or place between them a thin piece of lead, until the place has healed as much as necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And likewise if the callus which has occurred to some of the fingers with the palm, then dry this callus, according to how it is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	§ On the Incision:The Defects.
Caput XCII.	On the right side of the neck, between the Adams's apple and the angle of the jaw, there is a small opening, through which, if necessary, a straw or a needle may be inserted, to drain away any fluid that may accumulate in the throat; and in order that the skin may not be stretched tight, it should be marked from the corner of the mouth to the corner of the jaw, so as to form a kind of V. When this incision has been made, it is advisable to insert into it a large needle, so that, if necessary, any fluid which may collect in the throat may be drained away; but before doing this, care should be taken to see that the tongue does not get in the way, and then the needle should be withdrawn. When the incision has been made, care must be taken not to pierce through to the windpipe.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins that are deep-lying, large, and full of melancholy superfluity which occur in many parts of the body; and most of these veins are found in the legs, especially in those who walk much or work hard, and carry loads upon them.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary that you should administer a strong treatment for the body from black cholera sometimes with a strong vomiting.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then, take a bowl of wine mixed with water, and keep it at hand.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment for these veins with iron is done in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of these methods is, so that they should sit and black blood should be drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is, so that a vein should be cut and all of it should be drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section is truly performed in this way.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Now wrap the leg with warm water a lot until the thick, foul-smelling blood resolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tighten the bandage around the leg from the upper side of the hip all the way down to the knee with the wound exposed.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry one, or two, or three wide sections in a single place.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then pour [the liquid] out, that is, draw blood from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and from the upper part let it flow onto the wound, so that the bleeding is first stopped.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the leg all the way down: until you see an amount of blood that is sufficient, and which the strength of the wound-keeper allows.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it up: and command him to refrain from foods that cause black cholesterol: and again instruct the patient to drain and draw blood when the veins are filled, and if it hurts the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation is performed in this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Scrape the wound, if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then dip the wound into a bath: or wrap it in the leg of the patient with warm water until it turns red, and the veins burst: or exercise it vigorously if there is no bath available, until it warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin in the direction of the wound along its length: or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a knife, and scrape the wound from all sides until it feels smooth: and you will see that it turns from red to black as it heals.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When you have thus washed the skin, you will see that it is white as a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then dip it under [the liquid], until it comes out and dries on the skin: hang it with a smooth, soft hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another wide section next to that one with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then he removed the scabs from the upper part of the wound until it appeared.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then he washed her with water and soap, as you have done, and hung her up by the feet with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then he dried a different section, or multiple sections, if you are able to do so.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then wash it again, and cut the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove it by pulling on the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this, until you have completely removed it from the upper section; then cut it, or with longer sections, until you have cut through all of it when it has come loose: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you when you try to remove and wash it: then insert a strong double thread under it, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert the Radium underneath: and turn your hand around all sides of it, until it has come loose.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful that you do not cut yourself.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it cuts, it is difficult for you to wash it well, and it enters into the body and causes damage.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have completely removed it: then place it on a wound-bed that has been soaked with wine and oil and sprinkled with rose water, or just oil; and take care of it, until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	Now if the vine is contracted, and has a twist to it that lies in the way of the parts, and it is not like what we have said above in regard to the straightness: then you must find under it all the part of its twist, and the locations of its winding.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang it up with a hook until you have washed it all over; and be careful not to hit the section on your leg while washing it, or to cut yourself, for it will be difficult to wash well or remove from you.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	So then you are cautious.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of injury that heals the vine.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of wound that is not healing well.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uullerent venam: et est grossae flexuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret venam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.
Caput XCIII.	De extractione Venae cruris internae ut in femore, ut in thora ut in braschi ut in brachi ut in cubiti.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	Caput XCI.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	De extractione Venae femoris internae, & ad sinus uti.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	Caput XCII.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	De extractione Venae cruris externae, ad sinus uti.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Et hoc facit ut superesset, si ubi fuit et si longus est, sicut in femore: qui enim est longior a brachi, et non tantum a cubito, sed et ad pedem.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Et hoc facit ut superesset, si ubi fuit et si longus est, sicut in femore: qui enim est longior a brachi, et non tantum a cubito, sed et ad pedem.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	Et si Vena non possit ueni sua per se, et concidit in locos circumcrines, in quibus sunt moxae venarum, ut in thora, ut in braschi, ut in cubiti: tunc concidebit in locos illas moxis.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Et si Vena non possit ueni sua per se, et concidit in locos circumcrines, cum moxae venarum sunt: tunc concidebit in locos illas moxis.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	Et si Vena non possit ueni sua per se, et concidit in locos circumcrines, cum moxae venarum sunt: tunc concidebit in locos illas moxis.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not hit it with the root before it has gone out completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you hit it, it will be bruised, and it will go into the flesh: and it will cause an ulcer to form, and decay in place, and a bad wound.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it should be handled gently, and removed slowly, until it has gone out completely from its last part, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this comes a vein that runs in some men for five palms and ten fingers.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has come to me, because it has gone out through twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if you hit it during your treatment time: then introduce the root into its hole, and pierce it with a long one through the flesh, until all that is in it is removed out of it: and administer decay to the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care for yourself in curing those ulcers.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this Vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many openings, and goes out from every opening a branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	So take care for her, as we have said in the division, and with what is preceded.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Regarding the section about worms that are born under the skin, and it is called Bad Disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter CCIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This Disease is called in our language Bad Disease: because it often happens to worms, and there is one little worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it moves in the whole body, going up and down: and it is felt by the sense when it walks on its limbs, until it breaks off at every break in the skin, and goes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from decay of certain kinds of earth.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in the belly, do.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And he fears her wickedness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when he himself examined the body, and raised it up to the head, and came to a place: then perhaps it opened within him, and he departed, and destroyed his eye: and this has happened often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	But when you are treating him, and taking him out, then that thing does not happen except with his walking, and the sensation of it itself.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, you should hold what is above him, and what is under him with a strong constriction by the ligament.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry up on top of him, and take him out.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	That if it sinks into the flesh, and not into his whole body: then put a place on top of the spot with fire, until he dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater is what he fears, is her corruption, which corrupts his eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see him having already come to the head near the eye, then hold below him with a good constriction by the brow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry up on top of him, and take him out.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that he should use his own self-cleansing with the medicines which are dissolving the bad humors of his body.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of food that generates putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the section about disease of Naquir.
Caput XCV.	Head 105.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called in our country Naquir, and it is a pain that happens to some member, and then it changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed I have already seen him, according to what I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in some parts of the body.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she held out her arm, and I saw swelling in the armpit of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw one swelling go up with fire, like the swelling of a wound, going faster than it is possible to go: so that it was like running silver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain then came from that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then after one hour, it slid into the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that he was shaking all over his body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	So I was amazed at the speed of its movement from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed before that I had not seen this sickness with my eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	But I saw many who were suffering from pain that was moving from one limb to another: and I did not see him with my eyes, as I saw him in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it was, unless it is because that woman was from those who are born with scaly skin on their faces: hence this appears to be the reason for that movement of pain.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary so that it does not appear in this way in those who are healthy and have moist bodies, hidden scaliness of the skin.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When then you are healing him, and the patient feels pain: if it appears to your eye, as we have said, then squeeze him on top, and under him quickly: and dry him on top until that movement is stopped: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see him with your eyes: then take care of his body with scalding, and with it what expels movements, and with pilules that turn them red, and with those made from nettle, and the like.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Regarding the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter LVI:
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their kind, and according to the places from which they come out of the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	But there is a different kind: for some have large points, and some are sharp: and some are conic, and some are flat.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And of these there are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And of these are the tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And from these are made stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	These indeed which are according to the members in which they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or indeed the members are from the main members conjoined, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lungs, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and these similar to them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into one of these members, and you see the signs of death which I shall tell you about, then you should extract that star from them, because death follows it in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when those bad signs do not appear to you, and the star is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For from the signs when the star falls into the brain, and penetrates the bone, and exits asiphe which is above the brain, it is: for these occur from that caustic soda, and scotoma, and vertigo, and reddening of the eyes, and inflammation, and reddening of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of thought, and forgetfulness of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps it exits blood from the nostrils, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is severed, and the word is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And exits from the wound's place a white, pulpy moisture.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And exits from that similar to the moisture of meat.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore you see these signs, then refrain from treatment, and extract the star if it has not exited.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the star when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple: and feels as if it were fixed in a hard place, not in a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the star has a movement similar to pulsation: and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And follows that coldness of extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting fits.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know then, that death has certainly come.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it pierces the lung, is a frothy issue from the armpit; and the veins that follow the neck, are distended and their color changes with the nurse.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out great wind, deep; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	That if the arrow falls into a wound, which is within the chest: then it is near the ribs little; and it makes a great sighing with pain, and a deep sighing: and all the limbs of the shoulders do move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it will expel something undigested from food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly, and is fixed there: it expels something from the armpit, or the rectum, or the intestine which is already broken.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore there is no hope in curing him, nor in drawing out the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	That if an arrow falls into the bladder, and expels urine: and proceeds from it something towards the outside, and its pain is stronger on the sick: then you shall know that it is deadly.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The rest of the limbs, as the face, and the neck, and the throat, and the spoons, and the support, and the spine, and the knees, and the feet, and things similar to the limbs are healed according to many dispositions: for if an arrow does not hit a blood vessel, or a nerve: and that arrow is not deadly.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I saw of these arrows, that it may be a sign for your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That if an arrow falls into the tear duct of a man's eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	And I drew it out for him by the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and there came no harm to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I drew out another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen into his fat under his lower eyelid: and that arrow was hidden, and I could not get it out unless I cut off part of his cheekbone; and it was a great arrow among arrows of the Turks, with a soft iron; in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew is therefore healthy, and no bad accident has befallen his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I took another arrow out of the quiver of the Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And that was an Arabic arrow, and it is the one which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I followed behind her between two spears, and she was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was subtle with her, until I pulled her out: and the Christian was healthy.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I took another arrow from the man who had fallen into his belly; for we thought that he would die of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	Afterward, however, I waited thirty days for any change in his condition, then followed behind him with the arrow; and when I had passed it over him, I looked upon it, and took it out; and he was healthy, and no bad accident happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom the arrow had fallen on his back, and it was healed over; there was a wound on him.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Afterward, however, he came out of prison after seven years, and the arrow had come out of the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom the arrow had fallen into her belly, and it was healed over; and the arrow remained within her: nor did she change by any means from her natural disposition, nor did the woman perceive any hurt in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, to whom the arrow had fallen on his face; and it was healed over, and remained there, not causing him much pain; and similar things happened to many others.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I took out the arrow of the king's princes, which had fallen on his nose and was falling toward the right side a little; and the arrow was hidden all away.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So I was called to cure him after the loss of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	And I found the arrow's string very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	So he himself felt a prick and pain on his right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that that was a spot from the tip of the bow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore hoped that that was a spot from the tip of the arrow. So I laid a plaster on the place with the plaster in which there was attracting and healing power, confiding to myself that the place would heal, and it appeared to me as a sign of the bow so that I should cut over it: and no accident happened in that place indicating that the arrow had followed the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	So I endured with the plaster on it for many days: and no accident happened, and the bone was healed in between: and it remained ill from the space of taking it out for a day or two, until he felt the arrow one day in his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I put on that broken bone an acute medicine, enduring for many days until it was healed open: and when I tried to move it, I felt a little spot of the arrow which held on to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added in the opening of the wound with that acute medicine, until we could see clearly the end of the arrow: and passed from me with that time space of about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then when the bone had healed well, and it was possible for me to insert my fingers into it, and move them, and it did not comply with going out: then I did not cease to probe gently, and devise over it by means of devices, until one day I got it out with bent pins, according to the form of their shape at the end of the shaft, until I took it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the bone.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And those who medicate judge, that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	So I restored it, and the bone was healed, and the injury was healed with a complete health: and he did not hurt him in anything at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you the quality of the extraction of some arrows: to put that rule and sign over it, which I did not mention.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not contained in the narration; nor does this book contain them, and the prudent craftsman compares little to much: and as much as is present, he has compared it to what is absent: and found a new operation and a new instrument from descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say then that arrows do not come out of the body parts in which they are fixed, except according to two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite part of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which has come out from where it entered, either is an arrow going in a fleshy place: and is attracted and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	That if it does not comply with the exit at the time at which it falls: then you must let it alone for a few days, until it rotten the flesh that is around it: and the attraction of it will be eased, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if it is stuck in a bone and does not comply with you to come out, then let it go as well for a few days: and again bring it out with attraction and movement every day, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	That if it does not comply with you to come out after a few days, then you must cut off the sagitta from the bone completely with a sharp tool, until the arrow is enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it and pull it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in a skull bone and has already gone into one of the vents of the cerebral bone, and appears as one of those disorders that I have mentioned: then you should refrain from attracting the arrow and let it go, until it gets used to being there after a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the brain, then death does not delay for long.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of a bone and has not entered as far as the brain: and remains sick for a few days, and does not happen to him any of those disorders: then use your craft in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If it is fixed tightly, and does not obey you when you try to pull it: then apply terebinth resin around the area of the wound, as you have told me: then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If the arrow is already deeply embedded in the body, and hidden and concealed from sight: then try to find it with your touch.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then pull it gently with some tools that are suitable for pulling.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot get above it due to the constriction of the skin, and because of the length of the arrow deep within: and there is no bone, or nerve, or blood vessel there: then find a way above it, until the bone becomes enlarged, and it becomes possible to pull out the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	That if they are ears that are being held on, then free the flesh tightly held in them from all sides, with any device you can: and devices, if it is not possible to release the flesh in a fracture of the ears, and their contortion, until it heals.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is located, then use your twisted hands to twist it in all parts until it heals: and with the utmost care, so that the arrow does not break, and becomes difficult for you to attract it, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	That if you cannot get above it in one hour, then leave it for a few days, until what is around it putsrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for it will be relieved with poultices. But if the opposite happens to you, and the flow of blood is increased: then administer what we said in our book on treatment: and protect your skill from cutting into bone, or a nerve, or a tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer devices in any way that you can to ease the removal of the arrow: and let it be with ease, and peace, or slowness, and strength, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is fitting that, when you pull out the arrow, it should be with a twist, so that it is injured according to its position, as it was located on the body with the arrow.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For he is more skilled.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if you are not able to do that, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow that goes out from the opposite side, or has already gone out a little toward the outside: or makes a bump at the extreme end of the dart by feeling from the upper part of the skin near it, and you see it standing out: so cut it up, and make a section according to the quantity that it holds in it the darts.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then attract it: for it becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it holds itself in the bone, then turn your hand according to its roundness, until it presses the dart into the bone, and makes it strong for itself: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let it go for a few days: then examine it again, until it goes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	That if the wood of the dart is in it, then push it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if it has fallen on the wood, and you are to administer a push: then introduce into it an instrument that is sharp, so that the sharpness of it enters into the tail of the dart: then push it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the dart is pushed together, then push it out with an instrument that goes into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the dart is relieved through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	That if the dart is poisoned, then it is necessary, so that you do not become poisoned yourself: for this you can do if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with that which comes into contact with that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	That if the dart is falling into the chest, or the belly, or the groin, and it is close to that which you feel by trying, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut off, and be careful not to make an incision in the vein, or in the nerve, and pull it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, if you see it, and take care of that, until it heals up.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps, with which are extracted arrows.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	May their ends be similar to the face of a wedge, made like an iron; when they grasp onto the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are made from them many species, great and small, and middle ones, according to the quantity of the size of the arrow, and its thinness or thickness, and the constriction thereof.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	This is the form of the impeller.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And this is the form of the impeller of lead.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the end of the lead-shaped impeller as an aid to entry into the hole made in the cone-shaped arrow, and it is driven with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This end of the lead-shaped impeller cone-shaped is concave as a feather's tip: that it may aid the entry of the arrow into itself and its impulsion.

Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	But the veins which are phlebotomised in the thigh, are those in which phlebotomy was customary in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy is done on them according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by puncturing with the phlebotome on one side: or by oiling to the sensitivity of the decline: or by cutting with the phlebotome with an awl, and it is Anelesius.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Anelesius is, which is suitable for the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are species broad, and according to the width of their veins and their form the phlebotomy with the awl is broad, like you see it.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening closed veins, full, returning, visible, thick, and those which contain thick blood, turbulent.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is smaller in width, and more delicate at the extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain citrinin blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	¶ Of the Basilica phlebotomy.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	But the Basilica, which is one of the three veins phlebotomised, is the iuuamentum.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	For it draws blood from the diseases which are under the throat and the neck, because it follows the chest and the abdomen: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist to cut it with the phlebotome, in order that he may beware, and be on his guard, for under it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If then he should err, and he adds to the puncturing of the phlebotomy, he will strike the artery, and will spill the flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it should not be phlebotomised with the phlebotome while puncturing: but rather cut with Anelesius while cutting.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	That if the Basilica does not appear by manifest sign, then you should separate it, and turn to another, or seek some branch of it: or make a phlebotomy in place of its Funem brachii.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For this is manifest, and cut her with the phlebotome Anelesius, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you want to use phlebotomy on him, then you should do so before tightening the bandage on his arm, so that you can feel for the pulse first.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with encaustic, then the arm, and dry it with a Concave Scalp Razor, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And make sure that the pulse does not drop through the space from the site of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see it, when you tighten the ligature, the swelling at the spot you marked with the encaustic, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: so remove it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	That if you see blood rise during phlebotomy, like urine in a boy, and it is thin blood, red: then you will know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore place your hand on the spot for a long time, and then remove your hand.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	But if blood is cut away (for it is often cut away) then tighten the arm, and let him go: and beware of his movement, and sit with him on guard.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not move for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not cut away and weakens you: and there is no present medicine for you at your hand, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its ends do convulse, and blood is cut away.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the cork of a bottle, and find it: take half, and tighten it over the spot of the wound with a bandage and powder until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is cut away, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	Then if not: then care for the man with what follows from the spot of the powder that blood was cut away: and cutting away his blood is not difficult in many positions, because of the small wound, and possibility of a bandage off the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On phlebotomy of the vein of the foot.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The vein of the head and neck is the vein that draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body; for this reason it is composed of the branch of the basilica and the branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it comes to the phlebotomist so that he be above the fear from his phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	But if he adds to the puncturing of the phlebotomy, and finds the nerve, it happens that he is stunned, and difficult is his recovery from it, and perhaps does not completely recover.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears many times to touch.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is concealed in some people, and it is thin, and does not show itself: then you should put your phlebotomy there where you phlebotomize, with the section of the alne, and away from the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	That if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the cerebral vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	But the phlebotomy of the cerebral vein is a phlebotomy because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to the ailments of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein your own, if you want, that you phlebotomize it piercing with the phlebotomy olive oil, or with the phlebotomy myrrh: for this is a savior of all veins, because it is not a sub arterial vein, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	But it is necessary to you at the phlebotomy, that you bring with the phlebotomist only the head of the lock, and you will ask for a more indulgent place: and it does not hurt him, if first it is not discovered by tapping, so that it returns on it with the phlebotomy from time to time.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	But perhaps is accustom'd in some people when it is not phlebotomized in the first tapping, but it does not hurt him that thing, if that accustom'd is made at some time.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Of the utility of Phlebotomy and the precautions with which you observe it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality then of Phlebotomy, and the accidents thereof out of which it is necessary to consider rectifying.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First therefore of its concerning which it is necessary thou shouldest know, that Phlebotomy is not administered, except for the preservation of health, and perseverance thereof, and caution from the advent of sickness.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that Phlebotomy be made in one of three which are in the bed, namely Cephalica, and Fusca, and Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that Phlebotomy be made in the beginning of Spring on a fast, in a day, and in summer: and in autumn, and winter after a feast, when there appear signs of satiety.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And that Phlebotomy be made in the first day, or in the third, after three hours have passed since the last day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But Phlebotomy which is administered in sickness has not a determined hour; but when it provokes convenience and necessity thereto, in the night, or day, and at all hours, and in all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary that Phlebotomy be made on boys until they have reached the age of fourteen years.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor let Phlebotomy be made on a pregnant woman until the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor let Phlebotomy be made on old men who have already passed their sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When therefore anyone wishes to be Phlebotomized, it is necessary that he should wash his bowels before Phlebotomy with a soft clister, if in them there is much retained dung: so that the intestines do not attract phlebotomy from the putrid excrements hurting the main members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor let Phlebotomy be made on a patient who is fainting with nausea: nor let him be drenched by wine from drunkenness until he has removed that from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor let Phlebotomy be made on a sick person with hydrops.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let Phlebotomy be made again after a feverish passion, and vomiting, and a flow of blood, and an increase in the number of copulations, and labor, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and all that dissolves virtue out of the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider in the subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if possible to him that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then introduce the bath, if he does not prohibit anything: or let him exercise himself in some exercise, that the blood may be refined.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And put the phlebotomy of his in his bosom, about the third day, as we have said: and be careful, that the chest of him that day shall be drained of all animal bad accidents: such as anger, fear, and pain: and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, punishment, and excesses, and those like them.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make his own things to be present with those wherewith custom of men is used of aromatic, and of odor, and of mirth, and similar things by quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomizer sit on a tray that is higher than the phlebotomy tray: then let him take his arm out, and rub it with the hand of the phlebotomizer twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tie a ligature with the thong, and let him wind it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be tempered, because the constriction is not equal, or by surplus in the constriction, then it prohibits the course of blood: or in softening, then also it prohibits the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, let the phlebotomizer rub his hands together at once, until they are blistered, and let them feel with touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the phlebotomizer wipe off the phlebotomy with a little oil, his own ancient one.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let him put his index finger of his left hand on the vein at the spot where he intends to phlebotomy, a little: so that blood does not flee, and the veining is heard with a snap.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from the veins is what is like a running string when phlebotomy: and those are full of blood: and when you put the phlebotomy on it, it is hit by the phlebotomy, and deceives the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is tight: therefore, for this reason, let the phlebotomizer firm it, and be alert in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then place the phlebotomy device.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then a new vein opens from one edge, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that cut under that place a little, or above it with eagerness: if the spot does not stop bleeding.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	That if it stops bleeding, or the patient feels pain, then let him go for a day, or two days: and do not tie a ligature tightly.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For maybe the heat draws away the blood.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And do not put him in a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the phlebotomy if he loves it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	That if the cut is small, or blood runs slowly: and be careful that not a little amount of blood comes out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole according to its length, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it quickly, before that spot stops bleeding: for that spot may stop bleeding in many people during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If then you see that the spot has already stopped bleeding, then do not repeat the phlebotomy at all, for it does not excuse with you to make a mistake.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place on the spot some of the fat oil: for it soothes the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And this oil is better in this place than the person's own oil, and better than another kind of oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And also administer fat oil in all your phlebotomies when the blood course is to be stopped: and make it with myrrh and saffron when placed from one of those oils on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	That if a great apotheosis happens at the place of phlebotomy, for many times it happens, especially if he is not phlebotomized except in that very hole, or there is a small cut open, then mend and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly warmed up: and tighten it for an hour: for it is resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	It is appropriate that you should do this after the blood has gone from the wound with its own supply, or from another new one.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	That if anything remains in the place after a few days of blackening or swelling, it does not harm that: and if there is a pus, put something on top of it of aloe, or dissolved myrrh: or some of the juice of mint, that is, calamus or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times indeed have there occurred hemorrhoids and eminences at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So put your hand on it, and then if it is a soft swelling under your pressure upon it, then that eminence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Cause therefore that you put something on it from that which we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps it will flow out of her blood from the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for her with that where there is a stenosis, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is appropriate that you should draw out all blood from every person according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the vibrant color on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it not go out, until it reddens: and likewise if you see it thick: then let it go out, until it thins out: and also if it is sharp, then let its sharpness be taken away.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is appropriate that he who is full, strong, and resistant to the extraction of blood by one stroke, so that the phlebotomy of the new blood may be increased, and the phlebotomist on the side: but in him who is weak, opposite to that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is appropriate that he should draw out the wound with strokes, and that there should be a tight opening: and better is what is administered in the phlebotomy of the new blood, that it should be a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this way of phlebotomy is salutary by the flow of blood, and from the incisions of the nerves: and it is more praiseworthy and healthier than phlebotomy by the width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And he who is accustomed to syncope during phlebotomy, it is appropriate that he eat a little bread infused with water of pomegranates before phlebotomy; or if he is warm, he should drink cold water; and he should extract the blood from him in three or four vessels.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if his complexion is cold, then he should take before phlebotomy bread infused with syrop of myrrh, or with syrop of honey flavored with spices, or with scented syrop.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	That if syncope should happen during phlebotomy, and it is the cause of the outflow of blood in great quantity: then he should drink in a vessel water of meat, and syrop of fragrant things: and he should apply aroma with algarobie resin, and open his chest while doing so: and he should use whatever we have mentioned in the division [of the treatment] of syncope from the removal of blood.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wants to release his arm, and let his blood flow: it is appropriate for him who has phlebotomy because of great removal, and whose power is weak, that he should let his blood flow little by little through the quantity of power in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wants to release his arm, and let his blood flow twice, and his body is strong: then he should do this after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side of which he declines: it is appropriate that he be released in the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much blood that has been warmed and has increased in heat, and causes fever: it is appropriate that he go out from it in a single stream, and extract a great quantity: and increase the opening until syncope happens: after you have preserved all the conditions of phlebotomy: and put your hand on his pulse at the site of the blood flow, so that death does not happen at the place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For many times this has happened, when the phlebotomizer does not know, and falls by negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not appropriate that when you want to heal the arm, and you draw blood secondarily, when the opening of the intestine has already been closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, so that it precipitates quickly on it with a movement, and it is curved and extends rapidly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is an evil thing, in advance let go of him, until he is bled secondarily.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or move with the sharpness of phlebotomy that which has been coagulated from blood in the opening of the intestine, and place on it some dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place on it some of the tar of Alfarach, or sage green, and place the body under a soft compression, until the blood exits.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the intestine has already broken open, then let go of it, and do not seal it, until it heals.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	That if necessity compels to draw blood secondarily, and there is no excuse, then either bleed the body above that place, or in an arm on another intestine.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the cord of the arm is bled at the place of the purple vein, and the basilic vein, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that he puts his own hand into hot water, until it turns red, and the intestine appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then let it be tied over it with a little constriction of the middle thread.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then bleed secondarily little by little, not lengthwise, and not along the length: and let the opening be wide, and let your bleeding be slight as you bleed it over the wristband a little bit.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	That if the exit of blood is prevented, then repeat the hand into hot water, and let the blood run into the water, until you meet the need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from repeating the hand into hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed a great deal of blood is put into hot water in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And phlebotomy of this vein is salutary for all veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the right hand is salutary for those who suffer from liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that you should bind the wrist with a strap or your hand after you have inserted it into hot water, until the vein contracts, and it is very noticeable.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then phlebotomize it by passing through it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not hurt him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And keep your hand away from the phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Because under it are naked nerves of the fingers stripped of their flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat the hand to hot water, and let the blood run in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat the hand in hot water, the blood will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and its course is prevented.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you extract a quantity of blood as needed, then place it on the vein with oil and salt: so that it does not solidify quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise you should do, so that you make with every strict branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The phlebotomy of the left hand is salutary for those who suffer from splenic diseases: and likewise do with its phlebotomy, as you have done with the second, equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is salutary for those diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the kidneys and retention of the menses, diseases of the kidneys and bladder stones, old sores of the buttocks and legs, and other diseases from the lower parts of the body.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that you should insert the injured foot into hot water: and make a friction on it until the veins contract: and bind above the ankle with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the place of the vein is near the heel, apparent towards the thumb: and many branches emerge from it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Phlebotomy therefore cut it on a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its gathering: since it is better and more salutary.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	That if phlebotomy cut it on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are under it over the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy there where you want to cut it from behind, so that you may not cut it: and let the phlebotomist be.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the blood should come out, then turn her other foot to warm water: and let the blood not flow into it, until it has drained.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	That if there is an error in the phlebotomist's first cut, then he should keep with the phlebotomy to the upper part somewhat, for the place is salutary, and do not leave it with malice when you cut the nerves as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And also with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the place of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the side of the bush.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the binding of her phlebotomy is, to the pain of the ankle, when it is because of hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of her phlebotomy is, that it should enter into a weak bath and cheer up: and tighten her leg from the side of the ankle to above the heel with four fingers, for it does not appear except because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it then appears, then phlebotomy her according to whatever skill you are able, or according to the transfer: and it is better, or as if you were to cut her with an incision, or separate her with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the place of her is salutary, and she herself is secret for many people greatly.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	That if you do not feel it at all: then phlebotomy some branch of her, and that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and be careful of the nerves, and let the blood flow in a quantity as much as you want.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then untie the tourniquet, and place the skin over the venipuncture site, and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For this reason the wound is healed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	[Concerning] Ventilation, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventilation is produced from horns, and from air, and from heat.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And ventilation is produced in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When there is scarring and removal of blood: and the other is ventilation without scarring.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventilation without scarring is produced in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And those ventilations that are administered with scarring and removal of blood are four-and-twenty parts of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of these four are the places of the body where ventilation is administered with scarring and removal of blood: the first is ventilation of the crown of the head; and alkhel, which is in the center of the neck; and al-hadha-im, which are two laminae of the neck on both sides at the same time; and ventilation of the mind, which is under the mandible in the lower jaw; and ventilation of the two spatulas; and ventilation of the tail end of the two bones; and ventilation of the two brahs on either side; and ventilation of the two knees; and ventilation of the two shins.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed [the ventilation] does not remove blood from your small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and because of this its power does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	And it is not necessary that ventilation be administered with fire, or without fire in any illness that is caused by filling up, until the whole body is emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity calls for ventilation on account of illness, or out of custom, we shall administer it at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any other time.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is, for there is a man who, when the blood multiplies in him, until it is removed by ventilation, finds in his head a black spot, and becomes dizzy.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from these it is that he finds repletion and redness in his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from these it is that he finds itching in his face, forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from these it is that he scrapes the place of his wound.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from these it is that the laughter of the people multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from these it is that he finds the taste of blood in his mouth, or spits it out with his tongue, and spits out the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from these it is that his dream increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from these it is that he sees in his sleep blood and redness, and slain men, and plagues, and things like them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When then do we see anything from them, and especially if it is in the third month: let us then make the wound heal, after having passed two or three hours from daylight.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	But the sign of wound healing of the back is this: for it brings weight upon the head and drips down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But indeed let it be after the whole body has been emptied.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this itself is a ventose place of cerebral phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it should not be used by those with a cold complexions or who are hoarse.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And for this reason it should not be used by the elderly, and not by those who have cold diseases in their heads.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever persists in using it develops forgetfulness.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason you should tell the ventose to place his hand with the back of his palm facing downward, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventose or alkohl is a place of cerebral phlebotomy, and cerebral phlebotomy, and for this reason it brings asma (asthma), constriction of the windpipe, and openings of the windpipe instrument, and coughs, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	It is fitting that Ventosa Alchehel be given a little push, for if it is put down lower, it generates weakness in the heart and the stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosation however causes pains in accidents of the head and eyes and headaches and perforations and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is a place for phlebothomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is fitting that you warn the person who performs ventosation not to touch the skin with the blade so as not to hit an artery and cause a bloodflow.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	But if ventosation is done under the chin it causes salivation in the mouth and corruption of the gums and similar ailments that are in the mouth; and it is a place for phlebotomy in the middle part, which is found in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	But if ventosation with a spatula is done, it leads to pain in the cheek, which occurs from a rebound and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	But if ventosation is done inside the two parts, it creates phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica and Fusca and Cephalica: for those three veins themselves attract blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh; and these smaller veins attract the blood from the larger veins until they reach the attraction of the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	It is fitting that you warn the person who performs ventosation not to go too deep with the scarification, for the place is naked of flesh and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But if ventosation is done over the Alchaus, it causes hemorrhoids in the anus and ulcers at the bottom.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	It is fitting that you warn the person who performs ventosation that there should be a strong suction and that the material used should be of iron, for the place does not like to be tight and maybe the small ventosations break: and it is scarified with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	But if the ventosations of the feet are reduced in size, they cause a visible decrease: for they attract blood from all over the body and bring pains to the ancient veins in the kidneys and membranes and bladder: which cause menstruation and prostration and convulsion; and they are a place for phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and the alhorcobene.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, the body becomes very weak, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the wind between the two craniums is close to the wind of the two krurams.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the vents is that you put the vent in the first place, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the vents, but put them quickly, and shake them quickly so that the humors come to the place of entrance equally: and do not cease to repeat that and continue, until you see the place already turn red and swell, and appear as a rubor of blood: then therefore make an incision, and repeat suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is among men of tender flesh, rare pores, it is necessary that you make the incision once only, not more: lest the place be ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And order the vent-maker to amplify the incision and make it deep: and temper the suction in ease, and velocity, and motion of water.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	That if there is a crudeness in the blood, then it is necessary that you make the incision twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In fact, in the first place, a path of subtilization of the blood is opened, and it is made to be water-like: and in the second place, an intense probing for the extraction of gross blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	But if the blood is very foul, then let the incision be made in a fourth place: that it may bring about the last result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the last, when we have extracted the blood little by little, or no more, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	That if we desire extraction of much blood, then let us make multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that incision be made deeply: and an equal end in the incision, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which it is necessary to administer from oils at the disposition of the vents, and what cauterizes the vents?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the season of winter, then let the places of wind be anointed with oil of narcissus, or oil of lilies, or oil of chamomile, or absinthe: and to these are similar.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	But if there is a surplus of cold, then let the places of wind be anointed with oil of amber, or oil of balsam, or oil of alburnum, or oil of annatto: and to these are similar.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	But if the wind is strong and the pores are wide and the flesh is soft: then it is necessary that you should refrain from oil, and let these places be washed after the application of the oil with rosewater, or with cold water, or with water of the sun, or with water of the cucumber fruit, or with water of the portulaca plant: and similar to these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But he whose blood is of much moisture let him wash the wound with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and of sumach: and similar to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But if there is a surplus of moisture, then let him wash his wound with old wine, or with water of sorrel, or with a decoction of alfalfa, or of chamomile: and similar to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the application of the oil should be in a bath, or in a washing place: and also that it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that anyone should sleep after the application of the oil.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is needed so that he may be cured who has a wound to be treated, or who has blood to be drawn before the application of the oil?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	Et post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigрантia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And after that, it is necessary that you consider in the first place: then if the person is prone to wind or phlebotomy, it is necessary that his blood be sharp and inflamed: then it is necessary that he take cooling things, such as pomegranate juice: and also mustard with vinegar and lettuce, and sekaniabin, and iuleb: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And for those who are complexed by cold, it is necessary that they take in a drink of syrup of honey, or of alms, or of sekaniabin made from seeds: and they should take red wine with an odor, which is between new and old: and let it be prescribed that they use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put before him food for his appetite, and birdbread: and let him eat, that is, a few birds: and let him eat pigeon loaves.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink for wind and phlebotomy be more than food: and it is necessary that it be given in some wine to certain people at times of tyrocha (a kind of wine), or a remedy made from musk, that is, muscat, or alselith before wind: and before phlebotomy, or after, so as to comfort the principal parts of the body, and subtilize the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they drink it hot in a drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Wind without Scarring.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	The Winds that are without Scarring, are Winds that are placed on the liver, and the spleen, and the stomach, and over the bowels, and the navel, and the places of the testicles, and the pixidem (a type of fish): for these parts of the body do not suffer from scarring.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not questioned about them, unless there is an attack from one part of the blood to another part: as we place the Wind on the breasts in a flux of blood from the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And so we use them to relieve cold, sore flesh on a limb: as we put warm cloth over the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself tightens the limb, and warms it, and takes away the pain, because it relieves the coldness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys, when there is a deposit of filth upon them, or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by its own power, perhaps, it opens the deposit, or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And so too when placed over the liver, and the spleen at the same time, to relieve swelling within them both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these Wind-remedies are administered with a cut only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And at times they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And at times they are administered with warm water in pleural ailments: and that is to fill the Wind-remedy, and make it great, with just warm water, or with water in which certain herbs have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the Wind-remedies administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Its opening should be made wide enough to admit two fingers, according to the form we have described: and the quantity of it in the depth should be half an inch, and in its side, at about its middle, a small hole, according to the quantity which is put into it: let it be made of copper, or brass, broad-edged, smooth, equal, and triangular: that it may not hurt the limb by its position upon it: and let there be a cross-bar of copper, or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this great Wind-remedy may be made, larger than we have described, and that smaller one, according to the disease and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For those remedies are different for boys, and for those who are decrepitous, as the Wind-remedies are for men, and for those with big bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	But the quality of placing this Wind-remedy with fire on a limb, is, that you kindle a small candle from hay, or a bit of straw, and put it under the middle of the cross-bar of the Wind-remedy: that the fire may be all around its lower part, so that it does not burn the patient's body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then let it be placed on the limb; and the finger let be placed over the opening which I have said, until we hold the wound wet: while we are waiting, let us take away the finger, and vapor shall come out through that opening, and the wound shall be quickly soaked with moisture.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then let him be treated with leech-venom according to its custom, and again if he desires it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in the wind-disease [pleurisy] which is treated with water, there is no need to cross the thread, nor is any opening made; but it is only to be filled with water and placed on the limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his manner.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this [method] of Wind-disease is the better, in so far as it may take in much water, for that reason.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	The suspension of Blood-sugar [a treatment?].
Caput XCIX.	Head 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	The Blood-sugar is not to be given in many cases, unless the limb is unable to hold a wound wet, on account of its smallness, such as the lip, and the gums, and things like these.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a naked member, bare of flesh, such as a finger, or a nose, and the like.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality to be used is this: to be extracted from Blood-sugar which are in sweet waters, pure from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then let them be set aside for the day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and so that nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is to be emptied by bloodletting first, with leech-venom, and then with wound-making.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the limb with nurse-water until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then let them be placed on the wound itself.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	But when they are filled with it and fall, and it is possible to hold the place with wound-making, then it is more dangerous to move; but if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and rubbing, and expressing.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood should be prolonged after the loss of blood-sugar, and it is still residue: then pour a cloth made of linen into cold water, and place it on top, until the residue is cut off.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then sprinkle powder on top of the wound, crushed pease or eggs, and similar things from the astringent: until the blood is cut off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or let them be placed on the place of half-peeled herbs: and let them be left, until the peas adhere to the place, for the blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary that if necessary is the repetition of blood-sugar, when it is possible, change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if they prohibit blood-sugar from suspension, then wipe the place with recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or wrap it now in places, until someone goes out of blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then let them be placed, for they themselves when they feel any blood, immediately adhere.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you want it to fall down, sprinkle on them something of crushed aloe, or salt, or ash: and it falls immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	The Universal Discourse on Restoration, Dislocation, and Cure of Twists, and Similar Conditions.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of a fracture, and the dislocation of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know ye sons, because they will speak of this chapter to the stiff-headed doctors and healers, who have never examined an ancient book, and have not read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it is that this mode of operation is secret among our scientists.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I was not obeis in it at all, and I was not perfected from it unless because of the length of reading ancient books, and study over their understanding, until I extracted the science of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then, because of the adhesions and my study of their length.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	Then, because of the adhesions and my study of their length. And I have already described for you from that in this entire chapter what contains my knowledge: and on what exceeded my experiment, after I shortened it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and shortened it at the end of abbreviation, and showed that end of declination: and I formed in it many forms from forms of instruments which are administered to it, when it is from the addition of declination, as I did in two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In highest rank, and collections out of a fracture of bones, out of those from which the premise is necessary before we begin the rehearsal of broken members, and various, if each one's own.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, that we say in the prolog of this chapter, the sum of speech, and chapters, to which the mind is considered in the first place on the craftsman's station on their value: namely, so that you, and who are eager, know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, then, that when it happens to anyone fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or fall: then you should be first in the proper phlebotomy of him, and solving it, or both at the same time: if not prohibit anything, like weakness of virtue: or is he who happened to something from those boys: or an old decrepitous man: or is the time of a sudden fever, or a sudden cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then, be satisfied with his food, cold herbs, and birds' flesh, and hair: and prohibit wine, and thick meats, and taking off from the plates and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are safe from a sudden fever, and do not trust in the outflow of material to the member: then return the sick to their normal regime first with which he ran his custom.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore the mouth is to be restored which is broken, then it is necessary that the sick man should eat food which is nourished by much food, thick, dark, and with a certain freshness: as food made from wheat mixed with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and entrails of fowls, and fish fresh caught: and wine gross, and such like.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For this regime, however, the healing of the fracture is more rapid and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that bones which are broken, when they are in the third age of man, and decrepitous, it is not possible that they should continue and strengthen themselves always according to their own nature by reason of the drying up of their members: and they strengthen themselves and continue such as come from them at the end of lightness, like the bones of young boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature provides a kind of glue on the broken bone from all sides, with which it holds and ties itself together, until it is joined together piece by piece, and bound together piece by piece, until it has come to the end of strength and firmness, just as it was in the beginning, until it does not prevent its own activities: and for this reason it is necessary that you should place food which is nourished by much food, thick, dark, and with a certain freshness on the sick man's food, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that species of fractures are various, according to the diversity of the members: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head-bone: and a fracture of the breast-bone is different from a fracture of the back-bone: and likewise each member is very different from another in respect of its own nature: and I come with a reminder of all species of fractures set out in their own place, distinct from the other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures differ also within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it is made to break in an arc, besides that they happen in them stars.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when it is broken according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of the stag's leg, that is, stars, and additions coming from it, as there are in the staff, when it is cut with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not coming from: and is fracture with ulnar and dislocation in head: and is fracture small split.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And all species has talent, or own instrument in restauration of it, according to which comes his remembrance, separated in their places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from this, from which is recognized the fracture of the bone, it is its tortuosity, and its eminence: and its appearance to sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When then is not in place the tortuosity appears, and its sound at your touch with contact of the bone with agitation, and does not find great pain: then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there is a tortuosity or small split: so you do not have to move it with hand and compression completely, but put over it from the doctors, of whose came the remembrance, after its moment that suits to place: and then tighten with carefulness.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you know, that when it bends, and splits in two, except that happen to it satagiae, but all its part is moved away from the compare with it: then you have to begin on your time to straighten it, making even it before happens to it a apostema warm.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If then comes to it a apostema warm, then leave it for days, until rests the apostema.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make even it according to any way can you from lenity and talent.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you know, that the restauration of it, and its equating, is easier than the bones, in which happen satagiae.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it, according to which comes to you the remembrance of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If then in the bone are satagiae, then necessary is an extension of this broken member from two parts, if hand sits, or foot: or with your hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And be your position that you put the member on equal place, according to its natural figure, until when extend parts of the broken member: then try, to do them additions with talent, and according to any way can you in their places: and take care according to your strength, not to happen on infirmity through your operation, nor a loss: and take care according to your strength, to apply one two bones with his partner, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	It is necessary at that hour, that you should try and touch him with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore thou seest there anything divers from thee, rectify it, and make it equal to thy own by the measure of thy strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful not to extend it violently, or to compress it strongly, as many do with the foolish.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For oft times they bring about an accident through their own operation, a hot appetite or a contraction in the member: as we have seen from their operations many times before.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind it on after the Gleichung, and a gentle operation, and tighten his member, and rest, and quietness: and warn him of sickness over him.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And let him keep still, that he move not himself in the hour of his weakness, and his sleep by his revolution, and his agitation, and his defecation, and all his motions at the last power of him.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he may keep still, that the position of the member be not a position which follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels in the disposition of the position of the member pain or injury: then it should be, that you turn him to a disposition different from that with which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And beware with him, that his position be that equal, straight: lest there come about in the member torusness, when he is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of a tight member broken is, according to which narrows.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that broken members differ from one another in their width, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which of them are smaller, such as the arm, and the finger, and the foot, and similar to them, then it should be, that there be an inwinding of a soft cloth, thin.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which however of them are coarse, such as the hip, and the leg, it should be, that there be an inwinding in them of a broad, hard cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For a wide ligament connects the member great, and tightens it from every part by an equalstring, so that it does not enter into it a stain.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after you have drained yourself, begin to apply the appropriate liniment to that place, in a soft poultice over the fracture site itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then, begin to wrap the limb with three or four layers of bandage, depending on how much the member is injured, and grasp it lightly with your hand.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then, stretch it with your hand at the upper part from the fracture place, and tighten it less than when you tightened the injured site, as you stretched it.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then, lengthen yourself with the wrap from the fracture place a little, and soften the tightness gradually, until you are free of the injury.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then, take another poultice, and wrap it again over the fractured site with bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then, stretch it with the wrap at the lower part from the fracture place.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation on the tightness of the wrap and its softening, follow as we said in the first upper wrap.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then, place between the wraps a soft cloth or poultice, appropriate for any curvature of the fracture, if there is one: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then, wrap again over it with another poultice.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then, make even on these wraps the spread-out shape that was made uneven right away, if there is no swelling or heat in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is however swelling or a fever in it: then place over it what sits on the swelling, and let it take away the swelling: and let it be left for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then, tighten again over it when the swelling has gone
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be made of half-round bars, smooth and shaped wisely: or of wood where they make grids, which are made of pine, or of gopherwood, that is to say, of palm branches, or of reed: and let the width of each star be, according to this form, and this figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the star which is placed over the injury should be broader and wider a little than the other stars: and the length of the star should be according to what suits the member in its size and proportion.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind closely upon the stars with sutures from another one, according to the first same.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind closely from above with sutures that are off-center, according to what we said about the stricture: and it is so that your stricture should be over the fracture place more: and the more it is distant from the fracture, the less stricture there is.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the sutures are of average thickness and sottishness, and they are of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the sutures are thick, as if they are put on with a blade from an operation of craniotomies by their own threads out of twisted linen, it is a great mistake: for the stricture falls away with them outside the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And sottish sutures again do not agree: for you do not obtain by the stricture that you want to achieve with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be between the star and the star less than a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	That if an invalid is injured through the ends of the stars after the stricture in healthy places: then place under them from soft clay or red wool, until nothing is injured from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with an artery, and there is a break in the skin, I come back to it with recollection in the second chapter with regard to its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the limb is when it is great, it is not necessary that you place on top of it the stars, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the coming of pus.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way of bandaging with which the ancient ones restored themselves, which are placed over a fracture and a dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The way of the common bandage, shortened, for restoring a fracture, suitable for many layers, especially for women and children: because it is from that one above which does not burn, nor does the cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is so that you take from a powdery thing that is ground, and there is a floury thing hanging on the walls of the grindstone by movement of the mill: and you put the confectio (paste) as it is, except that you rub it with albus (egg white): and you do not make the confectio thick, nor sottish.
Deinde utere eo.	Then take it with that hand.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	A different method of dressing wounds, for fractures, dislocations, and twists.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take myrrh, ладан, acacia, olive, and mug-wort; also honey from all sorts of bees, five parts aloe, twenty parts alethus, and a little anise; let them be crushed together with the aloes and let them be mixed with water from alethus, or with calamine lye if the complexion is healthy.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then apply this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and suits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	A different method of plastering, which also serves for fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mug-wort, myrrh, white aloes, five parts of each of the following: ладан, acacia, and armenian bole; twenty parts of alethus; all crushed together and mixed with water, or with calamine lye if the complexion is healthy. Apply it.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method of plastering for joints, and for bones that are separated from their places; it quiets pain in the injury, softens the bone's break, and mends the split bone.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Let it be soaked in a damp wool, and be dipped in vinegar and oil; and let it be placed on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	But this plaster has no power to restore soundness, but it is good for calming hot inflammations; and it drives away pains of its own kind.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A method of plastering that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves from the fig tree and leaves from the wild fig; crush them all together and make a plaster of both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A method of short-term plastering to be applied to the restoration of a broken bone; and when you wish to relieve a hot inflammation that remains.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of aloes, camomile, violoe flower, and herb grain; all crushed together as one part, and mixed with wine if it is a healthy limb that is to be heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is really hot, then confer with it water of coriander or water and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A stronger method of application in resolution, which is this one first, when a seizure occurs of hardness during restoration of the member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe: root of aloes, and linseed, and sarsaparilla, and mealy-seed, and samacu, and flowers of fennel, and chamomile, all of them, a part, well triturated; and confer with water of willow, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All this is according to the temperature of the member, and rest from heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that a fracture be placed on a member during its restoration, unless it has been made from ash and oil: nothing else: and he relates that it should be between грустность and subtilidad.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen on the other hand used to say that they should place on a member during its restoration res in which is dry heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and olive-wax, and things like these from those we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A method of application that is applied to injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe: moth and chick-peece, and hair of man's teeth, or feathers of bird, and aloes, and salt, equal parts: triturate, and screen, and confer: and let it be made from it an plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	But quantity, according to that which is needed, so that there remains a bond, then let it be dissolved, then consider, if pain does not occur, nor itchiness, nor does the broken bone move from its place: then do not resolve it with many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens to him in the place of a harsh itching, or a disturbance of pain, or an swelling: then hasten, and dissolve at the hour itself, and take off the plaster from him: and take you a cloth of wool, or a sponge of sea-wool, wet with water: and dip it in warm water, and wash with it the place, until the itching is calmed, and the pain is soothed away.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place a wool cloth on top of the wound, soaked in vinegar and oil, or oil with rosewater; and bind it over the wound for one night, until he is free from heat and the inflammation of the member has settled, and the pain of his injury has subsided.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat this treatment several times to tighten the wound tightly, and apply a small amount of ointment; and do not tighten it with your own constriction first, and with subtle things, until it has healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the wound has begun to turn red, feel pain, be swollen, and have all its accidents now completely gone, and if you can tolerate the ointment and constriction, then repeat this treatment as you did at first, evenly.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If any of these things do not happen to the member, then do not separate it, unless after three days or four or five or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it has rested for twenty days all this time, according to what you have observed in the healing of the member, so that the fracture appears to be united, and the coagulation of the flesh over it: also add to this treatment more constriction than your first constriction; and add also to the increase of food until it is well fed, according to its previous memory.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture is beginning to dry up and become less than it should: then know that nutrition is forbidden from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	So wrap it up with warm water everywhere you apply it, and let it rest for three days, and give a slight constriction every day.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this treatment therefore nutrition runs to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which the dull healers do by a different means when they do not restore it at first, according to need, and restore it according to its tortuosity, is an error in their treatment, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancient would have written about it in their books, and performed it with that.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see their footsteps at all in that, and it is better that it should not be so.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	¶ On the making of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Head.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are various kinds of fractures and many forms of them; and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture resulting from impact with an instrument, and impact removes the entire bone up to where it reaches the cavity under the bone, which is what happens in the case of an axe in wood, and because of this such a fracture is called axial fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or if an instrument hurts some bone and injures its face but does not pierce the injury all the way to its back, this is called a kalaan fracture, that is, a complete separation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a broken arm, or great, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture there results a crushing or grinding; and its cause is impact with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also penetrating, coming close to the skin, which is under the bone, or is on the face of the bone; and it is a broken arm of these two, or small, or great.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from a fracture there results something hidden in the bone in the subtility of a hair; and it is a small crack, and because of this such a fracture is called a capillary fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from them there results a fracture from falling or hitting with a stone, and similar things, which makes some of their bones come together inside, as happens in the case of an oven when there is a fall or a hit with a stone, and some of its parts are brought together inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	Much more often this occurs in the heads of moist bones, as are the heads of boys.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these species of fractures are separate, and I will come back to them when I remember them all in their place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we shall know all these species of fractures by inspection on them, and by inquiry into them with the help of trials, and by cutting away the corrupted flesh from above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The true capillary is known by this, which is discovered over the bone, and rubbed off and kept down with a caustique: for a black fracture appears.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the cure of fracture, consider first the symptoms of disease: then if you see from the symptoms that it means a manifest meaning above fear, such as fainting with cholera and extension and loss of intellect and cutting off of voice and syncope and acute fever and exit of eyes and redness of them and similar things to these from various conditions, doubtless they do not cure: and if you see non-terrifying symptoms and hope for salvation: then begin the cure of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if a person comes to you injured first with an injury: and it is on the fourth day, then you should try to cure it before the fifteenth day according to all conditions.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then you should remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from a patchwork comes out and those accidents which we have described occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	That is, if the fracture of the bone has already reached the skin touching the brain, and it is with a little, and drawing out: then you should break off a small part, and rub it down, as I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And is, so that you shave the head of the injured person: and discover over the bone as well as you can for you: and according to the shape of the injury, and what is lighter over the sick.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	That is, if you happen to you when discovering the bone of a flow of blood, or of hot swelling: then oppose it with that which is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And is, so that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine, and with oil of rose: and make the joint rest until the swelling subsides, and are safe from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the cure of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is made according to two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The one mode is so, that thou shalt strike the bone with an Incisor and a tight chisel: and this is the form of it.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	From hence take another Incisor, somewhat broader than the first; and this is the form of it.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also take another Incisor, broader still; and this is the form of it.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second mode is, that thou shalt have with thee a number of different chisels: some of which shall be broader and some narrower; and these last shall be at the extremities of their edges, and shall be made of iron or steel: and use thou ease in striking on the Incisor, so as not to hurt thyself, but yet with a firm touch.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone be strong and hard: then thou shouldest cut around it with chisels which do not cut deeply: for they are called so, because they do not pass into the flesh at all after the bone: wherefore, because the tip of the chisel is round on that side which is under the sharp head, and like a circle, and a little dent prevents it from sinking in, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting that thou takest many of these chisels, and each one of them should be suited to the thickness of the bone; until thou hast a Terebra present for all the length of the cranium: the tip of whose sharpness in length and brevity is suited to the thickness of the bone.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three kinds of chisels or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	And the quality of piercing around the bone which is broken, is this: that thou settest the chisel on the bone, and turnest it with thy fingers, until thou knowest the bone to be pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then also change the chisel to another place, and put that which is between all the holes of a size suited to the radius, or about it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incision what is between all the holes from bone: and make it thinner than you can above it from the edge of lightness, as we said, until you remove the bone, or by your hand, or with some other instrument that you prepared for it: like tenals and subtile forpices.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it shall be that, so that you take all caution, so that it does not touch Terbum, or any of the incisions from the siphac.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have thus circled the bone and separated it from the siphac, if it is continuous with that, and you extract it, it shall be that you rasps, and equal the end of it which remains in the bone with another similar incision tool.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it shall be that it is thin and subtle rather than other incisions.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	That if there remains some little bone, and it is hard: then take them with ease, with the one that is near you from the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound afterwards with the liniments, and the ointment which we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another way of the operation is easy, far from fear: which says Galen, and praised it greatly: and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary that you first, so that you begin to hold the part of the bone where the fracture is worse, and more apparent: until when you have held it, and put under it the end of this lens-shaped incision, whose this form is.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens part, it does not cut anything: and the acute part of it in its two sides running in length, as you see: so that the lens part is placed on the siphac, facing the acute part of it in the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then beat over the incision from one part with a small mallet, until you cut all the bone with ease, as it is turned out: and you are safe from the panic, that which does not happen in it an accident, which you really fear.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if a medic should not be more foolish and more ignorant than human beings, and should not be sleeping, then if there remained something attached to the bones from the pannicle in some places, he would strike it with the edge of his lenticular scalpel and release it from him with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is released from him without injury, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	For if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the pannicle, and the flesh that is severed from the bone is a part of it, and there remain in him roughness and subtle wounds: then you should scrape away this roughness, and cut out these wounds with fine razors which you have prepared. So that it may be possible for you to administer them in any place more convenient for them, and more correct in their form, according to what the operation leads you to do, and the broken bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And you should administer it with the same razors, first of all, at the root of the tooth.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the smaller one after.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do this according to continuity, until you reach the part where it is narrow, and all of them are fine and smaller.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each and every one of the small cracks between the teeth, and in the subtle fracture, you should administer care, according to what leads you to straighten it.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing that does not hide itself from all, and to which there is any study in this art, and it stands on what we have written, and shown with regard to the big fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the pannicle has been detected and is holding onto it when you cut the bone: then you should take linen cloth, according to the amount of wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it on the hole of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth of linen, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first pannicle: and do this as easily as you can over it, so that it does not groan.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply the ointment above the ligament; and do not bind it, unless only for the quantity that holds the fracture in place: and let go of it with this cure one day, or two days, until you are secure from the heat of inflammation.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then soak it, and apply after that the medicines with which it is superfluous to be dry: such as the roots of the lily, and the flour of the herb, and the powder of the turpentine, and the aristolochia, and similar things: and this is how you should make a powder out of these medicines, which powdery substance you apply over the fracture like those that are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply in it all the medicine of its own property, which is to cleanse, and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And cause it, according to your ability, that the fracture in your cure be clear: and may it not be in it the grease of an ointment, nor a dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not leave the virus aggregating in it at all: for when the virus aggregates over the scalp patch, it corrupts it, and rots it, and causes a great evil afterwards: and this has already happened to the syphons of the head, when it is cleaned out by it, especially when the cure of it is neglected, blackening on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider then, if these accidents happen to the sick which we have said, you will know that it is certainly deadly.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the blackening does not happen, unless from the medicine which is put on it, and is in the power of its medicine, that it makes it blackening: then you should take out of honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and with them a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put the patch over the syphon: then care for the patch with the species of cure which are convenient, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	De restoratione nasi when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Head IIII.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You should know that they do not break from the nose unless both parts of it break at the same time, or one of them: for there are two bones in it: because the lower part is cartilaginous, and does not break, and does not happen to it except by weariness, and twists, and cracks.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the parts breaks, then you should put your small finger in the nostril hole and break it with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this artfully with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And be careful so that you don't cause pain to him by your surgery.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	That if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that finger: then it should be adjusted by the end of the radius where the small thickness is located.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If on the other hand the fracture is in two parts, then you should make it similar to this one and properly repair it on the first day of the fracture if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days from the time when they are calm, let them apply heat.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then put a piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part: or put two pieces if the fracture is in two parts: and let it be of such a quantity that it fills the nostril hole.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient restorers said that they pour linen cloth into butter and change it every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That is not what I think; however, it should be poured into chalk that has been ground with a mortar and dusted with flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the linen cloth until the nose is dry, and let the cartilage harden.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes when linen cloth is inserted into the nose with a quill from a goose, after it has been laid on top of it: and so it will hold the fracture of the nose more firmly, and prevent the sick person from stopping breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want to, do it like this: and if you don't want to, make the linen cloth.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	That if the nose hurts again while you are working, apply a green plaster to the nose, or one soaked in rose oil, or a little dacquaint.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if the apostema is not hot, then it is necessary that one should make a paste of the same with Sisam flour and powdery pus mixed with albumen.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put over the wound a poultice of straw, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the bones of the nose are fractured or broken, then it is necessary that one should split them open and extract the bones with the instruments suitable for this purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then cut off the skin, and take care of the flesh that is ingrained in it and consolidated with the plasters suitable for it, or with ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	But if a rib is lodged between the nose, then it is necessary that one should heal the wound with liniments: and administer a tube of lead, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	For the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and not joined to the cheek bone: examine then if the fracture is only of the jaw and does not break into two pieces, and heal it to the inside: then the knowledge of it is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, insert the index finger of your left hand into the mouth: likewise, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push it out with ease toward the outside with your other hand from the inside part of the bone, and thus adjust it evenly.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	But if the jaw fracture has already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary that you should administer external force to both parts, in accordance with rectitude: until the adjustment of it is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	But if the dislocation or rupture has already occurred in the teeth, then tighten them with a twine of gold, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put over the fractured jaw a poultice.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over the wound a doubled cloth, and put over it a large piece of skin, cut to the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind the wound well, according to how you have prepared your ligature, and let its application remain until it is destroyed: and instruct the sick person to use peace and quiet: and put his food, that he may not choke.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you think that the wound has changed at all in any way: then approach and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then make straight what has been altered from it, and cover the wound with a plaster made of pounded mortar mixed with alum or with meal ground to fine powder, after you have removed any pus: and put on top of the plaster a layer of thick woolen cloth.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached to the wound and its position of the bones does not change, let go of it, do not tighten it, until it heals: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often bound for seven days.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, while it is being bound, a hot swelling occurs: then administer to him what I said often in the treatment of it, until it goes away.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	I have seen a small fragment separate from the bone, or from a splint: then be careful in this, so that you do not remove those splints from the instruments when they are due to be removed.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the opening of the wound is tight, then enlarge it with a phlebotomist according to the amount of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you remove those splints, and none remain, then close up that opening of the wound if it is wide: and if not, put over the wound with a plaster which suits it, and let it form flesh, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	As for the restoration of the fork, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The fork is often broken at the front part from the part of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is broken and separated into two, except that they come to be in a splint: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Thus, what happens to the bones of satagiae: and it is more difficult to restore them.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or, what is a fracture with an ulnar bone.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation when the fracture is without an ulnar bone, is, that you make these two ministers hold one to support what follows the broken fork, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make your fingers equal in length, until their form is as it should be: and let there be no prominence or depression in them.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need to extend further, then it is necessary that you place under a tickle ball made of cloth or wool: and let the size of it be according to the amount of your need: and extend, and bend forward the fork, and hold the ball in your hand, until the length of the fracture is equal, as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you are unable to bring the end of the fork to the outside: since it reaches to the depths: then it is necessary that he lies down on his shoulder: and place under his middle shoulder in size, and press the minister of his shoulder towards the lower part, until he raises up the bone of the fork which is in the depth to the top: and then correct the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel a pulsation from the fork, and it quivers: then it is necessary that you find out about it, and with ease take out the pulley.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is held back in the bone, then use your incisorium which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the fork an instrument to hold the sinew fast: and that instrument is made of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is formed like an ear which is not closed up.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width is according to that by which you need it from the size of the bone, and its proportion.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length, however, also should be according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	It shall have two ends, like eyes; and one end shall be broad, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	But if you see a wound that you have cut when you extracted the nail of the bone, it is broad, and secure from the hot apoplexy; then join the two skin flaps with a stitch.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the break is small, or the apoplexy is warm: then fill the nail with pads, and powder according to the quantity of the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	What if hot apoplexy occurs? Then pour oil roaded, and vinegar, and wine on it, and put it on.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	But a bone fracture when there is no nail, and no cut, is, as you put it on the bone, a plaster made from ground flour with chalk.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put a timber prop on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a ball under its tilting, if you can bear that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the blood, that is, the blood of a horse which the Saracens hold, which is long and thick: and make its width be that of the palm of a hand, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a double layer of cloth over the timber prop and the plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an astrillum from a thin table, whose width is three fingers wide, and similar in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth and astrillum together at the place of magic which falls on the fracture and place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the magic above the fracture like a roll, and wrap it above its neck, and below its chin, healthy and sick: and reduce it on every side, and you shall see that the bone is held in place by the compression: and this is, so that it does not lie over you, and all, so that it does not move the timber from the top of the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this, it must be, that you look at the sick every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whatever time the ligaments become soft, and you see the timber is beginning to move: then straighten it out, and tighten the ligaments.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put a sedative on his back, and under the tickle of his armpit near his sleep, at night, that with him aid comes from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	So let the fracture of the fork be healed by elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandages unless an accident happens from itching or from a splint, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then put on a new plaster, if you see his face toward that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the strictness, and let him go, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the fork is tightened and strengthened according to many in twenty days: and sometimes it is done in some people with less.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	De restoration
Caput VII.	The Restoration of the Fork.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the fork break, and at the wide end of it: and it is not broken from its end.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	So when it breaks from that place, and it breaks in the middle of it, and it is not known except by touch: then according to what figure the fracture has, prepare the treatment for it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it on its natural figure with all the skill of your ability.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on top of the place powdered with calamine and a wooden spoon, and put on a towel from above.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on top of him a flat board from a thin table according to the quantity of the fork of all, or wider it is a little.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If, however, under the board is crushed in any place of the fork, then make it even with the wooden spoon until the board descents according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then rub on top with a long and careful motion, until the board does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the bandage is softened, tighten it and make the board even if it moves from its place: and let him lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And indeed the spatula was restored after twenty days, or after thirty days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is completed, then loose the ligature: and you shall be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For this itself is out of the bones, whose communion is not feared, and their loosing also.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if it proceed from a bone-end, and pierces under the skin: then cut off above it, and take it away.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what I said in the fracture of the fork from sitting on a hot poultice, if anything happen therefrom.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	[Regarding] the restoration [of the fracture] of the breastbone.
Caput VIII.	[Chapter] VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone is sometimes broken in the middle of it, and that seldom happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	But the ends thereof are often broken, and are crushed from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it is broken in the middle, which inclines to the lower parts, and happens to it a heavy pain, and difficulty in breathing, and possibly spitting of blood, and does not conceal the fracture, its restoration is that it should lie on its back: and put between its blades a sponge.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press its shoulders, and bring together the ribs on both sides or on the sides with the hands: and gently adjust in alignment, according to any possible way that it fits, until the shape of the bones is restored, according to which it should suit.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put over it a poultice and a pad, and put above it an arch from a thin board of willow or holly, and from such like in lightness, after you have washed it with water.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then gently adjust in binding it over the broken bone, so that it does not move: and pass with the binding roundly to the back some times, and tighten it tightly as it goes down.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding at every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it: and if necessity of it incites to its solution by itching, or any corrosion that happens in the place, or pain, or a swelling: then approach it, and loosen it, and remove the poultice, and adjust what has happened in the way of curing it.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then apply the plaster, if you see that it fits the face; and fasten it firmly until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	When broken, to restore the ribs.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the places near the back and from the extremities of them to the front.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not suffer from wear and tear except for this reason, because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And his knowledge does not conceal itself from the sense in inquiry when the fingers touch.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration is made so that an even fracture with the fingers in a possible second way, until it has recovered its shape, as it should be required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply the plaster, and tighten the broken bone with a splint if he does not like that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is hidden towards the inside: then a very painful pain occurs, and stabbing, such as that which happens to him who has pleurisy: for the bone pricks the organ, and also a difficult breath, and coughing, and blood spitting occur: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancient have devised many means in this regard: and among them are those who say, Let there be placed food which generates inflammation and ventosity, that it may inflame the wind, and stretch out, and push the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we detest, so that it does not happen quickly to make a warm poultice, unless it is necessary.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then add this to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: Let him be placed in a windy place, and then cover him with a blanket of strength, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, we fear that the wind will draw off excesses to the place, because of the weakness of the disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: It is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been immersed in hot oil: and let there be placed feathers between the ribs, so that it is filled: so that it is a tie of equality when it is turned round by its roundedness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick one should be fed and given medicine to ease the pleurisy.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the patient is ill and cannot tolerate it, and if the wound hurts when it is probed and we are afraid of the sick person: then we should split the skin from the bone, as long as the rib is broken.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should put an instrument over it that keeps the siffar in place, for which there is a precedent: and we should easily open the jaw, and then cut into it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we should gather the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a stitch: and we should dress him with plasters until he heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If during this time there is a hot swelling, then let it be cleaned, and pour oil with rose water on it, and put it over the place: and the sick one should be fed with what is suitable for the swelling.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	During this time, he should also lie on his side, where he sleeps, until he heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	For the restoration of a broken spine in the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	However, when a bone of the neck is fractured, and this rarely happens to it, and also to the spine of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	So when such a thing has happened to someone, and you want to know if it has healed or not: then trust in God.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stupefied, and dead: and cannot be moved or stretched or squeezed, and when you pinch them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then you should know that he is not healed, and he is mortal in many respects.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he can move them and feels the pinching with fingers and the prick with a needle: then you should know that the bones of his neck are healed, and that the sick one will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If his spine in the back is similar to that, and you want to know if it has healed as well, or not: then look at his feet: if you see that they are softened, and the same happens to them as happened to his hands: then when he lies on his back, he moves about and sits without wanting to: but when he bends forward over his belly, he does so with a will: and when he bends backward over his back, he wants to drink, but cannot: then you should know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	And so I do not neglect his work in the cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if nothing of that happens to him, then it is a lighter matter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure of him that happens from that is, as you seek to calm the inflammation with hot oil: so that you put on top of the broken skin only rosin oil: or when you wash off sweat.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place over that sometimes a little in the day, until it is calmed down by the inflammation: and then place over the spot one of the comforting plasters, drying up, and tightly tied over it with a ligament: and order the sick person to use rest and peace.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on that side where he feels pain, until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	That if something happens to the separation of a bone, or anything that has already separated from it: then you should let it rest on the skin, and take away it off.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bind together with two pieces of flesh, if it is large, with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the person with some ointment, from a balm, until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	But if finally a bone is broken and the end of it is cut off: then you should put the thumb of the left hand into the joint, and with the right hand, as well as possible, and the second by equalization.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place over it, and take it off: and care for the wound with the cure that preceded it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Of restoring Achaeans.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do the bones of the Achaeans break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they break, then their fracture is not, unless it is separated at the ends of them: and they split down the middle, and decline towards the insides: and it happens to the person that there is pain in the spot, and a bruise: and it makes the leg that it breaks.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is, as you stretch your hand over it, until you are standing over the fracture, which is like a figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If it is a fracture at the ends only, then make that fracture equal, according to how you are prepared from equality, until it resembles its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is along its length or has already turned inward towards the inside: then let the sick person lie on his/her stomach until you are ready to restore that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made that equal, place an emplastrum on it: then place a wooden or leather splint on top of it, and tighten the tightening more than you fear the displacement of the fracture, and do not remove the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And when that equalization has been made with him so that it is filled, until he gets it by the tightening according to the equality: and order the sick person, so that he sleeps on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if that hot swelling has occurred to him: then discontinue the extension of it, and its restoration until it subsides: and place on top of it what he sits, according to how it preceded, then return to its restoration: and tighten him as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if it has happened in the bone, or it has broken, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Restoration of a fracture: Assistant.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The assistant is that which is between the chin to the head of the spoon.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is broken, then its restoration is according to two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	Of which one is: that you take a flat piece of wood of middle thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bind two ligaments at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it hang from a elevated place: and let the sick person sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let him put his broken arm on the wood, until it reaches its tip, in which middle there is attached a little piece of wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang it from above the person with something heavy, so that he extends his hand down towards the ground.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician shall set the fracture of his own hands at once, until the fracture is healed, as it ought to be.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that he should lie down on his own chest: and he shall hang his hand from his neck with a sling.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two servants, that they should hold on either side of his hand that is above the fracture: and that each one of them should hold down the other, and each one of them should stretch out his hand to his side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish that the extension be stronger, then bind under the fracture with a bandage, and over it with another bandage: and each one of the two servants shall stretch out his hand to his side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If then the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it is necessary that there should be placed one bandage under the elbow joint, and another under the fracture towards the hip.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And in the same way, if the fracture is near the hip: then it is necessary that there should be placed a bandage on that spot, and above the hip itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then set the fracture with ease without working, until it is levelled as it ought to be, and applied with a good application: then bind it, if there does not occur a swelling that is hot.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if a swelling that is hot does occur, then release the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put on the body a woolen cloth dipped in vinegar and olive oil until it is calm the swelling: then bind it: and the way of binding it is, that you should place an ointment over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put on a new solution from a cloth above the ointment.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he shall set his arm on his aid, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put on a cloth, and bind over the aid arm, so that the arm stands in its place by means of the stars: if he does not forbid you from doing this, or anything else, or does not change your mind about it, do not do it to him from any broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If it is time, and something changes within you from a broken bone, then use the stars: and it is, that you place over the fracture the star which is wider and stronger than the rest of the stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between all the stars the width of a finger: and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten over the stars the tightness which I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And let your tightness be over the place of the fracture tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as much as the fracture lengthens, let the tightness be smaller.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If then you see the setting of the stars and the tightness, as we have said, in the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do it: and if it is time for a poultice of heat, then leave the tightness and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligaments in all three days, that no itchiness may occur in the place, or swelling, or hinderance of food reaching the limb, because of the fluidity of tightness.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct then that whole thing, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If however you are on trust, so that nothing may come from it: then do not loosen the ligaments, unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let him lie on his back on his pillow, and his hands on his belly: and let you place under the bed a full woolen sheet equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day, that the figure of the broken member may not be loosened, nor the ligaments softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct then that whole thing by your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place for the nurse food according to the order which we have set forth, so that there is a slight food at first, until it begins to tighten his jaw: then let there be increased for him the food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the custom of aid and of the limb is, that it be tightened in forty days: then therefore let it be loosened, and administered a bath, and be treated with an ointment which corrects it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is bad and bruised, then do not separate from it the ligaments and stars until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	De restoratione fracturait brachiae:
Caput XIII.	[III] If the fracture is of the upper arm:
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The forearm is composed of two bones which are called two phalanges.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is placed under the little finger on the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Maybe therefore breaks only one phalange, or the other, or maybe both at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore a phalange is broken which is small and upper, then the restoration of it is easy, and the healing of it is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when a phalange is broken which is lower, this is a bad fracture, and the healing of it is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse is it when both bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	Now if the bone which is broken is a small phalange upper, then it is fitting for the physician to come to its restoration, in order that he may place an extension which is small with ease, until it is equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the phalange which is broken is large: then it is necessary, so that he may place a strong one which is tight.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary, so that he places the shape of the hand at its restoration, and an extension beyond the knuckle on the little finger.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be placed higher on all the fingers: and let the flexor be placed on all the fingers, or other: and let it be sitting square on itself, and let the little finger face it, or in its direction, in height, so that it does not incur pain.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then he should extend the arm from the lower part, or with his own hand, or with a ligature.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another minister should extend from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should set the bone, until he reduces it according to the best shape that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are fractures of the bones, then consider reducing all the fragments to their places with your power.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If there is indeed a separate satthaiatum [a type of fracture] and you prick the skin and do not expect to restore it: then find over it, and remove it according to the manner that we have said in those that precede this one.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already done for that singular chapter, so take the cure of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If it happens in the beginning of your cure [of the wound] that the apostema is hot, then take a thin cloth made of linen with a blue dye, and white wax, and place between its thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth tightly over it, until when the apostema sits down: then remove the waxy [ cloth], and put a prepared plaster made from ground flour with albumen.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on plasters, and let the plaster that is placed on the fracture be slightly wider, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And you should know that the number of plasters of the arm is six in many dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one  [bone] or two  [bones] simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on your binding tighter and more robust over the site of the fracture, and somewhat more with the binding towards the upper part of the fracture, or towards the lower part: or put on a softer binding over it according to what preceded it at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture be soft, damp cloths: and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread that is tied with linen itself, between thinness and thickness, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	Consider the limb and its ligaments after a few days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens that requires correction, such as a itch that occurs in the limb: then it should be, let the member soak in hot water, until that itch subsides, and remove the member without constricting, until it subsides, and then repeat the binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the stricture has already been softened, and the bone has already been removed, and similar things: then rectify all of it with your power, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb by an excess of stricture, then it is necessary that you make it a little softer and leave it for several days, until it heals up, and then tighten it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if any of these things do not happen to the sick person that I have said, then it is not necessary that he should be made well, except after twenty days or about that number.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then hang up his hand so as to support his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be kept even, and guarded from violent movements with your power.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him lie on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And you should know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this depends on the condition of the flesh, and the power that you have.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XXII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	You should know that it is rare for a fracture to occur in the palm of the hand or in the knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him unless he has a great deal of grinding.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture occurs, or grinding: then it is necessary that the sick person should lie on his back: and before him they should set up a second seat, equal to the first.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand on top of it.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	And then make the bones that are broken to meet, and equal them with the power of the doctor, until they are joined together by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he should put on a plaster and a splint, if a swelling does not occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then put the splint from above, according to the amount of space: and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is lower down round about the wrist of the hand, then make a sphere-like shape out of cloth: and order the sick person to wrap his hand with it so as to support it with his own hand that is broken: and then tighten it with the long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And put it on a branch of cork, where it is soft, so that it can be applied to the plant's body; and bind it, according to what is needed.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is on the outside, then it should be like this: you should put one branch above and another below the plant; and hold your hand flat.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place the splint as if it were a strap: and extend it between the fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	That if a fracture should occur to any of the fingers' joints, then if it is the thumb, it should be made equal in length as needed.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it to the plant: and if you wish, put a straight branch on either side of the fracture so that it does not move and does not bend.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in any of the other fingers, like the middle, or the index, or the ring, or little finger, then it should be made equal and tied to the finger that comes after it: or all of them should be tied together according to their length, and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a branch on top of it as we have said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that arrangement, wait with heat: and oppose it to what is needed when something happens to it, according to its story.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Restoration of a Hip Fracture:
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone often breaks and is felt: because it turns inward and backward.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And the restoration of it is such that one ties a ligature above the fracture, and another below it.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the injured person extends their arm outward on their side.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he should extend all the ligaments according to their equality: and this is how it should be done when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near the root of the hip bone, then there should be a ligature on one side toward the pelvis so that it does not extend upward; and another below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And so likewise if there is a fracture near the knee, then put a bandage around the nearby ligament, so that it extends down to the lower part.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then let the doctor make both of his hands equal in length, until he reduces it according to the natural figure: and let the bones be joined together with a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it should be put on plaster and tightened if there is no swelling of the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	What if there is swelling in it: then let him rest for a few days, until the swelling becomes warm, and then return to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	But the bandage should be such.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap a piece of cloth tightly over the fracture, that is, a bandage: and double it twice, or three times: and let there remain from it an excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until it has reached the root of the foot.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg close to the knee towards the lower part, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper side of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap the leg and thigh, what remains of the cloth.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put on the thigh in the place of the fracture as many stars as are necessary: and let there be one star placed over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill with plasters between the leg and the thigh, soft ones, so that the bandage is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with the strong bandage from the middle of the place of the fracture, three turns, or four.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the longer the ligament extends from the place of the fracture, the smaller and softer should be your bandage, and the softer it is.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then bring to the ends of the thread, which you have inserted between the thigh and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind then with the three stars that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then bring to the lower ends of the thread, until you have reached the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tie also the ends of the stars from the other side: so that the bandage does not move away from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then let go of the ligature on this, while it remains, so that corruption does not occur to the member, nor aposteme, nor swelling, and such like to them.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	That if anything should happen from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then with the solution of that, and rectify what has happened there all together, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if a fragment of bone pokes you: then it should be fixed by you, if it is possible to do so.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find on top of it, and move that one: and take care with it who remembers it before, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is tight, except that stars are added to it, as we have said in the thigh and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in restoring it, so that the fracture does not cause a limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored by itself, except that the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he who has it should always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is tight after fifty days, or that a little is added to it, or a little is relaxed: all of this is according to the difference of coloration, and the rest of dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the rotula of the knee.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that the fracture of the rotula of the knee rarely happens, but it often happens to him.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	But if it has happened to him a fracture, then there is only one thing: either a crack, or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is with injury, and without injury.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And stand on top of it all with a sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is such that it equitates what has been disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it gathers together, and joins according to what is possible from the correction and ease, and manufacture.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put a plaster of rice flour, or of flour, mixed with egg white: and put on top of it an oval star, if you can bear it: and tighten tightly with a fitting bandage to it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions which we have mentioned in the rest of the breaks: such as ecstasmes of heat and similar things to them: so that you oppose every accident with what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	§ On restoring a broken leg.
Caput XVII.	Ch. XX.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that there are two bones of the leg, one is thick and called by the name of the leg; and the other is fine, and called by the name of the femur.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both bones of the leg, in the same species of fracture which happens to the two bones of the arm; and because of this, its restoration is done as with the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	Which if both bones break at the same time, the leg becomes dislocated in all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the fine bone breaks, the leg is dislocated towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thick bone breaks, it dislocates downward; and of these two which do not conceal themselves from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equality, and binding of the astrags according to that as equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a bad fracture, it has many complications: so that it is necessary to make an extension less and with milder alleviation for you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg itself there is an operation somewhat like that of the arm; and it is, as when you equalize the astrags and complete all your operation, then take two strips from pine wood, which is used in making shoulder joints which are placed under tablets: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose from them those which have a small thickness, and there should not be any of the minute ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap it up with two pieces of cloth, according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And put one side of the leg from one side, and the other from the other: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two fasci [i.e., strips of tissue] in three places from the two extremities and middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	Since constriction is prevented, the incision turns toward the right and left, and remains in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And already a hook is placed from wood according to the length of the crurus [i.e., limb], and placed therein so that it preserve itself from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And much more should you do, so that you make it [i.e., the fracture] when it is a proper ulna.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then examine the crus every day, and with great care examine it at the end of apoplexy, or inflammation, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If then anything happens from among these  [i.e., the injuries], then oppose it with what is necessary until it is healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel bone does not have an innermost fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	But of the bones of the foot there is sometimes a fracture, and of the fingers it also happens that there is a fracture; but it does not happen to them except through wear and tear in many places.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	Which if there is a fracture of the bones of the foot and you see those bones sliding one over another, then put the injured foot on the ground prepared to walk.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and place your foot on that which raises itself from among those bones; then press it or trample it, and make it equal, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put a plaster on it, and a bandage from above; and place under the foot a flat board which has two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten it with a constricting band around the foot while you are walking it with cloth, and with the rest of what it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	But when three or four days have passed, then solve the ligaments.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find bones that are equal, or if there are fractures, they are displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Operation therefore is in them, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if any of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them equal to each other according to what I told you in the restoration of finger of hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put your finger on the nail according to the length of the finger, and make it as wide as that; then place under the foot this plate which I told you, and tighten it by a tight strap.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what is broken is of bones two, or three, or more, then put on all fingers their own plates, wrapped in a linen cloth; and tighten the plate in the lower foot: and let it stand on one tip of the table outside the navel of the foot so that it holds fast by good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is for you that you do not forget, but consider all that I have told you about the other broken by the accidents which we spoke of: and oppose every accident with him that it should.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	As for the fracture of the woman's vulva, and of the bones of the chest, and of the man's genitals.
Caput XIX.	The head of chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the woman' vulva is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her back on the side of her spine about the same way, and hold her.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then fill the woman' vulva with cotton until she is filled: and let it be in the vulva of her like a ball.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then shake the woman, and dry her back slowly.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton comes out before the door of the vulva like a ball, and the broken mouth returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a little wool on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	But when she wants to urinate, let the cotton move with ease, and then urinate; and reduce it according to the way that you put it in first: and then bring back to her wool first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let it do this for seven days, or so, because the mouth is restored itself.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you see a wound, take a wisp of straw and bind it to the opening with thread, and push the whole wisp into his vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force, until the wound is pushed inside the vulva, for it returns broken.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with poultice, and let it stand for a few days, as we have related, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the pelvis of a man or woman breaks, then administer to its restoration, and that which we have related concerning the pelvis of anchae.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And let not the rectum be hidden in those who are close to breaking, for they are few, especially if there is a certain study or usage.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book very well, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many dispositions how your rectum should be straightened in its restoration and narrowing: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the pelvis of a man breaks, take the throat of a goose; and push the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place on top of it a turning-over cloth, and turn it over; and let it stand for three days or so, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Of the restoration of broken bones, when it is with an arrow.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX:
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is appropriate to him who has the fracture with an arrow, especially if it is large, such as the pelvis bone, or auxiliary ones, or similar to it; as you see fit, and let the blood flow out: if you witness the conditions of bleeding, such as mentioned above.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the arrow spits blood, then you should, as you see fit, cut off its limb, so that it becomes powder on top of the wound: if there is no other available for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in the same day: and do not put off that which must be done, unless there is a swelling.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a swelling of heat happens, then dismiss its restoration until the ninth day, until it subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause him to suffer bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if the fracture of the jaw is above the detected wound: then you should consider reducing it and making it even with your hands easily and with a small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if the extension of it is not prepared, and its equating with your hands: then reduce him with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And this is an instrument made of iron, the length of which is the quantity of seven or eight fingers; and its breadth is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four according to the quantity that he needs for the cure of any kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a little roughness on it, so that it does not double itself at the compression on the top in the hour of operation: and let there be an acute extremitas, which has a margin in its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above its thickness from its median to its inferior.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, let the acute extremity be curved over the extremity of the prominent bone: and push it with a one-way force until, when the jaw returns, it is equated with a certain equating.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore consider equating the extremities of the fracture opposite to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	That if the extremities of it are fragile, and does not take it well with the instrument: then you should consider, that you strike the extremity of its bone, until the instrument can get a hold of it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you cannot reduce them at all with what we have said before, then strike him with it that belongs to him from the incisorises that we have mentioned: or clamp him with a one-way clamp in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then rub off what remains on the bone from the roughness and small cortex.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the jaw is reduced, and finds itself after the reduction a painful and annoying ache: then you should know that the jaw has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	I shall now proceed to explain that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For this reason you give a great help to the sick person when your own recovery is completed by mending the bones.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip the cloth in a black vinager.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a poultice of burnt eggshells or any other oil on it: so that it does not happen to him putrefaction and decay.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then give the medicine at the hour of your own recovery from bone mending.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And remove the splint: so that you do not fall by the weight of the splint when you cut open the second hole according to the amount of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take all precautions so that you do not tighten the broken bone.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For often this has been done by dull doctors and has resulted in illness or death for their patients or decay or swelling, that is, putrefaction.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And make your own fracture soft, gentle, and different from the tightness of broken fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	For if the bone is bad or large and you place a splint on it which gives rise to a bad accident that we have described, and suspends pain in the place: then you should not place a splint on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make the wound closures at the site of the splints, and tighten the bone with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When it is a day old or two days old and you see the bone beginning to putrefy so that pus is being generated in it: then remove the cloth which you placed on top of the bone with vinager.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then give a laxative and ointments which we usually use for medication of wounds, such as the four- herb ointment and others like it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And so you may loosen the ligaments.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the bone every day from morning to evening until it is healed and cured.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it should be prepared so that pus can flow out of it easily to the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days have passed by since the wound and it has not healed, nor has the scar tissue formed: then know that there are little bones in that place.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why you should inquire about a break when it is testing.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those little bones are separated, remove them, and pull out themselves.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of those little bones are not separated, and prick the limb, and cause pain, avert that pain, and remove it in any way possible for you that injury.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens to a wound to ache, or to swell, that is, is infected, or any other kind of corruption and putrefaction: then you should oppose each of them with what is suitable for him in the cure, whose prececessory narrative is in his chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that in which it is necessary that my speech should remain standing, and which you make present thought to when a bone breaks, and comes out on a limb, such as the hip bone, and auxiliaries, and similar to them from large limbs, i.e., so that you do not suppose attraction of it, for often happens death from that injury, and moreover remove it, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps, indeed, it may fall away by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, therefore, cure the break, if you have it: and otherwise, remove it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Of the Cure of a Nodule in a Wound in the Leg.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This Nodule often occurs in a wound in the leg.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Particularly, that which is near joints: and it grows out of that limb's shape.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps does not allow the limb to move in its natural manner.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider therefore then, if the Nodule is new: administer to it medicines that have a tightening effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and lead-ore, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, that you take some of these things, or all of them: and apply them with astringent wine, or white of egg, or vinegar; and place them on the Nodule in a box, and bind them tightly to it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And loose the bandage, and don't remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then remove it, and put on another one, until the swelling goes down.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tighten with a lead strip laid crosswise over it.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead is indeed the property of removing anything feared from the body.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already sunk into the stone, and is tight, and necessity urgently calls for its removal: then find on top of it a little bit, and cut off the excess: or cut it off with some knives, until it comes off: and take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Regarding the cure: when it is restored, and the limb remains stiff after that, not in accordance with its natural state.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of a bone is restored, and the limb remains stiff after that, it is not for any other reason but many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one cause is, a multitude of ligatures and ties not according to what is proper: or on account of the excess of ointment applied at the wrong time: or because of a lack of blood in the body, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its cure is, to feed the sick, and make its body strong, until the blood increases in it.
Et administra balneum.	And give it a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put a blade on the limb: to attract the blade toward it, so that it draws in much food.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And give him frequent ointments with warm water, until the nourishment runs, and returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Regarding the cure of fractured bones when they heal crookedly:
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a limb, which has been restored to its natural form after its fracture and swelling, is yet crooked, or stiff: and if it is fed by the shape of the limb, not, however, preventing it from performing its proper function: then you should not accept its excuse, that it will break again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there were also many dull doctors and healers who made that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed terrible and brings about death or great fear, as if it were deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the swelling and trembling have just begun: then it should be steeped in warm water, in which herbs that soften have been decoked, such as the leaves of aloe, and its root, and melilotus, and others like them.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let there be made for it a poultice with a soft poultice, like one made from dandelion roots ground up.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let mucilage be made from the root of aloe and mixed with chicken fat or oil of sesamum: and let it be applied with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let pine trees be taken and ground up with columbine grass and other like remedies that are called by name for reducing the consolidations.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the trembling has abated with persistent stroking, an ancient and gentle rubbing that is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let the movement of the members be administered to all parts at all times.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the twistedness has already preceded and is strong and has become fixed to a stone, and the need for its treatment with iron has arisen: then it should be cut above where the bone comes out, and that which comes from the twisting or bone with small nicks should be removed: and ease should be given to it with tenderness and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the Speech on Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Head 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of certain joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why does it restrain itself from its own motion, and is it fixed in position, and does it support the figure of the member.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And does it give rise to painful disorders and injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	But when such a dislocation has occurred, then one should hurry to restore it: and should not delay doing so at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place will become stiff, and perhaps with it there will be a reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not necessary that he should shudder, nor be extended at the time of his examination.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For he often makes the spasms happen, and causes pain.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then you should come to the wound with a needle.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then he should be left alone until the swelling subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is to be massaged with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it is to be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every member is to be treated with its memory in place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already ordered the chapters on dislocations, also according to what came before in the fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	§ On the care of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	A little dislocated are both jaws unless it is rare.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the jaw is made according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are removed from their places with a small movement, and become slightly softer.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated with an intact and complete dislocation, until they become softer towards the breast, until the salivia runs away with the wound, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and it slips away from his tongue with the word.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however its dislocation is small, then it returns to several positions by itself with a little.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete and intact: then it should be administered a reduction quickly, and not tarry: and it is, as if he holds the head of the wound with his hand: and the doctor introduces his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocation between his jaw, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or introduce two thumbs together, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hand are out, with which he equates it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And order the sick person to clean his jaws and eat properly again.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And a doctor should have an equal mandible, and should press the mandible until he returns to his place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both are involved: then administer sweating with warm water and oil until the reduction becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of the teeth at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they have been reduced and made equal, and the jaw has closed, and they have not become swollen: then place a few clean cloths over them, with a wick that has been made from wax: and oil it with rose water.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind it easily with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let it rest on its back: and let the head be supported between two cloths so that it does not move to the right or left: and do not force it to chew anything: but let it be given a soft diet, until such time as the pain subsides, and the jaw has closed: then let it eat what it wants, and administer it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Do not cause any pain during the surgery on his mouth, or difficulty in eating and drinking, or coughing, until such time as the jaw has closed and is healing.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two mandibles becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places: then many times fever and vomiting occur: and perhaps intestinal distension happens, and perhaps pure chole is relieved.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see this then you know that it is a disaster, and many times that person dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of a dislocated furcula, and the extreme end of the humerus bone.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furcula does not dislocate from the inside due to the continuity with the sternum.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocates sometimes toward the outside: and this is felt by touch.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is so that it lies sick on its back, and extends its arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then wrap the place with your palm and wrap it strongly, for she will come back.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put a plaster on it, and wool, and tie it up.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of the limb that follows the bed, and continue with it, are rarely dislocated unless by rare chance.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	That which is dislocated on some day: then it should be reduced and made equal as we have said, and that you be prepared for.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put a plaster on it, and wool, and fasten it up.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And prescribe to the sick person to adhere to rest and quietness until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure the limb of the humerus is reduced when it separates also from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	[De]reduction [of] dislocation [of] the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You know that the humerus is dislocated only in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is that it is dislocated towards the side of the tickle towards the lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	Second is that it is dislocated towards the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated towards the upper part of the humerus: and this is rare.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And does not dislocate towards the back because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And does not dislocate to the front due to nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	Indeed most dislocate and exit towards the lower side towards the tickle: especially in those who have thin flesh.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it exits quickly on them, and enters quickly into them.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those who have much flesh, the opposite is true: that is to say, because it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps happens to some men a blow or a fall, and the humerus is dislocated by a hot poultice, and it is thought because of this that he is already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore let this be your experience until you stand on certain ground, and then proceed to his cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is known that dislocation occurs when it turns downward toward the elbow: and you distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you can clearly see the difference between them; and the dislocation of the shoulder turns toward the head of the arm, and near to the spot where it is touched at the tip of the shoulder: and the sick hand cannot bring its fist to its ear, nor move it in all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And likewise, if it is dislocated toward the chest or upward: then a clear touch is felt, and it does not hide itself.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this kind of dislocation it is easy to make reduction when it is still fresh, or when the boy is sick.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is such that he lifts his own hand upward.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under its tip and with strength bring the joint to its place upward: and let him lift his hand and stretch it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him put it down again, for himself he will quickly recover.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however he does not recover by means of what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the sick man should bathe in warm water, and be given a soothing ointment, such as if they had made to boil the roots of alba nox, and foenugraeum, and melilotum in water, and be administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick man shall lie on his back: and let a sphere and wool be placed under its tip, which is equal to the length of the thumb from the joint.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor shall place his heel on the sphere, and with strength shall lift the shoulder, and attract the sick man's hand downward.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another shall hold the sick man' head so that it does not move downward: for he will quickly recover.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it as follows: and it is such that the longer-term sick man stands by the side, and puts his shoulder under the tip of the sick man: and lift the sick man' s tip upward, until he hangs suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant should take the hand of the patient from below his thigh.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick person is light: then it should be that with him something else is suspended, so as to support him: for the dislocation immediately returns.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced in a second way: and this is that it is fitted to the earth a long piece of wood, the head of which is round figure: like a mortar's hand: that not be thick, nor fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then it is placed under the sick person after the cloth is placed over the head of the wood: and the sick person is standing according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand should be extended from the other side, and his body should be extended with strength: for the joint returns to its place with velocity.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	That if it is difficult to reduce him through all that we have said, then use this care: and this is that you take a piece of wood the length of which is the length of two arms, and its width is the width of four fingers, and its thickness is the thickness of two fingers: whose head is round, so that it eases the entrance into the pit, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied over the round head, so as not to hurt the wood with the sick person.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it is placed under the titillium (palm) of the nurse, so that the hand or arm extends over the wood to the lower part: and the wood is tied to the aid, arm, and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then it is placed over the step by the width, and the hand is extended from the lower side, and the remainder of the body is suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint immediately enters.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Then when his entrance is completed in any way possible: then it should be that you place under the sphera  (ball) of equal size made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then put on a prepared ball of woolen flour with olive oil, and white wine over the whole shoulder, as it turns upside down.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten the stricture under the tip of the finger; and turn back the ligament over the splint; and join his hand to his neck, and let it rest, and do not move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that a weak food be given to him until the member is healed; for it is faster to heal it in this way.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then after seven or five days, he should be set free with motion.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If then it is healed and does not become soft, then it is now healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If then the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture which happens to it, or for some other reason: then it is necessary, that he should be administered in it a cauterium with six holes, according to what has been said in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	That if this is done altogether, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint does not get stiff, and the splint and stricture over it are loosened a little, and does not firm up, and falls, and cannot raise it upward: then you should know that the nerves which go to the shoulder have been cut, or extended, or made soft; and you should know that the joint never gets fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But the dislocation which takes place toward the chest and nipple, or to the rear, is caused by a push and an extension with the hands; until it comes back, and a remaining stricture and cure are administered to it, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	That if something happens after healing to put weight on the member, and delay in its motion: then let the sick person take many baths, until that weight is made soft, and he returns to his natural state first.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the Cure of a Dislocation of the Elbow
Caput XXVIII.	Head of Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the dislocation of the elbow takes place with difficulty, and likewise returns with difficulty; and it itself gets dislocated in all directions, especially to the front, or to the rear.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it falls under vision and under touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated bed with the healthy one, that will be made manifest to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is dislocated and cannot be doubled, nor can it touch with its arm.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should do so, that you reduce the dislocation at once before it happens to him a hot apostema.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it happens to him a hot apostema, its reduction is difficult; and it is certainly not healed completely, especially when it is behind.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse in all forms of dislocation and more painful to them; and often it ends with death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration is when it is taken out of them which can be reduced, that it extends its hand with two hands: and its arm is spread wide, and the doctor's hands are under the bed and beneath him, and he pushes the dislocation with his thumbs of his hands simultaneously, or with the root of his palm, until he returns to his place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or the dislocation is to the front: then he returns so that he doubles his hand with his hand, until he hits against the root of his palm which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Which if it does not obey the reduction, then administer a painful extension, strongly and violently; and it is like to extend the arm of two ministers: and let them hold him of two ministers also, so that he does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm turns around to all parts after it has been wrapped over his hand a long doubled cloth, or a broad ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the dislocation with his hand, he should smear it with oil; so that it is out of them which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he pushes the dislocation with a violent push, until he returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction it is necessary that a plaster be placed on it, in which sits theスティプサイトス、 and drying with alum: and let it be tightly tied as it decreases.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	Let the arm be suspended from the neck of the nurse, and let it be discharged after a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be unscrewed.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	But if the suture is secure in its place, then unfasten the ligature from it, and discharge it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the suture is not well tied, then apply more plaster, and the ligature, and discharge it after a few days until it is tied.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then let it be unscrewed.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if he should have a fall after the reduction of the suture, and his condition be in motion: then administer humidification in bathing, and slight friction, and pressure, until it heals, or put on an ointment of ilium, that is, of sheep's fat.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then fasten the ligature, and discharge it on top of it during the day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce him into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	But when he sweats, then apply friction to the suture with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then change the position of the ointment one time on top, and a second time on entering the bath, until it becomes soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if there is a wound, put on top of it mud, moist, warmed with butter, and tie tightly.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Let this be done sometimes.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it heals, and returns to its own condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	The cure for the dislocation of Al-Mahazzem:
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	If the hand has many fractures, that is, a joint between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of his dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary, the joints of the other hand are difficult to reduce.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Nevertheless, it should be, that the speed of reducing his dislocation be in the hour when he is dislocated, before it is measured: or if it happens in that which is warm.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of his dislocation is this way: that you place the feeble hand of Mahazzem on a table, and let the servant-hand of him stretch it: and the doctor should place his palm on the eminence of the joint, and push it forward, until he brings it back.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Verumtamen oportet ut consyderetur si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manos medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	Verily, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded into the abdomen of the hand: then, place the sick hand of the patient on a table with extension and reduction: and if dislocation is proceeding toward the back of the hand, then position the hand of the patient intrinsically on the table, that is, the interior part of the hand on the table is placed, so that the doctor's hand falls on that eminence of the joint. If he returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then tie it with a plaster while sitting down, and let him go, and do not return to that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manos, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi aut attriti.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Cum ergo non redit Almahessem, tunc pone super ipsumemplاسترunum, quod narrauimus.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitaturos manos.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidit in ea aliquid gravioris: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	De curatione dislocationis digitorum:
Caput XXX.	Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidit in ea aliquid gravioris: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from all parts, or from the back of the hand or palm, or inner part: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumb, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and hang it towards the side where it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang it up, and extend it, until it becomes straight again on its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night comes, then bind it according to the above description: and do not stop to cure it on that day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Make it for a few days, until it gets tight.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with this, if a finger is dislocated towards the inner side of the hand: and bind it to that side, and do your first operation with it, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with this when a finger is dislocated towards any other part.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	The cure for the dislocation of the spine at the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to anyone that the spine at the back is dislocated completely, or many of the vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that a sick person leaves the bed involuntarily, and cannot hold it: and many times some member of his body, or two legs, or two arms, or one of them, grows weak: or one vertebrae of his spine is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For many times the removal happens, which many times occurs on all four sides.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	So the one that is removed towards the back is called a hunchback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	But the cure for this is that you consider then, if hunchback happens during childhood: then there is no cure for it, and there is no healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which happens due to a fall, or impact, or similar things, the ancient methods of cure have been long spoken about by those who are wise.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Who does not recover with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have indeed already brevily quoted from it, which little excuses me for the great distance of my quote from its nearness to my intention: and my own exposition of that, and my forming of an instrument after their manner from him whom they showed it, and from themselves.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say, then, that in the deformity which happens on the anterior part, there is neither an art nor a cure for it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise in that which happens on the two sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And they do not cure these, unless that which happens in the back proper, with what I tell you: and it is as if he extended himself on a level platform near the wall: and spread out underneath him a moist cloth, so that he does not hurt his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood is to be placed on the ground in the foot's extreme end, about its head: and another piece of wood about its feet in the other extreme end: and the minister holds fast that wood, and sits not firmly in the foulard.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another minister is to hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then a nurse is to bend over his head, and under his chin with soft lint, firm: and extend the end of the ligament toward the wood that is at his head: and bind himself therewith.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then a different ligament is to be tightened above his shoulders, and above his knees, and about his loins.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then all the ligaments are to be gathered together, and bound in the other wood that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then every minister is to stretch out toward the wood's side of the ligaments, and not remove the two woods from their places where they are fixed: verily, however, they are not firm, as I have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	Then the doctor is to place his palms on the spine with strength, until he sets it down: or to place it on a board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he attaches his feet to the board, until he sets them down.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not respond to this cure, then take a table whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And put the wound on the wall that we have spoken of, which is near the sick person, in the place where the end of the table is.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then put the middle of the table over the spondyl.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor place his feet on the other end of the table.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tie it well, until the spondyl is tight, and return to your place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you want, operate with a sharp tool that is held in your hand: and it is, so that you place on the ground near the head of the sick person two beams whose length is that of one arm: and near the head of those two beams.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length that is between all the beams should be a palm: and there should be made a hole in every place where the saw runs: and all the wood should be made firm on the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And insert the round wood: and there is a saw that turns the ligament between two holes of two beams.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is a palm with what turns it: and on the other two beams there is also like that.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tie the ligaments that you have tied inside the chest with a saw that is at the head of the sick person: and the ligaments that you have tied on his legs with a saw that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by every saw that serves to turn the hand with a lever, with which the saw turns: and the doctor should equal the spondyl, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the saw, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the spondyl has been equalized and the place has been made equal, then you should put on dried plaster with alumine vinegar.
Deinde stuppam.	Then the poultice.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the plaster a pan of the table whose width is three fingers, or around them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And the length of what he takes up place of gibbosity, and over the sound side.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then he is to be bound with a bond that we have spoken of.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick one be fed with subtle nourishment until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	That if anything of eminence remains in the place at the end of the healing: then it is to be, that which are administered medicines that soften, and loosen, with the administration of the table which we described at length.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now it is to be administered in that leaden plate.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when ever eminence happens to be in the very last of the spine of the back: and it is thought that by means of that dislocation, and it is that joint which has already come forth.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why it should not be supposed to him with this medicine: for perhaps might happen to him death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Of the cure of an ankle dislocated.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter III.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the ankle-joint, and the shoulder-joint, do not happen to a dislocation, unless it is only a dislocation: nor does it happen to them what happens to other joints for a small distance, and pressure.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the ankle-joint itself is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Because it is dislocated forward, and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And much more is dislocated inward: and little is dislocated forward, and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the cure of that dislocation to the inside is: because when you join the leg of the sick with the healthy nurse, it is longer: and his knee-joint is more برجسته than the healthy one, and cannot the sick double his foot in front of the groin: and there is a place which follows the groin warm, therefore, because the hip-joint has already reached that place.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him whose dislocation is to the outside is, that are his opposite accidents to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him whose dislocation is forward, is, that he expands the healthy leg according to complement: verily, he does not double himself without pain which is in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot get over it forward: and he holds his urine, and stands behind his groin, and when he walks, he stumbles on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him to whom dislocation has occurred is, that his leg does not extend, nor can he double it before he doubles his knee: and also his shin bone is shorter on one side: and his kneecap is softened too, and lies at the place of his hip.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction, however, of this dislocation of the eye is, that you should consider then, if the dislocation is new, which has already been healed with the owner of it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you administer the reduction of it, and remains second to its disposition: then is not at all in it the cure.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, therefore, it should not be assumed that it has been cured entirely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in that, which whose dislocation is recent, and has only the four faces of the dislocation: then draw near to this, so you rotate it, and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it with the right and left: for maybe it will come back again, and will not need another cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if this does not do so in this way, then you should prepare, that you extend the leg of him from the lower part: or with his hands, or with a ligature which binds above the leg of him: and another minister extends his hand of him from above, so that he thrusts his hands under his toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then tie it with a soft ligature on the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let him be sitting in an extended position or from the front part of the groin to the side of the thigh, or from the back to the side of the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let all these be extended in one direction, until he raises himself up with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	This is a species of reduction which is common to the four faces.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	But if the dislocation returns with him that I have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary that each species that I call about its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	For when the dislocation is internal, it is necessary that the sick one lie on his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should put a ligature over the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he should extend the ligature upwards from the groin on one side to the other side of the body, to the femur.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong minister should take his arm, and reduce the thick part of the hip that is weak, and stretch it outward with a powerful extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now he has returned to his own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind of cure is easier than the other kinds of surgery, since this limb can be reduced in this way.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if he does not comply with you at all in this kind of surgery: then it is necessary that two ministers should be bound together with a strong ligature, soft and gentle, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each from its counterpart be of the quantity of four fingers: and let the leg of the infirm person be stretched out by a quantity of two fingers more than the other.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the infirm person should be suspended on the head of the ligature, which is in the house: and let the length of him from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong youth to support the head of the hip: and another should support the infirm person with his arms: and another should push from behind with strength, for the joining should return to its own place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In the reduction of his own, when it is a dislocation that is external, it is necessary that the infirm person should lie on the ground, according to which we have spoken in having a gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And a ligature should be stretched over his own infirm leg and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two stakes should be placed, one at the feet of him, and another at the head of him.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a wooden stake should be placed in the middle of his foot, firmly fixed: and there should be laid wet cloths so that they do not hurt the infirm one: and let the stake be between his hips, so that it does not draw towards the lower part by extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let all the ministers extend to their parts, and the doctor shall give an equal reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	But if he obeys in regard to reversion, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, let him place a table over it, and press it equally, as we have said in regard to curvature,
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, he should lie on his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then let the crural members be extended quickly: and it is according to this that he relates to the floor: and let the doctor place his right hand palm on the hip of the sick person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then let him be held with the other hand, and with that holding let him be extended towards the lower side of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not appropriate that the sick person should be extended towards the lower side, and should sit raised on the ground: but he should be placed on a hard thing, as we have said also if his hips are displaced outward, according to what we said regarding his lying on two pillows: and it is on his face, and the extensors stretched: as we have just said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And let there be given a compression with the table also to the place to which the joint departs, when the reduction is completed, according to what should be done.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his reduction should not be hidden from you: and it is, that you should extend the two crural members: and when you see them equal, and the sick person draws in his legs, and stretches himself out without excuse: then you know that he has already recovered the member: then join the two hips together, and put a splint on, and fasten with a thong, that is to say, turn it: so that it may not move outward to some part: and let him adhere in quietness for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loose the ligaments, and splint, and bring together the crural members with each other: then if you see them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation has already healed: so let the sick person go, to walk about.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then return, and bandage it, and tighten it according to your first stricture: and also let go of it after three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen that, and make him walk a little on either side for several days, until he is well comfortable.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	(Here is the section "On the dislocation of the knee":)
Caput XXXIII.	CHAPTER III.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	(The knee can be dislocated in three ways.)
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	(It can be dislocated outward, inward, and downward, that is to say, toward the back.)
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	(And it does not dislocate toward the front.)
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	(And the sign of its dislocation is that, as you instruct the sick person, he applies his knee to his hip.)
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	(But if it does not adhere to the hip: then you shall know that the knee is dislocated.)
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	(And the restoration of all types of dislocation is that you make the sick person sit upright, so that he can extend his leg over it if he can, and fasten his back against your face: and place his foot between your feet.)
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then attach the knee of the sick person to your palms, and place them straight between your fingers over his knee.)
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	(Then apply with your two hands on each side of the knee with force.)
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	(And another minister should extend his foot, until the knee returns to its place.)
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	(And the sign of restoration is that the hip adheres to the knee with ease, not with effort.)
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bandage him, and make the hip adhere to the knee.)
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together at the same time for three or four days.)
Deinde solue ea.	(Then loosen them.)
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	(And let the sick person not walk for several days until he is well.)
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	(But if it does not reduce to you on its own, then administer a strong extension with ligaments, of which the following is a description in the healing of an aching joint, until it returns.)
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	De curatione dislocationis calcanei.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34. On the treatment of a dislocated heel-bone.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	When the calcaneus is sometimes reduced by slight manipulation and sometimes dislocates with respect to the talus.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And this dislocation may be either inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of this dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen and protruding toward the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The cure for this reduction, however, is easy; that is, to extend it with ease with the hands and to adjust it, until it comes back into place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of it, however, when it dislocates with respect to the talus, it is necessary that you cause the sick person to sit upright: and hold him firmly from the rear part of his back, in the middle of his heel.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold him with your right hand on the upper part of his foot, and with your left hand at the lower part of his foot, where there is a small knuckle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw his foot toward you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the two joints of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with your left hand, and push the heel toward the chest with your right hand without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the heel toward the shin in a third movement, and you draw the knuckle.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it then returns in one movement or two according to this method and you see the foot steady, it is good; but if not, then repeat the operation on him: for he will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is prohibited from being reduced with him lying as we have described: then let him lie on his back on the ground, and fix a hard peg firmly into the ground so that it may fall between his thighs: and you shall now be able to stretch him out smoothly on top of it, so that he is not hurt.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the minister take his leg: then extend the other minister's foot, or with his hands, or with a band that ties over the top of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all ministers extend against the extension of his own comparar (hand/arm), and let a nurse stand between two hips holding him back, so that his body is not drawn downward during extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should make his hands equal, and the other minister (nurse) should hold the healthy leg from below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For dislocation returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and you are told that it is a good return: then place a splint and a bandage, and tie it with ligaments tightly, and bind the foot with a ligament to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And you should beware of the nerves that are above the heel bone behind, lest a strong ligament hurt them, and they hurt.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him be discharged after two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	Now if the ligament is softened, tie him up: then dissolve him on the third or fourth day: and prohibit the sick one from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if he should try to walk before that space, there is no security except that the dislocation be dissolved above him, and it becomes corrupted, and does not receive after that cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	Now if he should happen to have a swelling that is hot: then you should administer in his sedation that which we told of in another place from the cure, and a poultice, until it goes away.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Of dislocation of the fingers of the foot, and cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXVI.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that he be equal who dislocates from them with a little extension without work: and it is not difficult, indeed, but easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the back of the foot: then you should make the sick one put his foot on an equal place of the earth, or on a board: and he stands as one who walks.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand still, and place your foot on that which protrudes from them by the joint.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then kick that with your foot strongly, until it returns, and does not appear to be in a high place in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under his foot his sole plate which takes the whole foot, of which there are two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tie him up with a tight binding for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen him and let him rest from walking for many days, until he is loosened and secured from the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	¶ On the species of dislocation with a sprain or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Head XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens to him and you are anxious about his cure and restoration, often death follows: and for that reason it is not right to be hasty about his cure, which is of this kind, unless he who practices the art is prudent in the use of long-term drugs, merciful, compassionate, slow, not bold, and not presumptuous; and that he uses the medicines which sit on the surface with warm water only: and that he dismisses the sick with divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you are convinced, or hope for salvation from ruin with mildness of sickness, and to which appears some hope of recovery.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Consider, therefore, the reduction of him at once at the beginning of the thing, before a warm poultice happens.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	But if the limb returns, according to our wishes, then administer the regimen which sits on the poultice: and take care of the wound with him when it suits him from the drying ointment.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	That if the dislocation is with a fracture, and things happen in the bone of separated joints, then consider their removal, and do in him what we have said in simple illnesses because it has preceded in places of them.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And lead according to your wisdom, and guard yourself from the entrance into a state of fear: according to my prediction for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more remaining to your glory, and more safe to your body with them at their time.
