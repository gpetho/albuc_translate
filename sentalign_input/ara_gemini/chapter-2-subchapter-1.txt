The first chapter on the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment often occurs to boys at birth if the midwife squeezes the boy's head without gentleness.
It may also occur from a hidden cause that is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than boys.
And all of those whom I have seen with it, death came to them quickly.
Therefore, I have decided to abandon treating it.
And I have certainly seen among them a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day until the boy could not sit up on his own due to the size of his head.
And the moisture increased until he perished.
And this moisture either gathers between the skin and the bone, or it gathers beneath the bone on the periosteum.
And the treatment for that, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, it is necessary to make one horizontal incision in the middle of the head, and the length of the incision should be about two knuckles so that the moisture flows out.
And this is a picture of the lancet.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make it two intersecting incisions in this way:
And if the moisture is under the bone
and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side
and the water sinks in when you press it with your hand
and that is not hidden from you
then it is necessary that you make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, all the moisture comes out.
Then the incisions are tightened with bandages and compresses.
Then it is moistened from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then the bandage is loosened, and the wound is treated with bandages and ointments.
And do not neglect to tighten the head moderately.
And the patient is fed with all dry food, low in moisture, until the organ strengthens and heals.
Another method of incision is to look where the bone of the swelling and the accumulation of water appear.
Because it may be more in the back of the head or in the front of it, or on the right or on the left.
So you aim the incision where the swelling and the fullness of water appeared to you.
So you incise it as best you can.
And be careful not to cut an artery, causing bleeding, so that the patient dies from that bleeding with the discharge of moisture.
