of erysipelas
Erysipelas occurs when a woman's genitals are not perforated, or the opening is small; and this is natural by birth, or accidental due to a disease that has occurred; or it is due to extra flesh, or from a thin or thick syfac, and it is located deep in the uterus, or on the sides, or underneath, or wherever it may be; and it prevents conception, and childbirth, and sometimes menstruation; and the diagnosis of this is by examination of the vulva.
If the blockage is near and visible, then search with your fingers or with a probe.
If it is from a thin syfac, and it is close to the two labia, then hurry, and break it thus: put your two index fingers together, and have the woman lie on her back, with her legs spread; then stretch the two labia firmly, until the thin syfac is broken, and the blockage is opened; then take wool, and soak it in oil, and put it on the spot, and let the woman lie still every day, so that it cannot close up.
And if the syfac is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a myrtle-leaf shaped scalpel.
If the blockage is from excess flesh, then lift it with a hook and cut it; and have medicines to stop the bleeding, such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, together with egg white; then insert a wide lead tube, so that the wound cannot close; and let it remain thus for a long time, and apply a dry linen tent; then treat with other remedies until it is healed.
And when excess flesh grows in the womb, it must be cut in this manner, unless it is a malignant abscess.
For a malignant abscess that is in the womb, one should not touch it with iron.
