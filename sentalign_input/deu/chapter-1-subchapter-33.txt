Chapter Thirty-Three:
On the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is affected by cold and humidity, weakening the digestive and retentive functions of the stomach and intestines, and it is treated using conventional methods without success, sometimes the patient may require cauterization for beneficial results. Then cauterize with a large cautery on the stomach as previously described for stomach cauterization, with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauterizations around the navel, using a thin nail-like cautery; and cauterize on the prominent part with one large cautery, or two cauterizations.
If the excess humidity persists and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize the lower abdomen and intestines, adding two more cauterizations on the stomach and near the groin, as this treatment is highly effective.
