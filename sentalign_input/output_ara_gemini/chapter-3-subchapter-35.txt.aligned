Whenever something like this happens, and you intend to treat it and fix it, it often results in death.	When anything of this kind happens and you attempt treatment and restoration, death is a frequent sequel.	0.83849573
Therefore, no one should attempt to treat such a thing except someone who is skilled in the craft, long-experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, neither reckless nor daring.	Therefore such treatment should be undertaken only by a person that is skilled in the art, has long experience, is dexterous, sympathetic, cautious, and not reckless or over-bold.	0.84929496
And he should use, in the beginning, only the medicines that soothe hot swellings and entrust the sick person to fate - God willing - except for what you hope for his safety from damage, along with the mildness of the illness and you see in it some hope.	To begin with he should apply only remedies for the allaying of abscesses and then leave the patient to Divine providence, unless, of course, the injury is light enough to give some hope of his escaping death; in which case you should set out to reduce it at once before an abscess arise.	0.72534704
So send him away immediately at the beginning of the matter before the hot swelling occurs, and if the limb returns to what you wanted, then use the regimen that soothes hot swellings and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments.	If the part goes back as you wish, employ the treatment for allaying abscesses and dress the wound with suitable desiccant ointments.	0.60608816
If the jaw is fractured and bone fragments that are loose occur, then extract them and follow in that what we mentioned in simple diseases from what preceded in their places.	If it be a dislocation with a fracture and there occur splintered fragments in the bone, try to remove them, following therein the instructions relating to the simple diseases we have mentioned before in their place.	0.8497629
And strive your utmost and keep yourself from entering the path of risks, as I have previously advised you, for that is more preserving of your prestige and safer for your honor, God willing.	Use your utmost diligence; keep clear of entering upon a course with a dangerous outcome, as I have enjoined on you before. For this will best ensure the continuance of your prestige and safeguard your good name, God willing.	0.8105937
