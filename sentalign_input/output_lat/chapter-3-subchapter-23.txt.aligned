Discourse on dislocations.	On the discussion of dislocation.	0.83932126
A dislocation is a displacement of any of the joints from its place, whereby the movement of the joint is hindered, the member is deformed, and the patient is caused violent pain and hurt.	Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its natural position. Thus it is prevented from movement, and the limbâ€™s form is disfigured. It causes the patient severe pain and injury.	0.83741987
When anyone sustains a dislocation he should hasten to have it reduced, not delaying it at all.	Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to quickly restore it and not delay at all.	0.68393
For if it is delayed the place will swell up and the reduction will be thereby made difficult.	For if delayed, the area may become inflamed, and perhaps hinder the reduction of the dislocation.	0.73294103
So it should not be delayed, nor moved or extended during the time it is swollen, for that often leads to spasm and excruciating pain.	For this reason, it should not be moved or extended when it is inflamed. Since often it causes spasms and harmful pains.	0.86134005
Instead, when this occurs, you must hasten to venesect the patient, and then let be until the swelling has subsided a little.	But when this happens, you must promptly perform bloodletting on the patient. Then leave it until the inflammation subsides.	0.79076767
Then massage the member with hot water and oil and let it be gently reduced.	Then rub the limb with warm water and oil. Then it should be reduced with ease.	0.81870437
And treat every member with the things that will be mentioned in their place.	And treat every limb with the appropriate remedy, which will be discussed in its proper place.	0.69335735
I have disposed the chapters on dislocations in the same order as the foregoing ones on fractures, that is, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.	Indeed, I have already organized the chapters on dislocation, just as in fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower.	0.8371691
