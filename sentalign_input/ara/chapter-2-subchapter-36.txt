Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the Treatment of Swelling of the Tonsils.
And what grows in the throat from all other swellings.  Swellings similar to those that appear externally, called tonsils, may appear inside the throat, if you treat them with what I mentioned in the incision and they do not heal.
So observe, if the swelling is hard, dark in color, and with little sensation, do not treat it with iron.  And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not treat it with iron either, for fear of bleeding.  Rather, leave it until it ripens, then either incise it or let it burst on its own.
And if it is white, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut. The procedure for it is that you observe, before operating, if its acute swelling has completely subsided or decreased somewhat.
Then, sit the patient near the sun with his head in your lap. Open his mouth and have an assistant in front of you press his tongue down with an instrument like this:
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you have pressed down the tongue and the swelling is apparent and visible, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes with it.
Then cut it with an instrument shaped like this, resembling scissors except that its two ends are curved, with each blade facing the other, very sharp, made of Indian iron or Damascene steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel shaped like this:
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other. After you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.  Then, after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops, then treat him until he recovers.  Other swellings may grow in the throat besides the tonsils, so cut them as I mentioned regarding cutting the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a swelling that had grown inside her throat, extending somewhat towards the uvula, almost completely blocking the throat.  The woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had prevented her from eating and drinking water.
She was near death, if she had remained a day or two longer. The swelling had put forth two branches that extended to her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserting a hook into one of them, and then I pulled it, extracting a good-sized piece.
Then I cut it where it reached her nostril. Then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth and depressed her tongue, and inserted the hook into the swelling itself, and cut some of it.  Only a little blood flowed from it.
The woman's throat was opened, and she immediately began to drink water and then took some food. We continued to cut from that swelling repeatedly for a long time, and the swelling would regrow in place of what was cut, until I and she became weary of it.
So I resorted to cauterizing the swelling inside her throat with a cautery iron, and it stopped growing. Then I left the area and I did not know what God did with her after me.
