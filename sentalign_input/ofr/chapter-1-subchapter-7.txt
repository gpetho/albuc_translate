When apoplexy is long-standing and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries:
Two on the two temples of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the pit of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
