Chapter Thirty-One.
On Extracting Tooth Roots and Removing Broken Jaw Bones.
If, when extracting a tooth, a root remains broken, you should place cotton with oil on the area for a day or two until the area softens, then insert the forceps or hooks.
whose ends resemble the beak of the bird called hoopoe.  And this is the image of the hooks:.
It should be made like a rasp on the inside, or like a scalpel.  If it does not yield to extraction with these hooks, then you should excavate around the root and expose all the flesh with the scalpel, then insert the instrument that resembles a small lever, which is pictured here:.
Short-tipped, slightly thick, and not pointed, lest it break. If the root comes out with that, then good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are pictured here. The first has a triangular tip and is somewhat thick:
Another delicate triangular image:.
We may also use this two-pronged instrument, which is also pictured here:.
And with other instruments and irons that were mentioned earlier in the extraction of molars. We may also use this instrument that resembles a large hook, which is pictured here:.
Triangular-tipped, curved, somewhat thick so that it does not break, and not pointed.  Know that the instruments for molars are many, as are all other instruments, and they are almost countless. The skilled and experienced craftsman may invent instruments for himself according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate to him.
Because there are some diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, due to the variation in their types. If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decayed, then investigate it in its place with whatever is appropriate for it from one of these instruments and hooks that were mentioned for extracting roots.
And we use a forceps, which is pictured here:.
It should have some thickness so that the bone can be grasped with it and not escape until the bone is extracted. And we treat the area with appropriate medications. If there is slight decay in the bone, scrape it from its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
