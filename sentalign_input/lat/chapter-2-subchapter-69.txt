On Castration.
Chapter 69.
Know that castration is condemned in our law: and because of that, it would be permissible for me to not mention it in this book of mine: and mentioning it is not necessary, except for two reasons.
One of which is so that it is in the knowledge of the physician when he is asked about it: and so that he knows the treatment of one to whom it happens.
And the other reason is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our benefit through it, such as rams, goats, cats, and similar animals.
I say, therefore, that castration is done in two ways.
Either by rubbing.
Or by splitting and cutting.
In that which is done by rubbing, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until its testicles are softened, relaxed, and hang down: then rub them with your hand, until they are dissolved and do not appear under touch.
In castration by splitting and cutting, however, it is necessary to restrain the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie a suspensory band, and make one cut over each testicle until both testicles come out: then cut them after you have stripped each one, and leave nothing from the membrane except the thin layer, which is above the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than the one done by rubbing: because rubbing may perhaps leave something of the testicles, which causes the animal to desire mating.
Then treat the wound until it is healed.
