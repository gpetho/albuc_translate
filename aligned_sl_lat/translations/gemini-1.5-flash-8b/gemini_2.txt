Having completed for you, children, this book, which is the final treatise on medicine with its completion, and having attained its end through its expositions and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practice of surgery, that is, of surgery with the hand.
Since the practice of surgery is neglected in our region and in our time, entirely private, until perhaps its knowledge perished and its trace was cut off, and nothing remained of it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which were altered by hands, and error and hesitation befell them, until its intentions were closed and its power was estranged; it seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this treatise, in it according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I would come with the forms of the instruments of cautery, and the other instruments of the craft, with the addition of the declaration, and with the hastening of what is necessary.
The reason why a skilled practitioner of surgery is not found with his hands in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, as Galen narrated, until he knows the supports of the limbs, and their shapes, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, tendons, and their numbers, and their exits, and the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
And therefore Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, but with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We, however, have already spoken of that in the introduction to this book.
Because whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy is not free from falling into error, whereby people are killed; as I have seen many of those who are formed in this knowledge, and boast of it without knowledge, and without experience.
This is because I saw a foolish physician cut a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some arteries in her neck; wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large. Therefore, he reached it, and extracted it with a fragment of the bladder. Therefore, the man died on the third day.
And I myself had already been called to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician, who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land for medicine; and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician, in his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound an outlet.
Then he discharged him according to his desires. Afterwards, he dismissed him after a few days, and commanded him not to loosen the bandage; and it stood thus until his leg and foot were suppurated, and he came to destruction.
I was therefore called to him; and I hurried to loosen the bandage; and tranquility followed, and he escaped from his pains.
However, the corruption had already become established in the limb; and I was unable to restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to travel in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous abscess; and it ulcerated after days, until its malice was magnified with its owner.
That is because when the cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate having the whole of it cut off.
And therefore, my sons, it is necessary for you to know that surgery, with the hand, is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery to which health is associated; and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions.
And I have already aroused in every place of this book, where surgery comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to cut it short, so that fools do not find a way to speak and to dishonour.
Therefore, receive the measure with care and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better path leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy succession; and abandon terrible illnesses difficult to heal; and remove your minds from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter into your faith and your well-being.
For there remains more for your glory, and more sublime in this world, and ultimately more for your possessions.
For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician.
Now, however, I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
First chapter.
Concerning the cautery with fire, and the cautery with a sharp medicine, the subject matter, and the order, from head to foot, and the forms of instruments, and the tools of the cautery: and everything necessary in the operation.
Second chapter.
Concerning the incision and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things to those: and the whole subject matter, ordered by the forms of instruments.
Third chapter.
Concerning the restoration, and dislocation, and the cure of twisting, and similar things to those: the subject matter, ordered from head to foot, and the forms of instruments.
But before I recount the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms, and in what constitution it is to be applied.
I say, therefore, that the discussion of the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a matter of knowledge and a hidden secret.
Many wise men have spoken on it, and disagreed on it; and for me, a little from their pronouncements suffices, fearing the extension.
I say, therefore, that the cautery is beneficial to every constitution, which is with matter and without matter: except for two constitutions, which are a hot constitution without matter, and a dry constitution without matter.
However, they disagreed in the hot and dry constitution with matter. For some said that the cautery is helpful in it. And others said the opposite, namely that the cautery is not suitable in a sickness which arises from heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat; and it is unsuitable that a sickness of heat and dryness be cured with heat and dryness.
And he who says the opposite of this said: that through the cautery is help given in every hot and dry illness which occurs in human bodies; because when you compare the human body and its humours to the constitution of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I myself say through his speech, because through experience it has already revealed that to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that one apply it [the cautery] unless one has already been proven and practiced in the final exercise of cautery, and knows the diversity of human constitutions, and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the duration of those illnesses.
However, there is no fear from the other constitutions; and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For all physicians have already agreed on them [cold and moist illnesses]; and they have not disagreed on the help provided by the cautery in them.
And know, children, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach except the limb that is cauterized, and does not harm another limb joined to it, except with a small harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the limbs, and perhaps causes a difficult-to-heal illness in the limb, and perhaps kills it.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
Now indeed, that has become known to us through experience, because of the length of service and study with the art, and the standing on the truth of things; and because of that, I excuse myself from the length of discourse.
And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would reveal to you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation on the bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses, demonstrated by a philosophical, demonstrative discourse, which would be sharpened by your minds.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be applied, and place a better time in the spring.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm that is incidental to the time is submerged in the benefit which is drawn along with the cautery. And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, swift pains, which do not tolerate slowness; because it is feared from them that a greater harm may occur than the slight harm that enters because of the time.
And do not let it enter your minds, O children, that which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely that the ailment which is cured by cautery does not always return; and they consider this a consequence, and the matter is not as they think; because cautery is not, except in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humidities that are the cause why pains occur.
However, cautery surpasses medicine in the swiftness of its health, and the strength of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion; and it is possible that the illness may return at some hour of time according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of their illness, and its strength; and that which is prepared in their body from the aggregation of superfluities in it; and that which reaches them in their acquisition from foods, and similar things from such causes, unless it is the illness in which cautery is administered.
A subtle illness in a limb, of few superfluities and humidities, like the cautery of a tooth, on account of pain, and similar things to it, it is possible, indeed, that that pain will not return in it. But that happens in few.
But indeed the talk of the common people, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is correct speech; not as they intend it, however, because they believe that there is no cure which compares with medicine, nor with anything after the cautery has passed.
However, the matter is the opposite of that, and the idea that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not so, unless when we administer modes of treatment for an illness, and those remedies do not work; then, at the end of the matter, we administer cautery, and it works; then, from this, it falls that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the excellence of its substance; and they said that the place of the cautery does not produce pus. But that is not absolutely so; because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do so in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said. However, when you make a cautery of gold in fire, you are not shown when it is heated to the quantity you wish, because of the redness of the gold; and when it quickly approaches cold, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman falls from that into a dilemma: and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and nearer for us in appropriateness for the operation.
And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters; and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that those seeking what they want from it may be relieved.
Chapter II.
This cauterization benefits by mastering the humidity and coldness above the brain; these two are the causes of headaches, and the multitude of flowing humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and the multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and universally all sickness that occurs from coldness, such as paralysis, and headaches, epilepsies, and apoplexies, and similar illnesses to them.
The method of cauterization is, that you instruct the sick person: that he be emptied first with a cleansing, dissolving medicine on the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his custom requires.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor. Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever, therefore, your middle finger arrives, mark that place with cautery.
Then apply the olive-shaped cautery iron: this is its form.
Then place it on the marked place with cautery, with a descent, so that your hand is gradually tightened, and you will turn it. Then quickly lift your hand and look at the place.
If you see a quantity of alkiel or zeuherbi already exposed from the bone, then lift your hand. And if not, repeat the application of your hand with the iron itself, or with another if it has cooled: until the bones I spoke of appear.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it, and place it on the place, and leave it for three days.
Then place the cloth soaked in butter on it, and leave it on the place until the scab of the fire is destroyed. Then treat it with the four-drug ointment, until it is healed.
Now they say that the more a wound remains open, the more it discharges pus: wherefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until a certain thickness of bone is burned.
Then that which is burned from the bone should be scraped off, then treated.
And others say that it is necessary to proceed with the cautery to the extreme, until it makes an impression in the bone, so that the bone falls, which happens as if a kirate form were there: or like the instrument which women place on an infused alphabet small: and they believe that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it consolidates.
However, these two kinds of cautery do not seem to me to be useful except in some people, according to a fearful way.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with the preservation of his health.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have observed in other limbs; and especially when the head of the sick person is naturally weak. And indeed, the first kind of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore, operate with it to ensure health.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and it lingers in the sick person, and they use leeches, and cupping, and head-purgations, and oils, and poultices. And especially if it has already been cauterized with the one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things benefit it: then consider. For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and encounters intense cold, then cauterize with another cautery beneath it a little. Then cauterize it itself on every horn of its head with a cautery, so that it does not pierce the skin, and a quantity of bone, as we described, is not exposed. And cauterize it with one cautery in the back of its head, in the place called the *vas* (vessel), which is the place where a cupping glass is placed; and raise your cautery in this area, and do not expose bone. For the sick person experiences intense pain on account of it, and different from the pain of the other cauteries of all the head.
And I shall say this cautery is in its proper place; and it should be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its back [occiput] with a finer cautery, with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Chapter Four.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is purged with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment, which I have described in the divisions of diseases, is administered, and yet that does not wholly benefit it: then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning sharp medicine, or with iron.
The cautery with a burning sharp medicine is: to take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its extremities from both sides. Then open the place of pain with a broad lancet, until a space is made under the skin, in which the clove is inserted.
Then insert it into the space under the skin, until it is hidden; then bind it over with a suitable constriction with a bandage, and leave it for fifteen hours; then loosen it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterward apply a poultice soaked in butter, until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish to do it with certain burning medicines, which I have written in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
The cauterization of it with iron, is according to this method. A cautery of fire, whose form is this.
And it is called a Clavil, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is a certain curve, and in its middle is a small eminence.
Then place it on the spot, and hold your hand; and you turn the iron slowly with speed; and let the amount that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, like half of it. And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak a poultice in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then place the poultice with butter; afterward treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-point. And beware of the incision of the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an old one.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in an old hemicrania.
When you treat hemicrania, along with what we said in the previous treatment, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and if treatment does not help; and you see from the illness that what we said about the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, does not suffice, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery knife until it whitens, after marking the site of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or thereabouts; and place your hand on one side, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during chewing, lest the side or the nerve that moves it be burned, whence spasm may result.
And be on guard, and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut. For in its cutting lies danger, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious nor experienced: and he abandons the operation with that in the first place.
And I will come with a reminder of the regimen for blood flow arising from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
If, however, you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we spoke of in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with the cautery having two knives. For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
Concerning the method of cauterization for ear pain.
When pain in the ear occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies, and with the other treatment that we have discussed in the division, and the pain is not removed, then apply a cautery with fire: and that is what is called a Point, whose shape is this.
Then apply the points, after its ignition, in a circuit around the entire ear, as it revolves; or in a circuit around each ear, if pain is present in both simultaneously. And withdraw the cautery slightly from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink; and the cautery's quantity should be ten points in each ear, and approximately of that size.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a case of torture.
Chapter VII.
Torture which is treated with cauterization is only of the types that occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
And avoid cauterization of the type that occurs from desiccation and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of torture with leeches, and head purges, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the afflicted with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little lower from its temporal location, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery opposite the affected part. Because softening does not occur, unless in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of the cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery directly on the upper extremity of the ear under the horn of the head a little: and another in the temporal region: whose length is according to the length of the thumb. And place your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type from a knife, whose form has been previously stated: however, it is not a little more delicate than that, as you see: and it is necessary that the knife in it have a little superfluous thickness.
Then treat the places, with what has preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ancient apoplexy.
When apoplexy is prolonged, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what has gone before: and the method of the cautery be according to what has gone before.
Also, he is cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is the most extreme.
Then he is treated with what has gone before.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that in the drink be given first to the sick large hyerae, and pills that cleanse the brain.
Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on the back of his head a plaster of mustard described in the treatise on plasters: and place it repeatedly.
For that is the method of cautery, and do it according to the same order which I said there.
If therefore he is cured by it, it is good. If not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which shall be descending from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Then treat the cautery with what preceded it.
If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is able to tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle. If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form that was given before.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
You should proceed in cleansing the head with hyeeris, and with what we have said.
Then shave the patient's head; afterward, cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on its back, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
However, if the illness requires softening of the body with more than those [mentioned], and the patient is a weak tolerator, and the illness is severe, then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and the last with a cautery, until a large portion of his skin is burned, and raise your hand. Then treat him until he is healed; and thus the cautery of Oliuare.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the rest of the treatment that we have described in the division; when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant of taking medicine.
However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicine, then a gargle and chewing to cleanse the brain are administered, for many days beforehand, along with improved food.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has gone before in the method; and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery on every horn of his head. If, however, the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries I described for paralysis, and for the softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded.
If, however, the patient is a child, then apply a thin cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Melancholy.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we have described for paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of the downward tendency towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what was previously stated in the division; then shave the patient's head, and afterward make a neatly fashioned pad of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head, and the patient, seated upright, must be held securely on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is best made from old sheep's butter. And heat it over a fire with a moderate heat, which the finger can tolerate when it is inserted into it. Then apply it to the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the sick person once a week, with the rest of his good regime, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures throughout it, provided that you hold the cautery iron: indeed, let it smell.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place over it a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs that I said in the division, then begin and drink the weak one, with that which cleanses his head.
And keep him from all moisture, and have him sit in a bath, fasting for a few days.
Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if it is the beginning of the descent of water into both eyes at once; or from one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye: and cut away with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be in length equal to the width of the temples; and beware of a flow of blood.
If you see anything from him, then cut it away immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and the caution from the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries finally applied.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ancient weeping.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient, persistent, and situated over the veins and arteries that are visible on the outer head, confirming that it arises from cold, phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize with the same cautery as I described at the beginning for descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones. And if it requires further treatment, then cauterize it on every side of the eye's cavity, above the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a nasal odor.
When you treat it, as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, then act quickly and give the weak person infirmed cochias for three nights; then shave his head and cauterize it with a middle cautery, together with an olive-shaped cautery. Then cauterize it with a key-shaped cautery, with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows, beneath the hair a little.
And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the form of the key-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the softening of the eyelid.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every side; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not move your hand with the cautery to the end, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted, piercing the eye.
The cautery in it is according to two methods: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In cautery with fire, beforehand, tell the sick person to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who cleanses them, until they are extended and made equal. If, however, they pierce him near their origin, then bind his eyes with a strip so that they do not move until they grow.
When therefore they grow and are equal, then place the head of the sick person in your lap; then mark above the eyelids of his eyes with ink, a sign that is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, on the eye.
Then apply the cautery, whose form is this.
Then cauterize over the figure which you marked gradually in many stages, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned away.
And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid already contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place on it a poultice with butter, until the eschar is removed. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
If any of the hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid softens, then again cauterize that place, as you did at first.
If however the hairs are in the lower eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural position and the hairs are even so that they do not prick the eye.
You should instruct the sick person to let the hairs fall out until they are lengthened and even. Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper or cloth.
Then take from known soap, and from unsoaked lime, one ounce or nearly that of each: then grind them together with good rubbing, and do it quickly so that it does not grow cold. Then spread a piece of that (mixture) onto the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one or two eyes. And place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white: and let the sick person's head be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a little while. And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's biting: because its biting is found to be like fire.
So long as he finds this biting, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger. When the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid rising, as it rises with contraction with fire, or with incision, it is well; and if not, then again place medicine on the place where the medicine does not imprint, and does not darken, until your operation is equal, and the eye contracts.
Then place on it a poultice with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated. Then treat it with diaphanicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you at the operation, that you guard the last guard, lest something of the medicine fall into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after days, and something struggles from the hairs into the eye, then again place medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid properly, as you did at first. Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and smallness. Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be; and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who has a study of this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
When you treat a fistula, as with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not benefit: then, it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Tell the sick person to place their head in your lap, and let the attendant hold their head in their hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with their head.
Then place a cautery, dipped in the white of an egg or in psyllium mucilage, over their eye. Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made. And if you want it to be penetrating all the way to the other end, and if you want it held in this upward position.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye, toward the part of the nose, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person is not disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
If therefore you reach the beginning of your cautery up to the bone, it will be well. And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Then place a cloth with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed.
If forty days have passed and it is not healed, then place upon it a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cautery of fistulas, which some of the first ones said. Direct your attention to the location of the fistula, and cut it open; then place within the fissure a fine camahan, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is this. And pour into it a quantity of a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with a good retaining cannula, and let the sick person not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place upon the eye of the sick person a poultice soaked in egg white, or in water.
For lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous cure.
If the fistula is healed with what we have said from cautery and treatment, that is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening, and to redirect the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will return to its own proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called hairs, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, as we said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help, then use a small knife cautery with fire, according to this form.
And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then place it [the cautery] ignited quickly onto the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then treat it with a cautery, until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the fistula of the mouth.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth; then it produces pus, and breaks open; afterwards it becomes chronic, and runs pus, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and treatment does not help it, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with a cautery according to its size. Then insert the hot iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its depth and end; do it once or twice.
Then treat it afterward, with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the pus is removed and it heals, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what comes in its head.
Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
When the gum softens due to moistures, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then with fire, a cautery, whose form will follow after this, so that you place the Cannula upon the tooth: and quickly insert into it the burning Cautery: and hold your hand for a short time, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire now having reached the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand: then repeat the Cautery several times, as you wish.
Then let the sick person fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and let them spit it out.
For the tooth that moves is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in toothache.
When toothache is due to cold, or there is cold or a worm within it, and treatment with medicines does not help: then the cautery is applied to it in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
The cautery with butter is to take cow's butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a vessel. Then take a piece of cotton, and wrap it around the end of the probe. Then immerse it in the boiled butter; and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; and place a heated iron upon it, until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Its cauterization with fire is to apply a bronze tube or an iron tube. And let there be something of thickness in his body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick man's bone.
Then take the cautery, whose form will come; and place it on that tooth; and hold your hand, until the cautery cools.
Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or on another day.
And it is necessary, during the application of that cautery, that the sick man fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever extremity of force is possible; and this is the form of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterization in strophules.
When strophules are caused by phlegm and cold humors, and are not yielding to digestion by medicines, and force is needed to speed their digestion, then use a concave cautery, whose shape is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may escape from the cautery at the other end; and place it, heated, upon the abscess once, and twice, if it needs it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place on it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire has burned away is removed.
Then treat it with a tooth ointment, until the shape of the cannula is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
When humidities overcome the bronchial passage, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the sick person be evacuated in the first place with dissolving medicines.
Then cauterize it in the nocrati at the root of the throat in the depressed place: and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, except a certain part of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the joint of the neck at the last vertebra thereof, and let the cautery be a small one according to the method which preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in diseases of the lungs and cough.
When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the patient does not have fever, nor consumption, and the illness is old, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in low, smooth, empty places. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be of a cannula according to the form that preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, called a Point, whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the points be from thirty points up to, as it were, others.
Then treat him with that which preceded, until he is healed.
And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form. Therefore, the cauterization is alleviated when you do it with three cauteries at once.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the arm is dislocated due to moisture, and does not return to its position after dislocation, until it is accustomed to returning, then it dislocates from a small movement that occurs as we have already testified, then you must first reduce the dislocation. Then the patient shall be laid on their back, or on their healthy side. Then lift the skin that is in the inner titillum towards the top with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then having a cautery with two prongs of fire. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin, until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes a cauterization is made with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the figure of the cauterization is then of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the fineness of the thread.
And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added to this manner, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place on the cautery pounded leeks with salt. Then cause the infirm person to adhere to stillness, so that the limb does not move at any time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upward, and rarely does it occur thus, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
When there are cold and numerous moistures in the stomach, until they draw it away from its disposition, and phlegms multiply within it, and constant methods of treatment do not help, then it is necessary that the sick person be laid on their back, and extend their legs, and their hands. Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery beneath the breast, the size of one finger's breadth with a cautery blade, and two cauteries below, on either side of the first cautery, until the shape of the cauteries forms a triangle. And elongate them [the cauteries] between each other so they do not join, when they will produce pus.
And the depth of the cautery should be the thickness of two-thirds of the skin.
And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form, without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach, according to this form, let the cautery by which this is done be one according to the form of a circle, according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it for him who is terrified by this cautery; and it is as if one marks a point on the stomach according to the size that one desires with ink; then cauterize it with a cautery of the point; then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
On the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
When pain in the liver occurs from cold and moisture, or from thick wind, until it departs from its natural complexion by the departure of superfluous matter, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not help him: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his neck, and that three cauteries be marked with ink according to this figure, and the same size on the liver below the hypochondria, where the human elbow reaches; and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
And let the quantity of what is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it not added; and let the patient be standing on his feet.
If however he is not standing, then let him lie down, having now extended his legs and raised his arms.
This is the form of the cautery.
And it is possible for you, to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And guard yourself, lest you proceed too far in the cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, wherefore the entire body is burned, and it reaches the intestines; because the skin there is delicate, know this therefore.
Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
When discharge occurs, and you wish to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, it afflicts the sick person with pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with the pain is a sharp vehemence: and you see now that the treatment has fatigued its physicians.
Therefore, the sick person must lie on their back on a pillow. Then mark the location of the abscess with a marking ink; then apply a cautery heated like a ray. And this is its form. And cauterize with it one cautery, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the pus, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for discharges until it is healed.
And one should not use this type of cautery unless the one who studies the art of medicine has practiced it, and through whose hands such illnesses have come with experience several times: for only then should he dare to undertake such an operation.
But truly, to leave it alone is better for me.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Pleuresy.
The ancients said that a cautery with aristolochia roots should be used for a cold pleurisy in this manner. And it is, that you should receive from the dry long roots of aristolochia, one root longer than the others, which is found in it, and let it be as thick as a finger. Then immerse it in oil, and light it in fire. Then cauterize with one cautery at the point where the fork joins the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping down on the part beneath the chin.
And with two cauteries also on that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backward; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And with three cauteries from the back: one on that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And you should not compress your hand with the cautery, rather it should be in plain view, smelling the skin.
And some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron like a rod; and they ignite it, and insert it into that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess itself, and pus comes out; as we said regarding liver abscess.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the spleen, Chapter XXXII.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, with what we said about treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment is of no use, then the cautery is on it according to three methods, which are all correct.
One of which is to make three cauteries, or four, by drawing a line along the length of the spleen, according to the figure of the liver cauteries, whose figure preceded.
And let there be between each cautery a quantity equal to the thickness of a finger, or more or less.
And let the method of the cautery be, as we said, in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the infirm person lie supine on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you heat the cautery having two prongs, which we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus; and raise the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the left elbow of the infirm person reaches; and let your elevation of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them; then withdraw the cautery; therefore four cauteries are made.
And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then treat the cautery after you let it discharge pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than all the preceding treatments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in dropsy.
The cautery does not fall upon dropsy unless properly applied.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have described in the division, and the treatment does not benefit, then you should cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery on the stomach, and another cautery on the liver, and one cautery on the spleen, and two cauteries on the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it emits pus for a long time.
And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery with it; for it is necessary that two intentions gather for him: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, according to its previous form; and the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Feet and Legs.
When abscesses occur in a dropsy patient, and are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the area between the auricular and annular [bones]; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not turn it; then raise your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this form.
Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the blade-end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and make two cauteries on each thigh; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water sweats out from it; then treat it with the rest of what we have said.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in abdominal disorders.
Chapter XXXV.
When there is an abdominal disorder caused by cold and dampness, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with methods of cure, and is not healed; and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of great power, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, according to what has preceded in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery, and with four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle clavus cautery; and with a large cautery on the alcatin above the alhosos, or with two cauteries.
And if you see excessive moisture, and the sick person tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the breastbone, and with a cautery on each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moisture, and are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower spine of the back, slightly triangularly under the almeidati, and with a cautery under the navel, as if with two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming abscessed, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what went before; and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a cautery iron; and leave the cautery open for some time; then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise althelul, then heat the cautery that is like a ray. Then introduce the heated cautery into the excised althelul: and with the end of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do it once, or twice.
If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with the cautery according to what we have recounted. Then treat them with that which benefits them from ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on the alcatin, it is more effective in helping.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter XXXVIII.
When the patient does not obey the incision and operation that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery.
When therefore a fistula occurs in someone, and becomes chronic, pus runs from it, and corrupt humors. Therefore it is fitting that you probe it with a fine probe. Then ascertain the depth of it with the probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray. Then introduce the heated cautery into the fistula itself and the amount in which the cautery entered.
And repeatedly apply the cautery to it, until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
And beware of burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a major vein; or if the fistula goes to the bladder, or the body of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you judge that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it is healed.
If, however, the place is sealed, and the matter is cut away from it, and remains like this for a long time, then you should know that it is now completely healed.
And if matter is not cut away from it, then you should know that it is penetrating, or a corrupt bone is within it, or something like that from those [sources], whose mention will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from a large wind, and it is lessened because of that infirmity, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the almethen, over the kidneys themselves, cauterizing over each kidney with a clauili cautery, the mention of which preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time on the same almeidan. Therefore three lines will come. Therefore the last will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and dampness, so that the afflicted person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic comb begin. Cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the summit, and another from its left.  Let the length of each cauterization along the side be equal to the size of a thumb's node; and cauterize with a cautery of the lower back, or with two cauteries if that one is insufficient. Let this be in accordance with the preceding cautery's closure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb.
When cold and dampness affect the womb, preventing conception, corrupting her menses, delaying their expulsion, and causing pain upon their arrival, then three cauteries should be applied around the navel, as was described in the cauterization of the bladder, and one cautery above the lower back, or two cauteries.  And let this cautery be the closing cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
When mucous humors discharge into the anus, causing it to depart from its place, and the sign of this is that one leg is prolonged over the other when they are compared together, and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the affected area over the anus itself with a similar circular cautery, after you mark it with ink around its perimeter as it revolves, so that the anus falls in the middle of the circle.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery, and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and dampness, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic, then it is necessary to relieve the patient of the gross humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar ones. Then cauterize it.
And the method of cautery in it is according to two methods: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cautery with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is to cauterize over the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form. And make them a good or bad depth. And let the space that is between each cautery be of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes however, cautery is made in the middle over the head of the hip itself. Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: so that there may be a circle containing the entire hip.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery in Sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If however it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, over the place to which the infirm person there points, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the shin four fingers to the wild part for a short time: and let the cautery be a knife-like one.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
If the infirm person indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a prick cautery, three, or four, or more, if it requires that.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee toward the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations, that you not proceed with the cautery to the point of burning the nerve, or a large artery, and thereby inflicting upon the infirm a bad harm or contraction.
And indeed I have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in the cauterization, and the leg swelled up, until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole was perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then the belly dissolved, and death followed after that.
If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
And some wise men said on the cauterization of the buttock, of which this is the method of cautery. Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date seed, or a little less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space that is between every cautery be by the amount of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
Then let it be heated in fire until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the box of the buttock of the sick man reclining on his healthy side. Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at one time.
Then leave him for three days. Afterwards apply plasters with butter, and leave the wound open for many days. Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, with this kind of cautery, O sons, we have used it little, because of the terror of its appearance, and because we have found few who can endure it.
However, it is a good cautery for one who endures it, and who finds its place with it.
A cautery, however, is with burning medicines, so that you make two samia having a perforated armilla, into which the hinge of its door descends, of bronze or iron, the length of a wall, whose height they shall have two knots, or like them.
And let the space between each be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above, and let that which contains them be joined together, in this manner.
Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick man lying on his healthy side. And press your hand upon the box of ashes firmly. Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated with fire for a short time, and hold it for the amount of an hour's time.  And let the sick man endure its stinging and its burning, for he finds the stinging like fire, until the stinging subsides.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wash away the hot water from the entire ash with sweet water; then leave it for three days.
And place butter upon it, until the blackness of the burning is removed; and leave it for a number of days, and pus will run from it. For it is the ultimate in aid.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the hip, or leg: make a poultice on it that contains water, as you did on the ash equally.
And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, both of one part: grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with one small hole, according to the quantity that the radius will enter: and place another glazed pot under the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime from sweet water, which submerges both by a finger: after which you compress them with your hand with a good compression: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glazed pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over other lime; and strain, until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many surgical operations and in the cauterization of other limbs. Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And from medicines, with which the anchas are cauterized, also such as tessie, and honey of anacardi, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen, indeed, narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from ancient times, by which the pain of the ancha and the sciatic vein was cured; and he magnified its effectiveness greatly. And he said that he did not need any other treatment, and that he was healed in one instance, until he recounted that perhaps he had entered a bath and exited it already healed.
And it is to be taken from green seitaragi; and if green is not found, let dry, fresh, be taken; and let it be ground much with some fat, and let it be placed over the ancha, where the pain is, or the leg, or the thigh; and let it be bound, and let it be left for the quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the sick person feels a soothing of the burning. Then introduce him into a bath.
When therefore his body is made moist, introduce him into a bed. For the pain recedes, and it is healed.
And know that it is not fitting for anyone to use a cautery with these medicines, unless after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who also said that goat dung, when cauterized with it a sciatic vein, is beneficial to it: and the cautery is made in this way. Let wool be taken, and soaked in old oil, and placed upon the deep place, which is between the toe and the heel, and is nearer to the heel.
Then take dry goat dung, and inflame it in fire, until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it upon the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished. Then repeat it. Therefore do not cease to do this, until the sensation reaches the middle of the sore, and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinum cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of pain in the back.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from an accident, or from a blow, or from an evacuation of superfluous matter, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and damp matter: and indeed cautery does not apply, except in this one kind, which occurs from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul pills, and similar things, let three lines be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the area itself, after making marks with ink on each line with five cauteries, or more according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the patient's strength: and let the cauterization be made with a cautery point.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries with a medial cautery blade, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the beginning stages of a hunchback.
This illness often happens to young children.
And the sign of its beginning in children is: that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon lifting and movement; and you find in the last vertebra of the back and its joints that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cauterium that is circular according to this shape.
And let the cauterium take hold over the entire area of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize in a circle of the vertebra with a pointed cauterium, make two or three lines; and let the points be close together.
Then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware, that you do not apply the cauterium to the hump which arises in spasm of the nerve.
On the method of cauterization in gout and joint pains.
When pains in the joints are from cold humors that flow to any part of the body, and when pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call that gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
And it is, that one should cauterize it after evacuation, in a circuit of the foot's joint, with many cauteries, and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
And if you need to puncture the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries, on all sides, with this same claviform cautery.
If however more of this cautery is necessary for you, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said concerning cauteries in its chapter.
If, however, the pains are only in the hands, then prick the points around the foci, as two lines revolve.
If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then prick them, over each knot, and over the palm of the hand.
If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not remove the sick person from a good regimen, from the taking of medicines. For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is expelled, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
Concerning the manner of cauterization in Ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine, or the spermatic cord, descends to the testicle, and it is beginning to draw near: then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person to diminish his food intake in his daily diet. And let him use laxatives, so that the excrement may descend from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands upon his back: and instruct him to hold his breath, until it emerges, or the spermatic cord, or the intestine, appears.
Then, reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink beneath the rupture, above the pubic bone, with a sign whose extremity resembles half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then, cauterize with fire, of which this is the shape, until it turns white and throws off sparks. Then reduce the intestine, or the spermatic cord, to its cavity. Then let the attendant place his hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant over his legs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery upon that mark, your hand holding the cautery upright. And hold it until you meet the opening with it; or repeat with it another time, if you have not met the opening with it in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and death or great harm befall the sick person through it.
And know that when you do not meet the opening with the cautery, your operation is not successful.
And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be thin, according to their size.
Then treat with the remaining ointments until it is healed.
And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you provide sustenance for the duration of his treatment, which will soothe his stomach, so that the intestines do not exit during straining and defecation.
Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
And let him be reduced in labor, and in repletion of food and drink, and in loud voices.
For when he uses this regimen, he is thus healed with complete healing.
And I will speak of the treatment of Ruptures with incision in his chapter.
However, when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and the force is such that they should not be added to, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be thus a third of it. Then treat him with what we have said, and it will not be added to.
And now some of the first have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width at the upper side of the rupture, and another line at the lower. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery-iron.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
Concerning the method of cauterization in pains from a fall or a blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When, in certain limbs, pain occurs from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of every limb be a cautery according to its size, and its own smallness, and its weakness, and its own strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it is healed from the first cautery, it is well. If not, then repeat the cautery upon it.
Because it is customary for these pains to move from one limb to that which is near it. Therefore it is necessary to pursue them with cautery, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly helped by cautery. And especially the type of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, consider the power of cauterization itself.
If, therefore, the leprosy is unrelenting, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it neither recedes nor stands still; and you fear that the corruption may encompass his entire constitution; then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the known head, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind above the nape of the neck.
And hold your hand with the cautery for a little while, until it imprints a small impression on the bone, and the bark comes away from it: so that the expulsion of thick vapors from it may be relieved, and cauterize the spleen itself with cautery, according to what preceded.
But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient, and appears clearly; then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries that we mentioned for the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two jaws, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the buttocks near the tailbone, and one above it, on the very back of the buttocks; and two on the hips: that is, one on each hip, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of his chest; and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers of his hands and feet; and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the joints of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the heel, so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes a cautery is applied to the sternum, and another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more help and benefit it provides.
And know that the sick person does not experience pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
And there should be cauteries of different sizes, large and small, according to the members and joints, in accordance with the variety of instruments that have gone before.
Then treat the cautery with flour of herbs and honey, and with other remedies, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a state of numbness.
When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb, whether large or small.
And let your cautery enter the thickness of the skin a little. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes it is cauterized for some numbness that happens to the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit points of the nerves that move that limb, and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume upon it unless he is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exit points of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter LI.
When Albaras is old and no medicinal remedies are of benefit, then cauterize above it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of herb, and lentils with rose oil, and arnogloss leaves, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood; of each, one part; mix these together, and spread them on a cloth, and apply to the site until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, just as it revolves.
However, the wise said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
However, it does not seem right to me, because I fear it will ulcerate, and I have already seen that happen several times.
And it is more correct that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess causing it, or because of the patient's age, when they are feeble with little blood, or because of the time and need to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing. Then leave it. For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you want a perforation of it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the patient, so that the course may be eased by purulent matter.
Then care for it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corroding evil.
Chapter LIII.
Corrosion is nothing but a corruption in a limb that wanders and corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see a corroding thing in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then apply many cauteries with fire, small and large iron cauteries, according to what suits the place where the corrosion is.
Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Then leave it for three days, and place on the cauterized areas ground sulfur with oil, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then again cauterize that which remains of the corrupted areas.
And it is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine by corroding. For it itself arises in place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker benefit; and I have already spoken of its cauterization with sharp medicine in division; therefore take it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in warts and corns.
Chapter LV.
This ailment frequently occurs in the lower parts of the feet, and it is a thick, filtered substance that harms the foot.
And cautery in them is indeed according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for cautery with fire, you should heat a concave cautery resembling a vulture's wing, made of iron, according to the size of the corn encompassing it on all sides, and with thin edges.
Then place it, heated, upon the corn. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the corn, until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn, and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus. Then plaster it with crushed wild herbs and salt, and leave the plaster upon it overnight. For it will be rooted out from its roots.
Then treat the place with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
If they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery with hot water to them.  And it is as if you take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather, and place it on the corn or whitlow. Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula; hold your hand and rotate it with the pressure of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the cannula is impressed on the root of the corn, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the corn. And let the sick person wait a while on the soaking from the hot water for an hour.
Then dismiss him, for the corn is rooted out with its roots.
Do this to them one by one, until you have dealt with all of them on the body.
Then treat them after they are rooted out, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Tremor.
When tremor occurs in someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or otherwise, then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries, or five, above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on his chest with a cautery, and on his stomach with a cautery.
For tremor subsides with the cautery of olive oil, and the cure of the cold sickness hastens.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes foul things, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body from corrupted gross matter.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary first that every pustule on the head be cauterized with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip is heated with fire. Or with the root of long aristolochia. Or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way, and they do not increase; and the superfluity causing them is broken, and they heal from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Often there is a flow of blood from an artery that has been cut in a wound, which happens externally, or in an incision of an abscess, or a cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it is difficult to stop it.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing escapes from it.
Then put small olive-shaped cauteries, and many large ones, in the fire: and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on the vein, after you quickly remove your finger, and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
If it escapes when you lift your finger from the artery's opening, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries prepared in the fire.
Therefore do not cease to do this with one after another until the blood is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that another harm comes upon the sick person.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods. Or with a cautery, as we said. Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off. Or it is tied with a strong ligature. Or medicines of a nature to cut off the blood are placed upon it, and it is bound with a suitable constricting pad.
However, whoever administers its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or application of burning substances, and similar things, does not truly benefit it, except rarely.
If, however, this happens to someone, and a physician is not present for them, nor medicine: then they should begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and its constriction strongly, until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery. And the finger is not to be removed, from above it with very cold water, constantly, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and is cut off.
And meanwhile let him consider what it needs from cauterization, or from medicine.
Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already stated in the First Chapter, every ailment in which it is fitting to use cauterization with fire and burning medicine, and the occasions for it, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
And I placed there chapters from head to foot.
And I shall proceed in this chapter by the same path, so that the seeker may have his question alleviated.
And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, my children, to know that in this chapter there is the terror which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, since in the operation which is in this chapter, often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or the incision over an abscess, or the opening of an exit, or the healing of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or the incision over a stone, and similar to these: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that which causes hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes the ways of men with the ways of illnesses befall you in this art. For among them is he who is angry with his illness, and death is slight to him; because of the intensity he finds in his illness and its length of malice. And with illness is fear that signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his tithe and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose method is such. And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your rapacity. And do not presume upon anything of it unless after certain knowledge, which verifies to you that to which praiseworthy succession has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your sick people, prognosis and indication of that to which health befittingly belongs.
For in that is help for you concerning the acquisition of fame and glory, and of memory and praise.
May God, O children, inspire you with his understanding, and may he not remove from you direction and inspiration; for it is in his hand.
And I have indeed arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, just as preceded in the Chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that your seeking of it may be alleviated, and what you need.
Concerning the treatment of Water which gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this ailment frequently happens to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
And sometimes it also occurs from a hidden cause that is not known.
And I myself have not seen this illness in any but children, and death has approached all whom I saw afflicted by it; therefore, it seemed to me to omit treatment for it.
And I myself have seen one child among them whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger each day, until it could not sit upon itself, due to the magnitude of its head, and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, indeed, either collects between the skin and the bone, or collects under the bone above the surface.
And if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then one should make a single fissure in the middle of the head, in width, and the fissure's length should be approximately two digits, until the moisture flows out.
And this is the form of a lancet.
If, therefore, the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place two fissures, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and water is pressed out when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and that is not hidden from you, then you should make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this method.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture. Then bind the fissures with cloths and bandages. Then apply a poultice of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with splints and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equality. And feed the infirm person with all dry foods of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and collection of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the infirm person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When cataracts occur to someone in the eyes or the chest, and it becomes chronic, and the treatment of medicines does not benefit: then a more ultimate treatment is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the infirm person shave his head. Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear. Then let the infirm person bind his neck with any cloth of his. Then consider where the vein beats. And the places of both are the places which are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men.
Then mark with ink above each: and incise each with a scalpel on both sides, the incision reaching the bone: and let it be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery and cut it upward with the incision.
And the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.
For when a vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, leaping to the interior with frequent jumps.
If however the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth. Then mark with ink, and split until the mouth.
And that which it is necessary to discharge from the blood is VI ounces, and perhaps you discharge from it more or less. All of it according to the quantity that appears to you from the weakness of the infirm and the filling of his artery.
Then consider the wound. Then if anything remains at the mouth from the sifac, then cut it, lest a hot abscess occur: then bind the wound with linen bandages.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic hemicrania, or acute catarrhs because of acrid humours, and heat in the temporal muscles, or chronic, severe, and similar ailments: and is treated with the methods of medical care, and it does not help: then we are experienced in these illnesses in the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described.
And the method of operation in extracting them is that the infirm person should shave the hair that is on the temples, and direct himself toward the artery appearing in the temple. For it indeed shows itself to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by the intensity of cold.
If it is hidden from you, then let the infirm person tie his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth. Or steam the place with hot water, until it appears to you by manifest appearance. Then take the spatula, which I formed a little while ago. Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery. Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards until you pull it out of the skin, and make it escape from the tunics that are under it from every side.
If however the artery is fine: then wrap it with the end of the hook. Then cut a part from it according to the amount by which its ends will be elongated and contracted, and so that no flow of blood occurs. For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend completely.
Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk or of al-hohod cords, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the wound's consolidation, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then cut away the excess that is between the two ligatures. Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same operation.
And it is a better operation, unless the sick person has a fever, or is of a hot temperament. Because cauterization is from among those things which help to end moistures. Therefore it is a better aid.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old cotton: and pads made properly should be placed on it.
And after the removal, treat with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
If, however, during the operation, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to cauterize it, or to fill the place with zegi; and bind your hand until the blood stops. If none of those is present for you, then place your finger on the spot until the blood congeals. And embrocate the place with water of great cold, until the sharpness subsides, and bind it as necessary.
And since it is easier and less laborious to extract an artery, cauterize the vein with this cautery that has two blades; and the sharpness of the two blades should be similar to an almond. However, they are of much less sharpness than two blades. For if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold affects both quickly, and do not cut the flesh with speed. Therefore, since there is a slight thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held within them, and the flesh is cut quickly; with this, then, the work is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
And this is the form of cautery.
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink; and place both heated strongly, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places, so that the distance between its extremities is extended. For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
Chapter IV.
Concerning the treatment of acute, persistent lacrimal discharge from the eyes.
When the tears are constant, and their flow is from the veins that are on the outer skull; and no medicinal treatment with medicines avails in them; and you see the face of the sick person already red, and he feels in his forehead a crawling sensation, like the crawling of ants; and his eyes are thinned, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with corrosion; and his eyelids are inflamed from the acuteness of the tears; then the ancients needed this operation in their treatment of them, and they named that treatment, "with the Knife.
And it is, that you order the sick person to shave the hairs that are on his forehead. Then make three equally spaced incisions along the length of the forehead; and let the length of each incision be about two fingers; and let one incision be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second a little to the side of the temples' movement, and the third on the other side; and be cautious not to cut the arteries that are on either side; and keep your hand away from the line of the two jawbones, and let the distance of each incision be the amount of three joined fingers; and let you have a piece of prepared sponge, or many dried cloths, with which you dry the blood.
Then introduce a spatula with two sharp ends, whose form is as follows. From the incision that is on the side of the temple, up to the second incision; and scrape with it the entire skin that is between the two incisions, as if it were over a bone. Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision. Then withdraw this spatula, and introduce into the first incision another instrument, called a sharp scalpel, with one side smooth, not sharp, on the other side. And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes; except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after an equal quantity of blood has run out, express the places from the clots of coagulated blood.
Then place in every fissure a linen cloth from old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar. And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer much infusion with lukewarm water. Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other remedies with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
Chapter V.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs befall someone, and you see their eyes thinned, small, and their sight already weakened, and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, harmful pain deep within the head, and sneezing follows: then understand from these occurrences that these matters, and catarrhs, do not arise except from many veins.
And the better treatment for them is this. And it is that you should instruct the sick person to shave his forehead. Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or a little further along the width, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple.  Let the incision reach to the bone, and move your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing, until the bone is exposed, and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cloth, or with flax linen strips. Then bind them from above with pads, and soak the pads with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you have removed it, and see that the hot abscess is already diminishing, then it is necessary to rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow, such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Chapter VI.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water, vinegar, and the like; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone from among those which do not adhere nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you then see the stone, then instill into the ear some violet oil, or sesame oil. Then administer its extraction, and make them sneeze with the condiment, and close the nostrils at the advent of the sneeze, after you place around the ear pieces of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upward.
For often it exits with this treatment.
If, however, it does not exit, then administer its extraction with a gesti, that is, with slender pincers; whose shape is this.
If, therefore, it exits with the gesti, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a slender, single-pronged hook.
If, therefore, it does not exit through that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole deeply, and fill that which is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no way for wind except through the tube; then extract it with your suction with strong pulling.
For many times it exits with that which we have narrated. If, however, it does not exit in this manner, then take a small amount of helkalimbat, or of viscus, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, and place it at the end of the radius after you have wrapped a suitable piece of cloth around it; then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If, therefore, it does not exit with all that we have narrated, then hurry to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of the incision is, that a weak phlebotomist first in the cephalic vein: and extract from it blood according to the measure of his strength. Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near his fat in the depressed area: and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you.
Then close the incision with your skill quickly, and treat it until it is healed.
If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If however it does not yield to you for exit, then take a thin, slender spatula, according to this form.
And administer with it the excision of that kind of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that the grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it in many fragments; then extract them with hooks, or with a fine forceps, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is alleviated.
However, for water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the weak person to use sneezing with a condiment at first; and already he has filled his ear with some old cotton; and he is lying on that ear in which there is water. If therefore it emerges through it, it is good.
And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire for a short time, and let the weak person insert one of them into the hole of his ear; and let him jump on one of his feet from that side, and strike with another stone the stone that is in the ear. Therefore, he shall not cease to do that with stone and stone until all the water emerges.
And now water emerges thus, so that you take one from papyrus, or from a reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and you set fire to the other end with fire, until most of it is burned. Then again a different reed, and do that many times, until all the water emerges; and extract it with a cannula, according to that which was previously stated concerning the stone.
In the extraction of an animal that has entered it, if it is of small body, such as a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those which are held in the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you examine the ear in the sun. If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with thin hooks.
If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, which has this shape, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top: and insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates; then suck with it a strong suction. Do that many times, until all the worms come out.
If, however, they do not yield to you for exit, then coat the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the section on stones.
If they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already tested for killing worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring of oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. As you see, make it from silver, or bronze, narrowed below, in which there is a small opening, wider above.
Let the part that presses, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made from bronze properly. And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap cotton around its end with a proper wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish, into the cannula; and let the cannula be in the ear; then insert the rod with the cotton on top, and express it with your hand by a moderate pressure, until the oil is driven into the concavity of the hearing, and the patient feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear, let it be warmed a little with fire; and beware that the distilled substance in it is not too cold; for medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter VII.
Concerning the treatment of sudden ear blockage.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And sometimes blockage of the ear canal occurs in some people from a wound or a growth of flesh in it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear opening, and is not visible; and sometimes it occurs near the outer part of the opening, and is visible.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which the sight does not encompass, is, in many cases, difficult to cure.
And in that which is visible, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look at it; then, if you see the blockage appearing, open it with a fine spatula, whose shape is as follows, that is, that one end has a small width, one part of which is pointed; and the rest of the spatula has two smooth sides, so that it does not harm the ear.
If, therefore, the blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then grasp it with a fine hook, and cut it out with gentle force, until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth reed, and heat it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If, therefore, you feel the blockage with the patient's difficulty hearing, try to open it gently, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place a bandage on the ear, according to the size of the opening you have made, wrapped in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days, until you are sure of the wound's healing.
Or take a bandage, and soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle powdered zegi on it, and use it.
If you see that the ear has already become abscessed, then it is necessary to remove the bandage, and apply another bandage wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, bleeding occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place them on the ear; and use the remaining treatment, which stops bleeding, as described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of Altheli of the eyelids.
Chapter VIII.
These Altheli that occur in the eyelids are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should grasp them with tweezers or with a hook, and cut them with a spatula from their roots. Then place powdered zegi over the area.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after incision. For they often return when something remains from their roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs in the eyelids that resembles a granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of it is called a granulation: and it is a collection of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore the operation on them is, that you should consider then, if it is a granulation proceeding from that which appears on the eyelid, and moves in every direction, and its removal is easy.
Therefore make a fissure over it along its width. Then scrape it from every side with ease until it is removed. Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
However, if its removal is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the patient in some way.
If the fissure is large, then bring it together with stitches and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it. For ointment restores it and causes it to flesh over.
And if the granulation is sloping inwards towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the granulation with a hook; moreover, you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is elongated by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the granulation, with salt water; and treat the place with that which causes fleshing, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the eyelashes.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is a fat that is produced in the tissues of the upper eyelid; and it mostly occurs in children.  It weighs down their eyes, and they have catarrhs in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them, and on account of this you see them always lying on their faces, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are wet, which now the swelling has covered.  And indeed the prominent Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And the method of its treatment is that the sick person should place his head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare a bandage on it, and make a circle from that bandage according to the amount that Axirnath occupies on all sides. Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, incisions along its width, and let the incision not be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in the depths.
Or it is necessary to cut through the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath, for in many ways Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the shape of a white fat lump.
Therefore, pull it out with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers on the outside; and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed; and beware, lest you add to the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet and injure it.
If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should add a little to the incision with ease, until Axirnath proceeds. Then extract it, as we have said.
Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind it with bandages.
And some men grind salt and place it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remained of the moisture liquefies.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If however a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Concerning the methods for Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whence it happens that it wrinkles improperly.
Chapter XI.
When additional hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural hair course, and grow old, then they harm the eye, and cause conditions of illness, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and cloudiness, until it becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire. Or with a sharp medicine, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery. Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture. Or by tubes, according to what I will say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom. Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good. And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow; and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a rod.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula sliding from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place a small cushion of cotton, or cloth, under the eyelid; then mark the eyelid with ink, that it may be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that it be shaped according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it varies in humans.
For among them is one who needs a large amount of eyelid to be cut, according to the amount softened by the eyelid.
Then, with a spatula, find the two lines you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the fissure be close to the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a ray.
Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin. Then scrape it all off. Then bring together the two edges with a needle and fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and make whatever excess thread remains adhere to the two eyebrows, with certain adhesive substances if you wish to do so; and if not, do not worry about it.
Then leave the suture and threads until three or four days; afterwards, treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture and treat it with that which dries and contracts it. For the eyelid is raised by the sealing and bringing together of the wound; but it will be better.
The ancients taught this method of treatment.
However, there is care for the sick person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure that is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have recounted.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks, or grouped together, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equal incision.
If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which is a thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then raise your hand with equal elevation, and raise the skin upon which the mark is made, as we have recounted.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
If indeed a boil occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that boil with cauterium, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid as well, that its hairs turn.
Therefore, it is necessary that you use what we said in the incision: but the suture is more artificial in both. Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and split the fissure which is within, according to what I have described. Then make two canes, or two thin pieces of wood, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of the spatula; and you have already incised at the ends of each on both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully apply each one to the excess of the eyelid, and bind the two canes firmly together on both sides, and leave it for a few days. For the tight skin will die, and darken, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. Then care for it until it is healed.
When it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two canes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
Chapter XII.
Concerning the raising of prickling hairs in the eye with a needle.
The operation in that is, that you should take a slender needle, and introduce into it a fine, smooth silk thread. Then tie its ends together, and make very small knots on each side: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place another fine thread underneath it in Alinxotati, briefly, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the sick person place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation may be revealed; because it is a subtle or minute operation.
Then introduce the needle with alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair upward through the alinxotati: and introduce that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural hair.
However, if the alinxotati is pulled out, and the hair does not emerge with it: you shall pull the alinxotati downward, with the thread that you have placed within it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with the eye's vision; for then you shall pull the alinxotati and the thread: and remove both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and raise it with it; or leave it until it lengthens after a time, and then raise it.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental, therefore, it arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to these.
And the method of treatment in it is that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its edges, and place on that which is between them a linen bandage, and tie it, until it is healed.
And it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things which dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather, use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek; and embrocate with water in which marshmallow, flaxseed, have been cooked; and with the unguent dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some of the oils; and wrap it with a bandage, and treat it with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all your ingenuity so that it does not consolidate according to the form which it was in the beginning.
And this operation, which we have described, is only a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the shape of the place does not return to what it was entirely.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati, which occurs below, is the one truly called Alxatrati. And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental one results from a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is that you should take a needle, on which there is a double thread, and you should dip it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula. If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a radius, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them: until when they are joined together the shape of them becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh, by the quantity that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid. Then join the separated parts: sew it with a wool thread.
Then treat them with what we said, concerning softening medicines, and bandages, until they heal.
And if a laceration happens from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even according to what has preceded. Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we said.
And the summary of the treatment for Alxatra, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Alxatra.
For indeed it has many varieties of form: and the skillful craftsman prepares an invention in whatever way possible for it, until he causes the figure to return to its natural form, or nearly so, and the infirm person himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
Chapter XV.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Sometimes this consolidation happens in many people, so that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore, you should insert the end of a probe under the eyelid and lift it upwards; or extend it with a hook.  Then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharp, but somewhat blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the procedure, and the spatula is removed without injuring the eye with its sharpness. Your incision should be as if you were gently scraping away the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salty water into the eye, washing it with the water; or distill it into it from a sieve made from dissolved zinc with water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with linen strips; and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after three days use a sieve, and with consolidants, until healed.
Concerning the incision of the toenail and the fleshy prominence of the tear ducts.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the toenail is according to two ways. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to hard, fine sinew. Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, it is severed, and the hook does not fix in it.
And both types do not begin, unless from the greater tear duct, until it gradually goes, until it covers the sight, and hinders light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operation in its incision is: that the weak person should place his head in your lap. Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand. Then gather the nail with a hook of little duplication, and extend it upward. Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or an ox, or a cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the tip of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upward: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair until its end.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a delicate spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear tissue, so that a continuous flow of tears does not occur from its incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we said. Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, whose form is this.
And beware that the spatula does not touch the corneal membrane, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is pierced.
Then, after the incision, place some crushed salt, or a poultice made from ziniar, on the eye, and leave it until the next day. Then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this kind of nail is treated many times with remedies, and is healed as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye, and take a fine, gentle, weakly sharpened spatula, according to this form. And scrape the nail from above with precision. If you see that it becomes thinner and breaks, and the scraping impresses it, then distill from your hour glass into the eye a sief made from ziniar, or from red sief, or crushed salt: and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the operation on it, until the whole of it is removed. Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye; then leave it, and treat the abscess until it heals.
Then repeat the operation on it with scraping, until it heals.
However, if a fleshy prominence of the tear duct is causing great harm to the eye, suspend it with a hook and cut away part of it; and do not make the incision too deep, so that the tear ducts are not damaged.
Then instill into the tear duct a red, or ziniari-made, liquid, until it heals.
Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh grown in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes in some people's eyes, red flesh grows, either compounded or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids, and perhaps even turns the eyelids outward; and it resembles a rose hip.
And the treatment in it is also that the sick person should place his head in your lap. Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with one forceps, or a similar instrument.
Then cut into the flesh first, until all of it is finished with the scalpel. And be careful of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation; and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a spatula, such as we described in the incision of a nail, or with small shears, with which asebel is collected, according to the form it will take after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is complete, and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distil into it a red powder, and similar medicines that corrode; and place over the eye, externally, a cloth with egg white; so that it is safeguarded from a hot abscess.
If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye, and treat it with whatever soothes the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh that occurs in the eye of this sort.
However, it is necessary that you avoid treating any weak eye by a natural or accidental route, by operating with iron, and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that the member is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII.
Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and hinder the eye's operation of seeing; and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong, and there is no illness in it besides the Sebel; then collect its Sebel.
And it is that you should instruct the sick person to place their head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be a fine double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded on a single body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors with delicacy, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and they dissolve; and beware lest you injure the eye with the tips of the scissors.
And let your operation be in the midday sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not strike anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then distill into the eye a green or red syr, so that with its sharpness it corrodes whatever remains of the scab.
However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the eye's pain, and leave it for a few days until its pain subsides, and is secured from a hot abscess; then repeat on it according to the same method, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of a fractured nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call a fistula, which you treat with a cautery or with a burning sharp medicine, according to its preceding description.
And if it does not heal, then there is no remedy for it, unless you lance the abscess near its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus from it, until the bone is exposed.
When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
And it is called a rough head.
Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like an azir, that is, pointed with the filing of a file, or with the fine point of an aliskilfer: and place it on the diseased place of the bone.
Then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh grows on it, and the course of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become an abscess, and no accident happens to it: then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no cure for it, unless to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
And it is, that you expose the bone with an instrument or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone has been exposed, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular; and let its wood be a tapering pyramid to the tip, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand away from the eye a little. Then revolve your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the sick person feels it: through this, that he finds air escaping from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore, then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I have taught you.
When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens, then the matter which was flowing outwards returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter for the sick person.
Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the Eye.
Chapter XX.
When the eye protrudes completely, and no harm or diminution occurs in the vision, then you should release the patient, then bleed him, afterwards apply cupping to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then apply a liniment to the eye made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla. Then cover the eye from above with a plaster with many small bandages.
And the way of the small bandages is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth is folded over four times; make many of them; then place them one over another, according to the amount the eye needs; then bind them with a strong bandage.
And repeat the cupping with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping, and leave the eye bound day and night.
However, if the bandage softens again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye now returned to the white tunic, it is good; and if not, then apply the plaster again, and the bandages, and the binding, and the cupping, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the white tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the white tunic, then it protrudes and comes out beyond the eyelids like a grain of the white tunic, and it disfigures the appearance of the person on account of it, and the wish is to incise it; then the procedure for it is, as I describe: and it is, that you introduce a needle into the root of the white tunic from the lower to the upper part.
Then introduce another needle, on which there is a double thread from the tear duct side, and have it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the white tunic in the circumference of the needle; and tighten it greatly.
Then withdraw the needle, and place on the eye wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread falls with the white tunic.
Then care for the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the white tunic is tightened from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Then pierce it with a fine spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and let the white moisture run, and let the eye descend, and immediately enter [the wound]; then tighten it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Chapter XXII.
This ailment, called Alcomnat, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not the eye itself.
And the method of operation in it is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Then take his head with your hands by both sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of his eyes. Then let it be fixed, and do not let it descend, and let the light be cleared: and let the sick person see things as he saw them before: and if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and with it split the corneal membrane slightly at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, in the crown, until pus exits.
When it therefore exits, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the remaining treatment, until he is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water that descends in the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already discussed the types of water in division, and what is suitable for piercing, the speaker explaining and setting forth; then take that same thing according to health.
Then, therefore, it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tightly restrain it; then, with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye, or with your left hand, if the eye is the right, press the eyelid of his eye.
Then take an almond with your right hand, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the tip of the almond near the crown, through the thickness of a ray, on the apparent white of the eye, the smaller tear; then push the almond with force, and you will rotate your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you will feel that the almond has now reached the empty space.
And it is necessary that the measure of the almond's journey to the depth be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye. For you will see them in the pupil itself, by means of the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the almond to the place where the water is. Then press it below, one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Then rest a little. If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almond emerges.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend, then extract the almond with ease, and you turn your hand gradually.
Then dissolve some of the clear gem salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then place over the eye a whole piece of lint, or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bandage the sound eye with it.
We, and those of our time, place crushed cumin with egg white on it.
If the almond does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from humans whose eye is very hard, then you should take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Therefore, scrape with it only the conjunctiva itself, and do not place your hand in the opening; and it is only to make a subtle path to the almond's place.
Then introduce the almond, according to what we said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare a properly made bedchamber for the sick person, in which he shall sleep on his back in a dark room; and prohibit all movements and coughing; and place his food that which eases his nature; and let him not move his head to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his sight; and make him see things. Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And it should not be done at the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it should be deferred; because water ascends rapidly through forceful looking.
However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you loosen the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which calms the abscess until it is calmed; then free its sight, and place over its face an oral thing by which its sight is governed for a few days, while he remains in that dark room.
Then let him emerge from the house gradually, and converse in his houses.
And know that in the zaltea a pupil is not excused from sight sometimes; then indeed let him dare on the operation.
And indeed there has come to us one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that a perforated magdan was made in Alayrach, from which water is drawn.
But indeed I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that; nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the shapes of the species from the magda, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon them.
Let them be made properly of bronze; and let their extremities be triangular with the same subtlety, and the extremity sharp.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
Concerning the treatment of flesh grown in the nose.
Sometimes diverse fleshy growths arise in the nose, some resembling a scorpion with many legs; and from this there is cancerous, stony, dark-coloured flesh; and from this there is soft flesh, not dark-coloured.
In those fleshy growths that are soft, not fraudulent nor cancerous, it is necessary to make the patient sit between your hands facing the ground, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into the flesh. Then pull the growths outward, and cut what you have grasped with a fine, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
If anything remains from it whose removal is not possible, then scrape it away with one of the fine instruments easily, until nothing is left of it. If, however, blood overwhelms you, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hurry to cauterize it, until the blood is separated and all the flesh is removed.
Then vinegar and water, or wine, should be applied to the nose after the incision. If, however, the nose opens, and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that inside it there is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nostril, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary to introduce a linen thread of some thickness, with many knots tied in it, and place a space of a finger's width, or less, between each knot.  And let the sick person push one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or with whatever is possible for them, after having made it similar to a probe.  And let them pull out their odor, until it reaches the abscess and emerges over their throat.
And often boys in schools make something similar to this atomi; and it is an easy matter for him who wishes.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which emerges from the nose, and the other which remains in the nose. Then cut away the flesh with the knots that are on the thread. Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread; and apply to the nose after cleansing the blood a compress soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh.
Then place a lead cannula at the end of the thing in the nose for several days, until it is healed.
If however it needs a treatment that dries it, use that.
To make a nasal douche, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: it should be like a small lamp, open like a seashell; and its passageway similar.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula, like a tube.
And the seashell instrument for nasal douching should be full, uncovered; which has a handle at its rear, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices and flowing substances.
Chapter XXV.
Often a boil is born at the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and increases in size with the days, until its appearance becomes unsightly.
And because of that, it is necessary to cauterize it at the beginning of its appearance, and to eradicate its entire being. Then place over the area either a cautery or a burning medicine that acts in its place.
If its incision is delayed until it grows larger, then consider, if it is stony, hard, dark in color, and with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
For I have often seen that one who incised a man's abscess, and great harm came from it to the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that its incision is possible throughout its entirety, then evacuate the pus, and incise it without fear, without apprehension; and treat the area with something that dries and contracts it until it is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little help is given by surgery to it, except in certain individuals.
Therefore, when something from that happens to someone, you should consider if it is a recent wound with its own blood; and then bring together the edges of the wound with a suture; afterwards, care for it until it heals.
And if the edges of the separation of continuity are already separated, and each part is healthy: then it is necessary that you scrape away every part from its visible skin until it bleeds. Then bring together the two edges with a suture, and tighten them, and powder over it the blood of the dragon and ground olibanum; and place on top of the powders a piece of a diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two or three days. Then loosen it and change the medicine, and leave it until the threads come loose by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is, that you bring together the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the belly; or bring together the separation with thread, as I have made you know.
Chapter XXVII.
Concerning the extraction of lip nodules.
Many people frequently suffer hard abscesses resembling plant seeds on the inner parts of their lips: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn back the lip, and to cut above every nodule on it, and to lift it with a hook, and to cut it from every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with pounded zegi, until the blood ceases.
Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place where there is astringency should be treated with it, until the wounds are healed.
Chapter XXVIII.
Concerning the incision of flesh growing on the gum.
Often flesh grows on the gum, which the ancients call a  bulging.
Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook, or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood run.
Then place on the area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter XXIX.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
Sometimes rough, foul, and sometimes blackened, and yellowish or greenish, hard crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer sides, and between the gums, until that corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become unsightly through it.
Therefore, you should have the sick person sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, on which the crusts, and matter like sand, appear, until nothing remains of them; and similarly, deal with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and the rest, until they are cleansed.
If therefore what is in them is removed from the beginning of scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them on another, second, and third day, until finally your desire is achieved.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of diverse shapes and many forms, according to what is prepared for your operation; for the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes.
And these shapes of scrapers be prepared by you, which you see.
Chapter 30.
Of the extraction of toothache.
You ought to treat the tooth from its pain with all skill, and delay in its eradication. For there is nothing to replace its function when it is eradicated, since it is a noble substance; until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary when the sick person is forced to eradicate it, that it may be strengthened, and that the aching tooth be certified by you.
For often the pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth itself and eradicates it; then the pain does not recede until the sick person's tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen that from the operation of blood-letters.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified by you, then it is necessary that you make incisions around the tooth with a lancet, in which there should be something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side; then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first slowly, until you dislodge it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and place the patient's head between your knees; which you have now firmly held, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take some of those instruments, and insert it underneath it from every side with ease, and try its movement, as you did at first.
If however the tooth is perforated or decayed, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the end of a fine reed, so that it is not broken at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you meticulously perform the incisions around the gum from every side very much.
And maintain your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person with greater harm than its initial pain.
And beware that you do not do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their boldness in eradicating it, other than that which we have described.
For they often cause great ailments in people, which are more difficult to break, and all or some of its roots remain; or that they extract it with some of the jaw bones, as we have often witnessed.
Then it should be washed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often does occur), then apply some of the zegi, and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps, with which the tooth is first moved, should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth.  They should be like you see handles that are thick, so that when you tighten them, they do not yield or double; they should have short extremities, and be made of good iron, or of properly made steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities there should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and tighten with a suitable, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are made like the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter XXXI.
Concerning the removal of teeth, and the extraction of broken jawbones.
When, during the removal of a tooth, something remains, then it is necessary to apply a poultice of butter to the area for one or two days, until the area is softened.  Then introduce to it algasti or forceps, whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork. However, this is the shape of the forceps.
Their extremities should be made like a file inside, or like an aliskilfegi.
If, therefore, it does not yield to you for removal with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully expose the root and remove all the flesh, and insert the instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short, somewhat thick, and not soaked, so that it does not break.
If therefore the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular with a certain thickness at the extremity.
The form of the extremity is triangular and slender.
And with other instruments and tools which have preceded in the consideration of teeth.
There is also assistance with this instrument, which resembles a large hook, of this form: triangular extremity twisted, with a certain thickness so it will not break; and let it not be soaked.
And know that there are many instruments for teeth; and similarly, other instruments are not counted, and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument according to which the operation and the illnesses themselves indicate to him.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not say there is an instrument, owing to the diversity of their kinds.
If however a bone of the jaw, or of other bones of the mouth, breaks or rots, then search upon it in its place with what is suitable to it from among the instruments and forceps that I have spoken of in the extraction of roots, and assist with a forceps, whose form is this.
Let it have a certain gradual thickness, so that the bone is grasped or held with it, and does not escape and go, until the bone comes out; and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
If however there is a small rot in the bone, then scrape it from its rot and care for it until it is healed.
Chapter XXXII.
Of the sawing of teeth that protrude above others.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an unsightly form results; and especially when this occurs in women and girls, namely those who are for sale.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider. For if a tooth is born behind another tooth, and it is not positioned properly, or its sawing or filing is not possible, then remove it; and if it is joined to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the tooth's hardness, and so that another tooth is not moved.
If, however, it is prominent, exposed to its filing: then file it with a file of tempered iron, whose form is this.
Let it be entirely of tempered iron, and its handle of very small points, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, and finally shave it with some razors.
If it is a tooth from which a part has broken off, and it injures the tongue, then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed and it is made even; and flattened, so that it does not injure the tongue, nor impair speech.
Chapter XXXIII.
Of the retention of teeth with gold threads.
When the anterior teeth suffer concussion and displacement from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on it without it falling out, and you have treated them with astringent remedies, and the treatment was not successful, then a device for them is to be tied with gold thread, because silver turns green and putrefies after days, but gold never changes.
And let the thread be medium in fineness and thickness according to the amount that it can hold between the teeth.
And the manner of retention is, to take a thread, and to insert double its length between two sound teeth; then to weave the two ends of the thread between the loosened teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weave to a sound tooth on the other side. Then repeat the weaving to the point from which you began; and tie your hand with care and wisdom, until it is not removed at all; and let your tightening of the thread be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip out.
Then cut the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors; and gather each, and turn them with forceps; and hide them between the sound tooth and the displaced tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue; then let it be so tightened that it remains.
If however it is loosened, or cut, tighten them with another thread, and it will stand with it in this way for the entire time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the figure for retention of two sound teeth and two displaced teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after their fall, and are held as we have described, and remain; and only a skillful, prudent, and experienced craftsman can do this.
And sometimes a piece of bone is fitted; and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the gap, whereby the tooth is strengthened and tightened, as we said; and it remains, and is preserved with it for a long time.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
And the operation on it is that you open the patient's mouth at his head in your presence, and raise his tongue; then cut that nervous ligament across, until the tongue is released from its restraint.
If there is hardness and knotting in it, and it is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and split it across until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is released.
And beware, lest there be a fissure deep in the flesh, and you cut an artery there, and a flow of blood occur.
Then wash the area of the incision with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Then place a linen bandage under the tongue, which the patient should hold all night, so that it does not heal a second time.
If a flow of blood occurs, then apply crushed zegi to the area. If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a freckled cautery, which is suitable for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue resembling a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it enlarges so much that it fills the mouth.
And the procedure in this is to open the patient's mouth before the sun, and examine the abscess.
If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, and the patient has no feeling in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is tending towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from every side. If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place crushed zegi on it until the blood ceases; then return to your operation until you extract it with its entirety.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the appropriate remaining treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
Sometimes there occur between the throat, that is, glands, which are similar to algodad, which occur from outside; and they are called the two tonsils; which when you treat them with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
If therefore it is a hard abscess, of dark colour, with little feeling, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is of red colour, and its root is thick, then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, rather leave it until it ripens. And then either you will pierce it, or it will break by itself.
And if it is of white colour, round, and its root is subtle, then it is necessary to cut it.
And the operation upon it is that you should consider before its operation, if its abscess has rested in quiet complete, or is lessening by some diminution; then therefore make the sick person sit before the sun, and his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let the servant take between his hands, and press his tongue downward with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as subtle as a knife.
When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and pull it outward as much as you can, beyond which pull out with it some of the coverings.
Then cut it with an instrument, whose form follows this. It resembles shears; however, its extremities should be curved, so that the orifice of each of them is in a direct line with the other sharply; hence take care that it be made of tempered iron or dipped in alfuled.
If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this. Be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same method of incision.
Then after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however a flow of blood should happen to him, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar things from astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped: then care for him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils. Therefore, cut it according to what I said about the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And indeed I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was drawing to blackness, with few senses, which had almost closed her throat; and the woman was breathing from a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her eating and drinking water; and she had already come to death, if she had remained for one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, until they had emerged above the two nostrils.
Therefore I quickly hastened, and I fixed a hook in one of them. Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Then I cut it, where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same to that which came out of the other nostril.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess; then I cut a portion from it, and only a little blood ran from it: therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took food.
Therefore, I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times for a long time, and the abscess would succeed in the place of that which I was cutting, until it was excessively prolonged, and along with it that which was in it.
Therefore, I devised, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore, it stood from the addition; then I walked away from it, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
Concerning the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes an abscess, and is long, then it is called a perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the hot abscess has calmed down from it, and is subtle; then it is necessary to cut it.
And what is gathered from it, round, and has no length, and is blood-red, or brown, or black, and has no sensation; then it is necessary to avoid its incision. For there is fear in it for the sick person.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I said, from its whiteness and length, you must make the sick person sit in front of the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument of which the description preceded; then fasten a hook into the uvula and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary not to cut from it except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you cut from it more, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then, after the incision, use that which we have described in the incision of the two tonsils, and care for it until it heals.
If, however, the sick person is terrified by the incision, then it is necessary to use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear and panic.
And the method of the cautery on it is not, unless with sharp water; and it is, that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom. Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned. Then take from the water which I said to you in the chapter on cauterization, and make with it an unquenched lime, and place it not thick, nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the shape.
Let the extremity of it on which the medicine is placed have a concavity, like the concavity of a spoon's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself; and let the sick person lie on his side, so that saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing may descend from it to his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you shall apply it to the uvula for a half-hour's quantity, until you see it blackened and the gnawing of the medicine settled.
And if you wish to take a clot, and wrap it on the extremity of the radius, and infuse the clot with the medicine, and introduce the radius with the clot into the cannula from above, until the clot adheres to the uvula.
Do this many times, until you achieve what you desire concerning the cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it; for it dries and falls off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  And after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a cloth soaked in butter, and cleanse with whatever is around it from the medicine. And rinse with cold water.
And treat externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until healed.
This method of treatment is therefore healthier and further from fear.
And sometimes the uvula is treated with something finer than cautery and incision; for it is treated with fumigation, in this way. Take calamus, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil them. And let the pot be well-coated with clay; and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument be placed in this manner.
Let it be made of silver or bronze; and let the end, in which is the pomegranate, be inserted into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula above the cannula, until the uvula is greatly darkened.
Then repeatedly over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the arrival of the abscess. For it usually adds to the abscess; and it is not fitting that you do it except at the decline of its hot stage.
If however this instrument is not present for you, then take a cannula, and attach a piece of egg-shell to its end; so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned; because the egg-shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from good treatment with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Often a bone, or a fish bone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract what is apparent from them upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the sun, and it is revealed to you what is in the throat.
And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the weak vomit before the food is digested in the stomach. Perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the weak swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it to a thread, then swallow it. When therefore it reaches the place where there are the spines, or bone, and is extracted, then it comes out.
If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this shape.
Let it be thicker than a Radius a little, and at its extremity let there be a bend, which he shall introduce into his throat with ease; and let him have his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing befall him, and let him propel with it the bone, or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
But that which the sick person introduces is better, on account of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing; and let him propel it downwards, or draw his hand with the instrument upwards, the whole of it according to the quantity that is prepared for him, until it comes out.
Concerning the extraction of the Leech.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
When the leech is treated with what I have said in the division concerning treatment with medicines, and does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person before the sun, or in the sun, after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I have told you.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with slender instruments properly.
If it is not possible with these, then take a concave tube, and introduce it into the throat of the sick person up to near the throat; then introduce into the concavity of the tube a heated iron with fire. Do this many times; and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand. For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
However, if it does not emerge with what we have described, then fumigate the sick person with lice, or with asa with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do that many times, because it will fall itself.
And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which there are live prunes with fire; and the pot be covered with a lid, in whose middle be a hole; and the extremity of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Then emit the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth on the extremity of the tube, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not emerge, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech. For the leech will immediately fall.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt, and garlic, and do not drink water.
Therefore, it is necessary that it emerge with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it visibly.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat. And its extremity is similar to the mouth of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and care in general.
Chapter XL.
Abscesses have many kinds, and are of many types, according to the account of them, namely one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation and their incision in two ways.
One of which is from the species of abscess in itself, and because it comprises humidities.
And the second method is because of the places, in which it happens in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And of abscesses there are some which should not be perforated, unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion; and of them there are some which should be perforated, while they are raw and have not matured according to completion.
Like abscesses which are near the joints.
Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint, and continues to grow until the surrounding tissue is putrefied, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: wherefore it is the more proximate cause of the contraction of that member.
Or it is an abscess near a main limb; because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that limb or the main limb through it.
Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it unripe; and it is not necessary to perforate a raw, incompletely digested abscess, except that which is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become incurable at its end.
One should know the time of perforation of a matured abscess according to its completion: and it is by the cessation of pain, the decrease of fever, the reduction of redness, and of throbbing, and sharpness of the abscess head; and the other signs.
And it is necessary to make the same perforation in the lower and more prominent place of the abscess; and let the perforation extend along the body's length, if the abscesses are in the hands and feet, and in the places of the tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and lastly in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those which are reflected, proceed with the perforation along that limb.
However, when the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to its completion.
For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps its edges and depth will be hardened.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body, when necessary, or according to the part of the limb it affects.
And it is necessary that you make a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses, or many incisions in proportion to the size of the abscess.
And there are abscesses in which the skin must be hollowed out, and incised when it has already become like a rag, and has reached a point where it is already dead, as happens in many boils and buboes.
And some of them are cut with a three-angled incision. And some of them are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an inguinal abscess.
And among them are some in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision are administered, and similar incisions to these.
However, that which has no head, like mild, superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial, or merely a flat, perforation.
And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract only a portion of it. Then plug the abscess until another day. Then extract some more of the pus again.
Do this repeatedly according to a gradual approach, until it is discharged: especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an aged and decrepit person; for the animal spirit of the creature is often resolved with the discharge of the pus; and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider. If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen, or old cloth. And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures in the perforation, then it is necessary that you introduce a bandage into every fissure until they meet.
And if in the abscess you have cut off a portion of skin, or have hollowed it out around the edges: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven or trimmed with linen fuzz without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then discard it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
If however a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth is soaked in them: and place it repeatedly on the place of the bleeding.
If however the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places in this book of ours, and in the division.
If however it is in the time of winter, and the location of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse cushions with warm wine and oil: and place them over the locations.
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place cushions soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make the whole thing cold. Until when the third day shall have arrived, as we have said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and clean it, and administer to its treatment what is appropriate for it, until it is healed.
This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Following the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment in separate chapters.
Chapter XLI.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and are of the type of knots, which the coverings (tunics), which are like sacs, contain: as if they were the pullets' crop.
And their types are numerous.
Some are fatty; and some contain moisture similar to mud; and some contain moisture similar to gruels and porridges; and similar to these; and some are hard, stony.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, provided that in their incision, an artery does not oppose.
And the operation in their incision is to test them with an instrument, whose form will come after these, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it by an incision along its length, by a superficial incision, according to this form.
And begin with an incision from line b. to line g.  When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the container which holds that moisture, and do not leave anything from it at all.
For it often returns if anything remains from it.
Then immerse the cut in Egyptian ointment, if present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day. For it will corrode what remained from the container.
Then again apply Egyptian ointment over the cut, a second, and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains from the container; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
If the abscess contains a fatty lump, then cut it according to this form, the incision having the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two arms of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and try your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
If, however, an artery offers resistance, then do that which I will tell you later.
And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, by incision and treatment the same, according to what we said.
And the incision upon a stony abscess is easier, because it is of little blood and moisture. And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in certain people, with which there is absolutely no moisture.
Which is: because I incised upon an abscess in the head of an old woman, and found an abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it with anything in throwing, it wounded them.
In other abscesses, however, occurring in the head, apart from these abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, their incision should all be a superficial incision.
Or make their perforation always from their lower part, so that the course of pus may be relieved downwards.
Then treat it with whatever is suitable for them from the treatment.
Concerning the incision of tumors on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These abscesses often occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those that occur on the neck, there are single ones and many; and they are generated from each other; and every tumor among them is within its own tunic, just as it is in nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these tumors are many. And among them are some that are stony; and among them are those that contain humors; and among them are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in any one of them that you see to be well-disposed on touch, the proximity of whose colour is manifest to the skin, and which moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you should separate it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b, to a line, g, and scrape it from every side; and extend the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said regarding abscesses of the head, and pull it out gradually.
And it is a precaution that a vein or a nerve not be cut.
And let the scalpel not be excessively sharp, so that it does not harm your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and cut what is not necessary.
However, if you cut a vein or an artery, or it hinders your operation, then place crushed zegi or some powders that stop blood in the wound, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or begins to putrefy.
For the blood is stopped then.  Therefore return to your operation until you complete it.
Then, with your index finger, investigate if any remaining small tumors or other small things remain; therefore, cut and cleanse them.
If there is a large vein at the root of the tumor, then you should not cut the tumor from its root; rather, you should tie it with a strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it.
If the entire tumor is cut, then you must bring together the two edges of the wound; and suture it immediately, after you see that there is no longer any excess fluid.
However, if you see that excess fluid remains due to the size of the tumor, then you should aim to cut its root and remove it; and apply the suture we have described.
And whatever humors the tumor contains, pierce it with a superficial puncture so that its place of maturation is apparent to you; and place the puncture from what follows below its body, as we have said.
Then, after the puncture, apply bandages with ointment, and similar things, to corrode what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed; then treat it with a wound healing ointment, until it is healed.
Chapter XLIII.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
The ancients spoke of this incision in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it; and this is the record of their words.
In those suffering from quinsy, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided; as it does not bring relief; for all the veins and lung are weak.
However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, the incision of the epiglottis should be used, to avoid the harm resulting from suffocation.
Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should cut the epiglottis beneath three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across its width, in the space between two circles, so that the incision is in the membrane, not the cartilage.  And this place is suitable for the incision, as it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the physician is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a hook. Then he should split the skin until he reaches the canal, avoiding any blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the membrane, as we have described: and the incision of the canal is signified by the phlegm that flows from it, with the tearing, and the severance of the voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
When therefore the time in which suffocation is feared has passed, bring together the two lips of the wound, and suture only the skin itself, without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Says Albucasis. The summary of this account we have given is not appropriate unless, when they see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the throat of the sick person; and the sick person is close to death, and his breathing is about to cease; they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe above the wound by a certain respiration and be saved from death: and for this reason they prescribed to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is for three days and likewise; then, therefore, they prescribed to suture the wound, and to treat it until it is healed.
And that which I myself saw was that a certain maid took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and with it cut a part of the lung passage.
And I was summoned to treat her, and I found her groaning, like the groan of a dead person.
I therefore probed the wound, and found little blood that had flowed from the wound. Therefore, I concluded that she had not cut a vein, nor a large artery; and air was escaping from the wound.
I therefore hastened and dressed the wound, and treated it until it was healthy; and nothing happened to the maid except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her former condition.
Therefore, I say that there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
On the incision of a hernia of the throat.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
And it is according to two modes: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In the natural one, certainly, there is no ingenuity.
The accidental one, however, is according to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty tumors. And the other mode is similar to the abscess that arises from the knotting of an artery. And in it there is fear, and one should not presume to cut into it with iron unless it is small; and you should probe it, and investigate it with an instrument. If therefore you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any vein, then cut it, as tumors are cut; and extract it with whatever it contains from a cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then examine all of it. Then treat the place with what is appropriate for treatment until it is healed.
Chapter XLV.
Concerning the incision on the types of Tumors.
There are many types of tumors, and I have already described all their types in the division.  And it is necessary to explain here the difference between a tumor and a boil, since this causes doubt.
Therefore, I say that when a boil is present, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the superfluity subsides and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
However, with a tumor there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains them within sacks, which are proper sacs to them, and it is according to the color of the body; and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and larger and smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture. And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I have said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a tumor, it is necessary to examine it, and first to investigate it with the instrument called the *Intromissum*, according to the form of which will be presented in the chapter following this.
And the method of investigation for abscesses and all tumors is to take this instrument and insert it into the most moist place you find in the abscess; and you should slowly rotate your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin. Then place your hand at the end, according to the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the *Intromissum*, and consider what comes out in its wake.
If, therefore, a running moisture, of whatever color, comes out, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in the other abscesses.
And if no moisture comes out in the wake of the *Intromissum*, then know that it is fatty.  Therefore, make a cruciform incision upon it, in this form, as I taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and carefully scrape the skin from every side; and protect the *kistin* if you can above it, in order to pull out the healthy tissue along with the tumor.
If, however, the *kistin* breaks during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy tissue, for this often happens, then pull it out piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if a small or large amount remains of it, the tumor returns most often.
If, however, it defeats you, and a little remains of it, then fill the wound at the completion of your work with some sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and place upon it what sits as a hot abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the tumor is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with what causes it to heal by scar tissue.
If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein there, then hurry and fill the place with pounded *zegi*, and leave it bound for two or three days until the wound becomes putrid, and the boiling of the blood ceases; then return to cutting that which remains of the tumor.
Chapter XLVI.
Concerning the exterior instruments for cutting and piercing.
Among them are the shapes of instruments for insertion, and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Let them be made of tempered iron, with square ends, properly, so that they may readily enter the abscess.
And these are the shapes of instruments for probing, and, no, that is, perforating ones: and one of them is called a 'beris', that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, openings, fistulas, and buboes, and for what is between the bones within them.
And others are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, that is, of brass, or of bronze, or iron, or silver.
And the best of them are those made of brass.
And experience also makes them of black lead, which are suitable for testing fistulas, whose concavity has bends, so that they may be reflected with their softness along those bends.
And they are again of three kinds. Because from them are long, from them are medium, and from them are short, according to the quantity of the fistula's breadth and its constriction.
The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds.
Because from them are simple ones, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And from them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And from them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and from them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because from them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Their cutting edges are sharp, other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed like this, unless that with them there is help in scraping knots, in fear of cutting a vein, or nerve: and that the infirm person is healed by them, and finds a little peace from the burning which he finds in the scraping of the abscess.
They are made of air, and are similar to a radio, with which alcohol is made: and on the wide end is a hidden Spatumilis point: and in it runs to the interior, and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
The shape of the spatulas that are hidden between the fingers when perforating abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of air or amber, round, slightly elongated, as you see: and let them be of a thinness.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping glasses be large and small, so that you cut off blood with speed when needed, and when there is no medicine present for you.
However, do not use them to cut off blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except on fleshy parts: such as the thighs of the leg, and the hip, and the arms, and the nipples, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes smaller instruments are made from them, similar to hazelnuts, in their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round, in this form.
Chapter XLVII.
Concerning the care of men's nipples which resemble women's nipples.
Sometimes the nipples of some men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble women's nipples: and they remain foul-looking abscesses.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, must cut above the nipples with a lunar incision, according to this shape from line b. to line g. Then scrape off all the fat. Afterwards, fill the wound with a flesh-producing medicine. Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
If, however, the nipple descends and softens because of its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to slit it on its two upper sides with two similar lunate incisions, each contained with the other at the ends of each, until a larger line contains a smaller one, according to this shape from line b. to line g.  Then scrape the skin between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, which is necessary from the treatment, until it heals.
If, however, you do not complete the incision that you ought to make, due to the patient's discomfort or due to blood flow, then you must fill the wound with a cloth soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes the remaining fat. Then care for it until it heals.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess that occurs under the armpit.
Chapter XLVIII.
These abscesses that occur under the armpit are of the type of hard Strophula, which contain cysts, and of those which contain moist humors.
Therefore, those of them that contain moist humors should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form, from line b to line g.  When, therefore, all that is in the abscess is evacuated with pus, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until another day.
Then the lint should be removed, and treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the type of knotted Strophulae, then cut on it, as we said in the section on Strophulae, equally.
If however the wound extends in this way to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said in what was previously stated.
Chapter XLIX.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs due to an artery and vein.
When an artery is ruptured, and the skin above it becomes consolidated, then an abscess often occurs from this: and similarly, a vein also, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is recognized that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
And that which is due to a vein, is round on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and the groins, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large. Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and what is from them also in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Therefore, for that which is from them, from the swelling of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin lengthwise. Then open the incision with hooks, afterward the artery; and free it from its tunics, until it is exposed.
Then introduce a needle beneath it, and cause it to penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then pierce the place that is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood that is in it exits, and the abscess is resolved.
Then apply a treatment that produces pus, until the ligatures fall off; afterward, treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If there be an abscess because of the incision of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what you are able of the abscess with the skin. Then introduce a needle beneath the place you held with your hand, and cause it to penetrate; and let a double thread be on it, until you extract it from the other side. Then bind the abscess with a good ligature, according to what I told you in the ligature of the grape, from two sides with two ends of the thread.
If however you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then introduce another needle with another thread under the entire abscess near the incision of the needle; press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is in it comes out; then cut the excess skin, and leave what is bound from it.
Then place upon it the poultice you soaked in wine and oil. Then administer the treatment, which is done with lint and ointments, until it is healed.
Chapter L.
Concerning the abscess that arises from the twisting of nerves.
Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, similarly an abscess occurs in the nerves: which occurs in them through blows, or arises from excessive work, and similar causes; and it happens most often in the places of assistance, or the heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a severe abscess.
Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many cases without pain; and when it is pressed with force, the afflicted person feels a sensation similar to numbness in it.
And it is not a deep-seated, accumulated abscess, rather it is beneath the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not progress forward, or backward.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with iron. For perhaps contraction will result.
However, in those that are on the head, or on the forehead, slit the skin with a lancet. If it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps, and cut it away from its root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it off; afterwards remove it, and join the wound with stitches; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter LI.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Many people frequently have growths in their bellies and other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungalia, by reason of their resemblance to fungi.
Their root is slender, and their head is large, and their lips are turned inward. And some of them are small; and some of them grow very large.
And indeed I myself have seen a man who had two growths in his belly, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, with slender roots, and their lips turned inward, and split, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Therefore I cut them, and found in one about 10.8 ounces, and in the other about 6 ounces. And the procedure for cutting them is that, if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with a slender root: then cut it with a wide spatula, and have cauteries ready in the fire.
For often a great deal of blood is expelled at its incision; therefore, hurry if blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
If you see the patient faint and afraid of the incision with the iron, then take a thread of lead, well-made, and bind it with it to the swelling; which method we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead bandage. Therefore do not cease binding the lead, as often as it presses on the growth, until it is severed, and falls away of itself without effort.
If however the growth is of large root, then in its incision is some fear and dread, especially that which is in the belly.
However, it is possible to cut half of it. Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound heals.
And beware that you do not presume to cut a growth that is of dark color, of little feeling, of foul appearance; for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I will come with a consideration of Cancer after this.
Chapter LII.
Concerning the treatment of the navel's prominence.
The navel's prominence arises from many causes. Or from fissures in the skin covering the abdomen; and from it emerges wind, or an intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures. Or from blood flowing from a vein or an artery, as previously stated. Or from wind constricted within it.
If however it is due to a fissure in the skin, and the protrusion of a part: then its color resembles the color of the body, and it is smooth, without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the emergence of an intestine, then its location, along with what we have described, shows a more significant variety. When therefore you press it with your fingers, it hides; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it greatly increases at the entrance of the bath, and with strenuous exertion.
If however it is due to moisture, it is smooth, then it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor does it increase.
If however it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black from the sides.
If however it is due to a formed flesh, then the abscess is severe, large, hard, and fixed to a single size.
If however it is due to windiness, then its touch is smooth.
And the operation on it is, that you should then consider, if the protrusion of the navel is due to blood of artery or vein, or windiness: then you should refrain from its cure. For in it there is fear and terror, as I taught you in the chapter where I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
If the protrusion of the navel is due to the intestine or hernia, then you should command the sick person to hold his breath and stand stretched out. Then mark with ink around the entire navel. Afterwards, tell him to lie on his back in your hands. Then surround with a broad spatula the area around the navel over the place you marked with ink. Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook. Then bind it firmly around with a thread, or with a silken cord of strong ligament: and let the knot of the ligament be tied.
Then open the middle of the abscess that has been extended above the ligament. If therefore you find it already grasped by the ligament, then pull out the tied part, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine inwards towards the belly; and if you find a fold, then take it with a hook and cut off its excess.
If, however, the artery or vein is contrary to you, then surround it much. Then return to your operation. And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles around the circumference you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, making them penetrate.
Then tighten the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh rots and falls away on its own; or cut it when it becomes thin and rots.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments until it is healed.
If the protrusion of the navel is from flesh growing in it, or from moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess, as we have said. And extract the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Then treat it with that which hardens the place.
Chapter LIII.
Concerning the treatment of CANCER.
We have already spoken in the division of the types of Cancer, and how there is a way to treat it with medicines, and caution in treating it with iron, so that it is not ulcerated: and we have spoken of Cancer generated in the womb, and caution in treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as Cancer in the nipples or in the thigh, and similar parts, by removing the entire tumor, especially when it is small and beginning.
However, when it is old and large, one should not approach it.
For I could not heal anyone from it, nor did I see anyone before me who had succeeded in that.
And the treatment for it, when it is situated as we have said, is to proceed and relieve the afflicted person from black cholera at times. Then, if you find it with evident fullness, perform phlebotomy.
Then prepare the patient with the preparation in which he will be positioned for the operation.
Then apply the hooks suitable for the Cancer. Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to the probing, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, rather express the areas, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with any instrument possible there.
If, however, a conflict occurs for you with the flow of thick blood from the incision of the artery, or vein: then cauterize the vein, until the blood is cut off. Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Dropsy.
Chapter LIII. We have already recounted in the division of the species of Dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only a species of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron in the species of tympanitis: nor in the species of hyposarca at all; for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this species of tympanitis Dropsy with medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then consider. For if weakness has already overtaken the patient, or there is another illness with him besides dropsy, such as if there be cough with him, or looseness of the belly, and things similar to them, then beware of treating him with iron, because there is fear of it.
If however you see a patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him other than dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the method of operation in him is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and a servant behind him will express his belly by pushing the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a pointed spatula, according to this form. Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with sharp ends like a spatula. However, let there be something of shortness gradually, so that you do not proceed with it in the operation all the way to the intestines, and injure him.
Then consider. For if there is generation of dropsy from the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend the incision from the navel a quantity of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubis.
If however the generation of dropsy is due to a disease of the liver, then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Then pierce through the entire skin with an instrument. Then introduce it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and do so, as if you were to scrape it; and let the amount that is scraped be the amount of a fingernail, or approximately that.
Then pierce, doing so until the spatula reaches the empty space: and that is the space of the water. Then withdraw it, and introduce into the hole an instrument of this form. And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; on whose lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side; and the end of it is cut, according to the manner of a reed's incision, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it itself descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a moderate quantity.
Because if you evacuate more from it than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour by the resolution of his animal spirit; or a swoon happens to him that approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the sick person's condition signifies to you from the strength of his pulse, and from his well-being.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
That is, because it is immediately retained due to the skin that retains the opening which is above the sifac: about which I narrated, that you pierce it according to that method.
Then again use the instrument on the following day, if you see the sick person can tolerate it; and also extract a small amount from the water.
Do that for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until little remains of the water.
However, if you fear for the sick person and you remove a large quantity of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and with copious sweating in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed; and cauterize above the stomach, and the liver, and the spleen, after the extraction of water, according to what I have narrated in what preceded.
Concerning the treatment of infants born in places where their urinary passages are not perforated.
Chapter LV.
When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and its urinary opening is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is in the wrong place.
Therefore, it is necessary to aid with its perforation immediately when it is born, using a very fine Spatumili, according to this method.
Then place a fine leaden peg in the opening, and tie it; and hold it for three days, or four.
When, therefore, it wishes to emit urine, it is removed, and it urinates. Then replace it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
However, the one whose opening is constricted is medicated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
However, those in which the opening is in an incorrect place are harmed. That is because, of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: wherefore they cannot urinate forward, until they raise the penis with their hand upward. Nor is there generation for this reason, because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line: and it is a very foul sickness.
And the method of operation in that case is that the sick person be laid on their back. Then extend his penis with your left hand forcefully, and cut the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp blade, or a sharp scalpel, just as one would cut a reed or shave something, so that its middle resembles the head of the penis, and so that the opening comes into the middle in the way that it ought to.
And beware of blood flow during your operation. For it often happens. Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the bleeding, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning what happens in the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These afflictions frequently occur in the penis, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
And from it some are malignant, and others not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook and cut away, until the entire thing is cleansed. Then place over it a poultice soaked in Egyptian unguent. Then treat it afterward with the unguent of dyafinicon, until it is healed.
If, however, it is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
If, however, the Albather is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and a part of the Albather is within the foreskin and a part of it outside, then it is necessary to remove the Albather, which is inside first, until when it is consolidated, then treat it externally; because when you treat it simultaneously, the foreskin is not safe from being pierced.
And they also occur in the testicles, and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption. Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize all that is already blackened and that wishes to corrupt, or that is already corrupted.
Then apply over it, after that, a paste made of honey mixed with the ground flour of pomegranate bark and pounded herbs.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
If however a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is helpful for two conditions simultaneously, namely for a flow of blood and a wound when it is corrupted.
If the head of the penis is corroded and destroyed entirely within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra so that the patient may urinate over it.
However, when the foreskin adheres to the head of the penis, and this adhesion occurs only in those whose foreskin is healthy and does not require circumcision, and sometimes it happens due to a wound or abscess: therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili until the ligament is loosened and the head of the penis is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to discern these things precisely, then it is necessary to scrape some of the head of the penis and foreskin. This is because when the foreskin is thin, it might perhaps be perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine until it is consolidated.
Chapter LVII.
Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is by our operation, by our will, and its use is proper to children, it is necessary that we signify in it a better operation and a smoother path leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and there is nothing about it except what we have acquired through experience.
This is because I have found the majority of surgeons and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a scalpel and scissors, and using ligatures and tying with thread and incisions with a knife.
And I myself have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors and a ligature with thread.
Because in cleansing with a scalpel, the skin often slips away. Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers, therefore perhaps the upper skin is incised, and the lower layer remains; therefore, it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and future pain will result. And with the cleansing that is done with forceps, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured, because perhaps it enters its opening.
In cleansing with a knife, perhaps the instrument slips, and corrupts your operation; and the skin of the boy is of short nature, and often they are born such that they do not require cleansing; and I have already seen that.
However, cleansing with scissors, and ligation with thread, has shown me a good method: because scissors are proportional to the incision, because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below. Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they cut according to one operation at one time: and a compression of similar shape is made, containing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which there is no error at all.
And the method of the proper operation is, that you should make the boy, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, understand that you do not do anything but tie a thread to his penis: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way possible to you, from that which his intellect receives. Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be seated: and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy sees neither them nor anything of the instruments at all.
Then insert your hand into his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it upward until the head of the penis emerges. Then cleanse it of the filth that gathers on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread. Afterwards, tie a second ligature a little lower. Then hold the lower ligature site with your index finger and thumb, with good retention, and cut between the two ligatures. Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and pull out the rod's head. Then let the blood run slowly (for this is better), and put powder on top; and on top of the powder a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in rosewater, mixed with good fresh rose oil; and leave it on it until the next day; and treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
The form of the scissors for cleaning is this.
Let the two ends be blunt and inclined; so that a nail fragment does not protrude from them; and the length of the two sharpened parts should be equal to the length of the two handles.
A mistake, however, occurring in cleaning is: that perhaps the inner skin is completely or partially escaped at the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your fingernail before the abscess of the place; and cut it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
If, however, three days have passed, and that which is under the rod remains swollen, abscessed: then leave it until the abscess is ripe, and carefully peel it away, and cut it according to what has been prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod. For it will not harm it.
Therefore, treat it with what consolidates wounds from the powders, which we have narrated in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised from the skin beyond measure, and escapes upwards, that will not harm it either.
Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII.
Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a grown flesh, and similar things to those which we have mentioned from the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary for him to be bent over his knees. Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him stretch his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and let the sick man strain his breath as much as possible. Thus it is forced with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone backwards: wherefore the urine is released.
If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe on the sick person, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: It should be of silver, and be thin, smooth, concave, like a bird's feather quill in thinness, a length like one and a half handspans; to which there should be a thin tube at its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie to its end wool, or tow, a good ligature; and you introduce the thread's end into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if any excess of wool remains, but introduce it into the tube with force, as with a lever.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and make the sick person sit upon a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its urethra with moist oils, and olive oil, and lukewarm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the urethra with ease, until it reaches the root of the urethra.
Then double it upwards from the navel.
Then force the syringe within it, until it reaches the bladder, and let the sick person feel it has now reached the empty place; and this is not done according to this order, unless because the passage, in which it goes, is in which there is twisting.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually. For urine will follow the wool.
Then draw it out, and cause the urine to run through the urine passage; and again syringe, and do not cease to do it, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief.
Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
When a sore occurs in the bladder, or blood is clotted in it, or pus is collected in it, and force is used to pour water and medicines into it: then let it be done with the instrument called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
For it is deaf, that is, closed. And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the hollow place, in which that which propels it is situated, shall be according to the quantity that fills it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, moisture is drawn out: and when it is propelled, it expels it to a distance; according to what the clepsydra does, with which naphta, that is, Greek fire, is projected in naval battles.
Therefore, when force is used to project the moisture into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with that which propels it upward, for moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Then introduce its extremity into the tube, according to what we have described in the syringe. Then propel the moisture with that which propels it, for that moisture will reach the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it.
A slender form of clyster, by which the bladder is cleansed.
Let it be made of silver, or brass: whose head be higher, resembling a small alca, and beneath it a sinus into which a ligature may fall.
Then take a ram's bladder, and place in it the moisture with which you wish to cleanse the bladder. Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligature made of doubled thread; and warm that moisture a little over the fire.
Then insert the end of the clyster into the tube, then squeeze your hand over the bladder with a suitable constriction, until the sick person feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.
If, however, you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around its circumference. Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve. Then bring the circle together, as a vessel is brought together; after you place in it whatever you want of moistures, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter LX.
Concerning the extraction of the Stone.
We have already discussed the division of the types of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have described the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of each: and I have explained the stone in which operation with the hand and incision is necessary, and it is the stone generated in the bladder properly; and the one that adheres to the urethra; and I am narrating it with clear explanation and brevity.
I say therefore, that stone generated in the bladder, most often occurs in children.
And among its signs is that the urine exits from the bladder like water in its fineness, and white sand appears in it, and the infirm person rubs their urethra, and suffers with it, and often hangs down. Then it is erected, and the anus emerges with it in many of them.
And the cure is easy for children, as long as they reach fourteen years. And it is difficult in the elderly. However, in young people, it is moderate, in that which is between those things: and the cure is easier for him whose stone is larger; and if it is small, the cure is conversely difficult.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will remove all the stool that is in their intestines; for it sometimes hinders the finding of the stone during examination.
Then let the sick person be taken with their feet, and shaken and moved downwards, so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or leaps from a high place sometimes.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the entire bladder becomes inclined downwards.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then immediately proceed with incision upon it.
If however it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe your index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if he is a fully grown young man, and insert it into his anus and examine for the stone, until it is under your finger, and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place whose incision you wish, and command a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to remove the skin that is under the testicles on the side of the place where the incision is.
Then introduce a spatula, the shape of which is this. And find it in the space between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the left of the buttocks, and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision be wide externally and narrow internally, according to the amount that it may be possible for the stone to exit through it no larger.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it exits without difficulty.
And know that if the stone has angles and edges, therefore its exit becomes difficult because of that.
And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round, then its exit is easy.
Therefore, to the one which has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
If it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you devise above it: either that you grasp it above with a suitable instrument, whose extremity is like the Moon, which grasps the stone and does not slip from it; or that you introduce under it a slender instrument with a curved extremity.
If however you cannot above it, then enlarge the opening a little. If something from the blood overcomes you, cut it off with a zegi.
If however the stones are more than one, then first drive the large one towards the bladder's opening. Then cut above it. Afterwards drive the small one after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then ignorance it is to cut above it with a large incision. Because it happens to the sick person one of two things, either that they die or that a constant dripping of urine occurs to them: because the place is not completely consolidated.
But administer its expulsion, until it comes out: or make incisions in its fracture with scissors, until you extract it piece by piece.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that a hot abscess might settle.
Then lay the sick person on their back, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day. When therefore you have loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with dyafinicon ointment, and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
If however in the wound a hot abscess is added, and corrosives, and similar things: such as if blood should congeal in the bladder, and the urine be prevented from it: and this is recognized from the passing of blood with the urine. Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract the blood. For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply whatever is appropriate from the treatments, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the entire period of treatment, to tie the two hips, and to apply, for the sake of the medicines that are placed on the place.
If the stone is small, and is in the passage of the penis, and is fixed in it, and prevents the exit of urine: then treat it with what I mention before you reach the incision. For often you will be spared the incision by this treatment, for I have already proven it.
And it is, that you take a perforator of iron, whose shape is this, triangular end, pointed, fixed in wood.
Then take thread, and tie the penis with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is discharged immediately.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outside of the penis. For it will break, and exit with the urine, and the sick person is cured.
However, if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone, on the penis itself, between the two ligatures. Then extract it. Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood, which forms in the wound.
And the ligature of thread under the stone is not necessary, unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and the other ligature above, unless so that, when the thread is loosened after the stone's expulsion, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound; and for that reason it is necessary for you to raise the skin upwards, when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we said.
Chapter LXI.
Concerning the extraction of the stone in women.
Little stone is generated in women.
However, if a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is forbidden because of many ways.
One of them is that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
And the second is that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or from those having husbands.
The third is that you do not find a woman well versed in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: therefore it needs a deep incision, and in that is fear.
If necessity provokes it, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-versed: and few are found.
If however you entrust it to her, then seek a chaste, skilled physician, and present a skilled female midwife knowledgeable in women's matters, or a woman who hints at part of the art in this skill: make her present, and especially for her, do all that you order her from the inquiry about the stone.
First of all, that he should look to see if she is a virgin: then it is necessary that he insert his finger into her anus, and search for the stone.
If therefore he finds it, he should confine it under his finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the infirm woman, and inquire about the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and compressing it with a good compression.
If therefore he finds the stone, then it is necessary that he gradually move it from the orifice of the bladder downwards with all his strength, until he reaches it with the root of the thigh.
Then cut upon it at the midpoint of the vulva near the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for him, and feels the stone in that part: and his finger not to be removed from the stone, confining it underneath: and let the incision be small at first. Then insert a reed over that incision.
Then insert a reed over that incision. If therefore he feels the stone, then let him add to the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the kinds of stone are many. For of these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Know therefore its species, so that this may signify to you concerning that which you wish.
If therefore blood conquers you, then add in that place crushed zegi, and hold it one hour, until the blood is severed.
Then return to your operation, until the stone emerges; and do so, preparing for yourself from the instruments, which I said in the extraction of the stone in men, so that you may assist with them in your operation.
If, however, a flow of blood conquers you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that is cut: then place powder upon the spot, and bind it with bandages of suitable constriction; and do not change that; and leave the stone, and do not extract it. Perhaps, indeed, the weak woman will die. Then treat the wound.
When, therefore, the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place putrefies, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
Chapter LXVIII.
Concerning the incision of a watery hernia.
A watery swelling is not present unless there is a gathering of moisture in a white sifac, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called sifac.
And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it becomes putrid: which is another egg, and there is skin of the testicle between the white sifac which we mentioned; and this does not happen except rarely.
And the generation of this swelling indeed is from the weakness which happens to the testicles; wherefore this matter is poured out to them. And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colours. For either its colour inclines to yellowness, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or watery white, and that is what is more.
And the signs by which it is known where the aggregation of water is, are these. For if it is in the white sifac we have mentioned, then the abscess is round in length somewhat like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every side.
And if the moisture is in the proper covering to itself, then the abscess is round with part of an egg, and because of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the senses.
Therefore, when you desire knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose form preceded. Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the Insertion, judge of that which is between it.
When, therefore, we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you command the sick person to be bled, if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him be laid upon his back upon a slightly raised object, and place many cloths beneath him.
Then sit you upon his left side, and command the attendant to sit on his right, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the scrotum skin, and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Then take a broad spatula and cut the skin of the scrotum from the middle lengthwise, up to near the pubic bone; and let the incision be made along the straight equidistant line that divides the scrotum skin, until it reaches the white, encompassing sifac: and scrape it and observe, or beware of this, that you sever it; and let your scraping, by which you scrape it, be from the part that hangs with the egg more; and delicately examine with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then pierce the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Then separate the two edges of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upward, and do not touch the skin of the scrotum encompassing it: and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either with its entirety, or in fragments, especially its thin side. For if you do not carefully investigate, there is no security in its incision, lest the water return.
If, however, the egg protrudes externally from its skin during the time of your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, replace it. Then bring together the two edges of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds, until it heals.
If you find a corrupted egg due to another blackness, then it is necessary to tie the vessels, which are the suspensory ones, fearing a flow of blood.
Then sever the testicle with its suspensory ligament, and remove the egg; afterward, treat it with what we have said.
If however water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore, cut the other part similarly to what you did to the other one.
And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it; then wipe away the blood. And introduce into the sections wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside another wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the lower belly; and place over it doubled cloths, and they are pillows; and tie them above with a bandage, which has six sections in this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and let the edges with which it is pressed be made of linen or wet wool; and let them be gathered with a constriction at the lumbar region of the breeches; and one of the edges shall take in from the anus up to the back, and the second edge shall take in from the side of the pubic bone; and two edges over the two thighs below, and two other edges over the two groins, and the whole constriction shall be gathered in the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery in place of the incision with iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut with it the skin of the testicles; and it is heated, as we have described; until when a white substance containing water is revealed; then take the cautery, according to this form.
It is similar to the Greek letter.
Then pierce it with that, and let it be heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then stretch the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated thin cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you remove the whole of it.
And beware lest the fire touch the egg.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than an operation with a cut.
If, however, contrariety happens to you during the hour of cutting, or during the hour of cautery, a hot abscess, or blood flow, or anything else: then it is necessary that you cure whatever contrariety happens to you from it with the cure that suits it, according to what has been stated before.
If, however, the patient is fearful and does not await this operation, because of its horror: then administer perforation as I describe it: and it is so.
When it is certified to you by what we said about the signs that the limb is watery, then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula: and place the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a poultice over the affected area, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water runs out; then treat it until the wound heals.
If, however, there is an obstruction to the escape of the water at the time you perforate it, and this is only because the white membrane causes obstruction in the wound opening and prevents the water from exiting, then it is necessary that you insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of the dropsy is drawn out, of which the form preceded; or add a little to the wound treatment.
And know that the water returns, and gathers again after six months, or about that time. When it therefore gathers again, then it must be perforated in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
Chapter LXIII.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Know that in the incision upon this tumor, there is fear leading to harm in many dispositions. Therefore, it seems to me that its release is to be saved from it.
And I am remembering the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and it happens from many causes, namely.
Or from an acute or acrid superfluity which is poured forth to the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it arises from a knotting of the arteries and their swelling, as its mention has already preceded, or from a swelling of the veins.
Therefore, that which arises from the swelling of the arteries is recognized by the disposition of the abscess when you press it with your fingers. And you should not touch it entirely.
But that which arises from the swelling of the veins, nothing spreads from it upon compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that a section be made upon this type, and upon the other flesh: and it is like cutting the skin of the testicles. Then raise the egg upwards, and pull it out with a white sifach: and release the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from every part from the parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary to pull the egg and cut it.
And if there is adherence between some of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary to release all that adherence, and cut it with a round incision.
If however there is a birth of flesh in the place of adherence which is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we have said.
When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter LXIII.
Of the treatment of Ramicis, which is with the Vite.
Uitis is an abscess enveloped by a certain covering, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult for the infirm person movement and exercise, and walking.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded it, remembering.
But it is necessary, as we say, to perform the operation on it according to what the first ones did.
I say therefore, that it is necessary to make the infirm person sit upon a raised seat. Then push down the suspensory of the testicles. Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another attendant hold them, and stretch them with a forceful extension.
Then, cut with a broad, sharp spatula, a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then, scrape from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Afterwards, insert a needle with a double thread into them, and tie it in the first of the places where the veins occur: and tie it again in their last one. Then cut it in the middle, straight, along the length of the body, and remove what is aggregated from the putrid, feculent humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, in which the force generates pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle fall. For it is not evil through it.
However, if it happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed along with the vessels: so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment, on account of the incision, and withers, or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
Chapter LXV.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal colic.
The outcome of this colic is from a section, which occurs in the distended sifach above the belly in the groin region from the mirach of the belly.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle. And this rupture is either from the sifach, or from its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach. It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal towards the depth; because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is from the section of the sifach, is that it causes a sudden, intense pain at the beginning; and the abscess is different, appearing under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course outwards through the sifach.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine as a zirbum; and this is called a Ramex intestinalis, and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes faeces run into the intestine and are retained there; and with it there is harm to the sick person, since it causes a foul pain, and especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of these types of illnesses, there is fear with iron; therefore, a fall must be avoided in it.
And the method of operation is to instruct the sick person to draw back the intestine with his own hand into the inner cavity of his body, if it submits to being drawn back. Then he should be laid back on his neck between your hands, and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles all the way along its length. Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be according to the size that it is possible for the egg to emerge from it.
Then scrape the siphak, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is uncovered on every side; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is beneath the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and sever with it the adhesion which is on the back part of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand, and with this extend the white siphak upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with the siphak towards the part of the incision; and command the servant to extend the egg upwards; and you sever the adhesion that is behind the completed severance.
And check with your fingers that there is nothing of the intestine wrapped around the hard white siphak. If however you find any of it, then push it towards the lower belly.
Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is beneath the skin of the testicles that follows the incision; then cut the ends that project from the thread until there are four threads. Then arrange some of them over some others with a figure that is in the shape of a cross; and tie with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is beneath the skin of the testicles by a strong ligature, until no vessel that nourishes them can send anything to them, so that a hot abscess does not arise from it. And place another ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it by less than two fingers. And after these two ligatures, leave from the siphak, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the rest entirely around, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, by the incision from which blood and pus flow, as we have related in what was said before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound; and apply the ligature that we have described. And sometimes the white siphak that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing a flow of blood. For this often happens. And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with warm water, and place upon it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
Chapter LXVI.
Concerning the windy Ramice.
In this Ramice, I have seen no one who dared to use iron for its treatment.
And the first ones said it is like what we have described in the Ramice that is with the Vite. That is, to tie the vessels after the incision, to place them below with ease; then cut in the middle; and lastly, treat with that which opens it, until the vessels fall; and treat the wound, as we said, until it is healed.
Chapter LXVII.
Concerning the rupture that occurs in the groin.
When rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends into the testicles; and if it does descend, it is little, and returns every hour; but if the condition persists, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And that occurs from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we said. That is because the sifach extends; then the area softens, and the place becomes suppurative, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its preceding description stated.
And sometimes it is treated with an iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick person lies on their back between your hands. Then cut the suppurating and protruding area of the rupture, with a cut across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Then squeeze the alsifak and those things under the skin until, when it is uncovered, a white sifach is seen, which is under the skin that follows it.
Then take a probe, and place it on the protruding area of the sifach, and press it into the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two protruding areas on the end of the probe from the sifach, and connect one of them to the other with a suture; then pull out the end of the probe.
And do not cut the alsifach completely, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal sores.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds. When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is healed.
For the sisach contracts, and does not add a prominence of the rupture.
And a cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
Chapter LXVIII.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Often the skin of the testicles softens in some men, on account of which the flesh between them softens, and its appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore it is necessary for whoever is asked to treat it, to make the sick person lie on his back, and to cut away all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Then he shall bring together the two lips with stitches: and if you wish, stitch first the excess softened skin with three or four stitches, and make the stitch firm.
Then cut between the stitches.
Then treat the rest of the wounds with care, until they are healed, and the stitches fall out.
Chapter LXIX.
Concerning Castration.
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law, and because of that it would be permissible for me not to remember it in this book of mine; and its remembrance is not necessary unless for two ways.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it; and so that he may know the treatment for him who has suffered it.
And the other way is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit by it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration is done according to two ways. Or by attrition. Or by fissure and section.
In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we should make the animal sit in warm water, until its testicles soften and relax, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer apparent to the touch.
In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory, and cut above each testicle with one cut, until two testicles are separated; then cut them after you have flayed each one, and do not leave on them from sifak anything except thin sifak that is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter LXX.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
A hermaphrodite is from males in two ways. One of them is because there appears in it, in the space that follows, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, a shape like a woman's vagina, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine runs from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one type, and it is a woman's vagina above the pubis, like small male testicles, protruding outwards; of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of three types, two from men, and one type from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them is gone. Then treat them with the treatment of the rest of the wounds.
In the second type of men, however, from which urine issues, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all.
Chapter LXXI.
Concerning the incision of the tentigo, and the protruding flesh in women's vaginas.
Tentigo perhaps grows over a natural part, until its appearance becomes ugly and disfigured; and sometimes in some women it becomes so large that it expands like in men, and reaches to the point of coitus.
Therefore, you must hold the excess of the tentigo with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it; and do not proceed too deep in the incision, especially in the deep roots, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds, until it heals.
However, the flesh that arises is flesh which grows in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it extends outwards in the manner of a tail; and on account of that some earlier ones named the illness the tailed sickness. Therefore, it is necessary to cut it, as we cut the tentigo, and to treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the non-perforated vagina of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, that is, the vagina of a woman that is not perforated, or has a small opening. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from an illness that preceded: and it indeed happens either from added flesh growth, or a thin or thick sifach; and it occurs either deep within the womb, or on its sides, or above it, or below it; and it hinders intercourse and conception, and childbirth, and perhaps it hinders menstruation.
And knowledge of it is gained through the obstetrician's observation, if an obvious blockage is near.
If however it is not obvious, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
If however the blockage is from a thin sifach, and it is near the two lips: then hurry and break it apart.
And it is, that you place cushions upon the two lips.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be upon her back with her legs spread. Then extend the two lips with strength, until the thin sifach is broken, and the blockage is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it over the place: and let the woman do this every day, so that the place is not consolidated another time.
If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary that you cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If however the blockage is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not quickly become consolidated, hold it for a few days: and administer linen from dry flax, then treat with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
And sometimes there is born in the womb the birth of other flesh: it is therefore necessary that they are cut according to this method: as long as it is not a cancerous abscess, for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, do not use a contrary action with iron at all.
Chapter LXXIII.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in the vulvas of women.
Hemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood flows from them constantly.
When hemorrhoids age, they become thelil; and I have already spoken in the division of their types and their signs; and I will say here which of them receive a cure, and which do not.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no cure with iron for them.
However, those of them which are in the orifice of the womb over which sense falls, are those which are cured.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cool house. Then, extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then powder over them at the flow of blood from one of the powdered incisions without mortification: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things to them.
Then let him push her feet against the wall for one hour. Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, and quince bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If blood is thereby cut off, it is good; and if not, make cupping adhere to the back and the armpits without incision.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnogloss, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, or Pontic wine, and apply it to the affected area.
When the abscess subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
Albarth, however, is red, similar to alhaasse heads, and is of harsh appearance.
Therefore, you should cut away what appears from it, according to what I said in the thelil equally; and treat it until it heals.
Chapter LXXIV.
Of the perforation of the exit which occurs in the womb.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, carbuncle, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and cracks, and thelil, and hot abscess.
And I have already discussed all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about the hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with an iron.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider. Then, if the pain of the abscess in its inception is sharp with its percussion, and burning, and fever; and you see it reddening; if the feeling falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation; and treat it with that which helps in its maturation, until when the sharpness of the occurrences subsides.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that slants with two cushions, and lean back, or rest on her back, and draw her feet towards the lower part of her abdomen; and let her thighs be spread open, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix with the radius the depth of the woman's womb; so that it is not that which enters from the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak one.
However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions on the cover of the womb's depth, so that the entire entry of the instrument into the womb's depth is prevented; and it is necessary that it place a turning mechanism, which runs along the instrument, from the upper side; and so that the minister holds the instrument and turns the mechanism, until the womb's depth is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and it is touched by the hand, and is soft and gentle, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a wide spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary to place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the cloth, and extract the section in the depth of the womb.
And place externally on the womb, and on the pubic hair, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then treat it after two days with an ointment suitable to it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed, so that it is washed out with water and honey; then with water in which the lily root, or long aristolochia, has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, rather treat it with what we said in the division.
Chapter LXX.
Doctrine of Midwives, how living embryos, having emerged in an unnatural manner, are to be treated.
It is necessary for the midwife to first know the form of natural childbirth.
Therefore, among its signs is this: when you see a woman pressing downwards, desiring to smell the air, and feeling relieved from the weight upon her in labor, and the exit of the embryo is hastened, then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is upon her head, and the afterbirth with it; or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be pressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
For when it descends upon her head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluous matters by good cleansing.
However, any birth other than this is unnatural, blameworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one foot, or its head and hands, or the belly; and perhaps it is turned upon its neck, and similar, blameworthy forms.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception; and I am showing every form of them, and how the nature is in it, and how it is signified, and how to stand over it.
When the fetus emerges upon its head in its natural exit, and it becomes forceful upon the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her; and moisten her vulva with decocted fenugreek and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and with it split the secundine, and cut it with her fingernail, until that which is in it runs out by moisture; and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
If however it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then command her, after the enema, to compress herself; and make her sneeze with seasonings, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. For the fetus will immediately emerge.
If the two hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary to gently and gradually return them. If however it does not yield upon entering, then place the woman upon a seat, and elevate her feet upwards; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remaining fetus; and tie its hand with cloth and extract it with evenness; for it will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is upon its feet. When the fetus emerges upon its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterward, straighten it.
Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When therefore they emerge up to the hips, then order that it be compressed, and make it sneeze with condiments; for it will emerge, if God wills.
And if it does not emerge with what we have recounted, then return the fetus gradually, until you place it in its natural form. For it will then emerge with ease.
If it is prevented with all that we have recounted, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum, and pound the whole in a mortar with a good pounding; then line with it the vulva of the woman, and the lower part of her abdomen. Then make her sit in lukewarm water, until the hypochondria are reached.
When therefore you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a poultice of myrrh and apply it. When therefore the poultice has held for one hour, then make her sit on a seat. Then make her sneeze; and compress her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of her abdomen with a gentle pressure. For the foetus will depart immediately.
The exit of the foetus is upon the knees and hands. When it emerges in this manner, then gently insert her hands. Then the woman shall be placed on her back, and her feet shall hang downwards; and she shall lie on the bed, and fold her hands. Then press gently on her abdomen. Then draw out what is under her feet from the cushions, until it is prepared in the lower part. If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with forceful motion. Then press gently on that which is above the hypochondria, until the fetus ascends upwards. Then let her insert her hands, and gently adjust the fetus; and command the woman to bear down until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus hangs sideways from the hands. His hand be applied in the reduction. If however he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman, and make her walk.
If however she cannot walk, then have her lie on the bed, and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Then administer the liniment that you prepared from the mucilages.
If she receives it through childbirth, then have her sit on a seat. Then strive in reducing the hand, and arrange the foetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself, until it emerges.
The exit of the foetus is upon her neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is towards the back of its mother. The midwife should hold the foetus's hand, then gradually turn it, and straighten it with ease.
When it is straightened, then place upon its vulva what we have narrated concerning oil and mucilages.
Then command her to move slowly. When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to the right side. Then command her to compress it: and make her sneeze with condiments.
The exit of the prepared fetus on its side. When it descends to the opening of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is evacuated from the moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Then push the fetus inward until you place it as it should be: and command the woman to compress herself several times: for it will come out through a light exit.
The exit of twins, or of many fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three and four are born. However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Five, however, are unnatural and do not entirely live: and they are contained, however numerous, by a single afterbirth; and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing them, tied to the umbilical cord of each of them.
And sometimes they emerge like a single fetus emerges by natural, easy exit; and they emerge with an unpraised exit, as we have narrated.
If some of them are difficult at birth, and reach the unnatural figures we have described, then treat them as we have narrated; and let the midwife be skilled, and let her act with ease and slowness, and be ingenious according to every shape, along with what is prepared for her from the ingenuity leading to health.
A reminder of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has been verified with me that a woman gave birth to seven, and another to fifteen, all formed, by miscarriage.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Therefore, all this must be within the knowledge of the Midwife. For perhaps a similar case will come to her; therefore, let her oppose it with that which is necessary.
Chapter LXXVI.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the division of medication, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then it is necessary to consider.
If, therefore, the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted by any of the accidents from which harm is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid upon a bed, upon her back, and her head be inclined downwards, and her legs raised; and the attendant should hold her from two sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body is not moved during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils, along with the mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should introduce it into the womb with ease. Then she should seek, with it, the place where she can fix the hooks from the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Therefore, consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks into its eyes, or into its neck, or into its mouth, or into its palate, or under its chin, or into its fork, or into the places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubic bone and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand, and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand, and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
Then she should fix another hook, or a third if needed, in opposition to it, so that there is an equal contraction, and it does not deviate to one side.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be in a straight line only, but rather let it be moved in every direction, so that its exit may be eased, as happens with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary, in that which is between them, that the extension be softened. If a part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so as to revolve with them that which is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be shifted to another location that is higher; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
If therefore a hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to return it, because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it. Then pull it out until when the whole emerges, cut it either at the junction of the sole, or at the elbow; and thus it is necessary that you do to the other hand, and to the two feet.
If however the fetus' head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water has gathered in its head: then it is necessary that a thorny Spatumile be introduced between the fingers, and that it split the head with it, and extract the water; or that it be broken with an instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that is after this one.
Similarly, he should do the same if the fetus is naturally of a large head, then it is necessary to cut it with algengematu, or to extract it with misdach, as we said. Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it should be cut, until the moisture in the chest is discharged.
If however it does not become entangled, nor yields to exit, then cut the head into pieces, as far as possible for you.
If the lower part of the belly is abscessed or has dropsy, then it is necessary to pierce it until moisture runs from it.
If the fetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the mouth of the womb is slight.
If however it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand: and cut the belly or chest until what is in them flows out.
If however the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb, and search for the head with it, and pull it with her fingers up to the mouth of the womb: then insert one hook, or two hooks, into it, and pull it with it.
If however the mouth of the womb is constricted, due to a hot abscess that occurs to it, then it is not necessary to labor over it, rather it is necessary then to administer the effusion of moist, oily things, and administer plasters, and she should sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to straighten it; then administer what we said regarding a living fetus.
If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave any part of the afterbirth inside at all.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said regarding hot abscesses that occur in the wombs.
If a flow of blood occurs, then it should be immersed in astringent waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
And indeed I have already seen a woman in whose womb a dead fetus was: afterwards she became pregnant again over the same one, then another fetus also died. Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it became swollen until it opened: and it began to discharge pus.
Therefore, I was called to treat her, and I medicated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Therefore, I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and the bone protruded from the place. Then a few days passed, and another bone protruded. Therefore, I was amazed by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore, I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Then I investigated the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and she lived thus for a long time, and a little pus issued from the place.
And I did not consider this foreign, except because there is knowledge and assistance in it for that which the skilled physician administers with the hand in his treatment.
Chapter LXXVII.
Concerning the forms of instruments necessary for the extraction of a fetus.
The form of the hinge with which the opening is made.
Here below is the form of a Strappado, in which books are straightened, to which are equally attached two hinges on two extremities of two pieces of wood. However, this hinge should be finer than the strappado; and to be made, it should be either of ebony or of boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers; and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are now firmly attached to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the opening, so that it opens with them when you turn the two hinges.
Another form, similar to it, finer, and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps. However, at its end there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition of them is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, and opening what is between her legs. Then introduce these two joined additions into the womb: and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount of opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Another form of dizziness, which the ancients called the form of the impelling force by which the fetus is propelled.
The Almisdac form, by which the large head is crushed: and it is likened to a pair of forceps, with teeth on the end, as you see.
And sometimes it is elongated, like forceps of this form, as you see, which have teeth like saw teeth, with which it is cut and crushed.
The form of a hook with a single spine.
The form of a hook with two spines.
The form of a scalpel with two ends for severing the head.
The form of two broad scalpels.
All these instruments are exercised, and the more their types are multiplied, and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker is his operation, and the higher esteemed among men, because of their quantity.
Therefore, do not despise any instrument, unless it is prepared for you. Their necessity is indeed inexcusable.
Chapter LXXVIII.
Of the extraction of the Secundine.
When the Secundine is retained at childbirth, then it is necessary to instruct the woman to retain her breath. Then make her sneeze with condiments; and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils. If therefore it emerges by this means, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid; and place in it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, sseham, cinnamon wood, and centaury; take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them on the fire.
Then place a reed plug over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end in the woman's womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the concavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said. For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
If however it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge, then order the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then let her introduce it into the vagina, and seek out the afterbirth with it. When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
If however it be attached deep within the womb, then let her introduce her hand, as we have described, until when she has found the afterbirth, and extract it gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall during violent traction; rather, it should move easily to the right and left sides, then the amount of traction should be added. For it then obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
If the opening of the womb is constricted, as we have already described, treat it with sneezing and with medicine from a pot containing herbs.
If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself out in repeated attempts to extract it.
But it is necessary that whatever emerges from the womb to the opening of the womb be tied to the woman's hip. Then administer an enema to her with the tetrapharmacon ointment. For it will indeed cause it to putrefy after days, and it will dissolve and emerge.
However, when it putrefies, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one. Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered to it.
Some of the ancients, however, have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
Form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated during the retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to alcama, or of earthenware: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed on the prunes: let it hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
Chapter LXXIX.
Concerning the treatment of a non-perforated anus.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which have already been obstructed by a subtle sifac. Therefore, the midwife should pierce that sifac with her finger; and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp spatulum, and beware of injuring the surrounding flesh.
Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil. Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If you fear that it will be obstructed again, then insert a lead cannula into the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
And blockage of the anus also occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess. Therefore, that consolidation must be cut, then treated with what we have said about treatment and lead.
Chapter LXXX.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodules and enlargements that occur near the anus externally, or in the space of one of the parts, and are either one fistula or several.
When that nodule has become old, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
And sometimes there are penetrating fistulas from these. Therefore, penetrating ones are recognized by what emerges from defecation and flatulence when the sick person uses defecation, and perhaps worms emerge from them.
And some of these fistulas, when penetrating, are in the space extending to the bladder and to the urethra. And some of them penetrate as far as the hip joint, and as far as the tailbone.
By this, a penetrating fistula to the anus is recognized, even if not penetrating, that you insert your index finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe into the fistula, from air, or iron, when there is no winding.
If there is winding in it, then insert a thin lead probe or a hair from a horse's tail into it, until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, and nothing comes out of the opening in terms of excretion, or wind, or a worm as I said, then know that it is not penetrating; therefore, hasten to the cure.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urinary passage, then its significance is the excretion of urine from it, and the prohibition of it from this, that the place be consolidated with medicines.
If however it is penetrating to the hip joint or to the hip bone, then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no winding in it to the bone, and the finding of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus comes out of it always, and that the medication does not work in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their cure is labor and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
In that one, however, which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and I have already tested: and it is, that the sick person lie between your hands on his back, and raise his legs above his hips, and his hips be inclined towards his stomach. Then insert a lead or copper probe, if there is winding in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
If, however, the sick person feels it near the anus, then you must insert your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel the probe in your finger, having already penetrated by itself, detected, beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula or flesh; then therefore know certainly that it is penetrating; therefore do not labour on it, because there is no healing of it, as we said.
However, they said that in some men the flesh is healed, and from the medication by which help is hoped for, it is that you apply a thin cautery according to the breadth of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and you insert it, heated, into the fistula until it reaches around the anus. Then repeat it twice or thrice, until you know that all those added, filtered flesh-like, bird-feather-tube tissues are now cauterised.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those cauterised tissues come away; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If therefore it is healed, it is good.
And if not, then it is never healed with any other treatment.
And if the probe exits, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or similarly, and you see a fistula following the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe that is in the fistula until the cut reaches where the probe's end reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh, which resemble the hollow of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
However, if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you cut those flesh: then better it is done, and quicker aid, to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Because cautery with fire aggregates good habits, burning those added flesh, and removing blood, and drying out the moisture.
Then treat it with linen wrappings soaked in butter, or pounded herbs, until the place discharges pus, and those burned flesh exit in pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which generate hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there is astringency and drying.
For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear repetition.
If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from the superfluity of the body: then introduce your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a tension, and between you and it is a membrane of pus or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in it, unless according to the way of trust and hope.
That is, because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize it, as we said; or to dissect it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert ligatures, and cure from close by. And do not proceed much with the incision, so as not to sever the muscle containing the anus, and bring about an unforeseen exit of the evacuation of the bowels. Then treat it with what we said.
For perhaps it will be healed; or you will draw out the membrane, and cleanse it after cutting it close to the anus, as we said, either with a probe, or with another instrument of a sharp tip. Then cleanse those filtered flesh that are in the incision, until where you can with scrutiny.
Then try to restore the whole wound with an incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates; and an open fistula remains in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, preparing leather, according to this form. And insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and about it. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
If therefore it is penetrating into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together; and tie each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread penetrates the flesh, the better tie it, until those pieces of flesh between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in whichever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep. For you do not have the means to do that on account of the muscle, so as not to injure it.
Then do with it as we said, until it heals.
A pointed spatula, with which the fistula is split, whose curve is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not injure what is unnecessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-One.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are according to two modes. For they are either inside the anus, similar to sacks of coals or plums, or as if they were grapes themselves. And from them are small ones and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many. And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus, are mostly few and moist, from which yellow water, or little blood runs with constant flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is, that you should command the sick person to strain; and it is to be pressed out, until it exits the anus, and the athelils appear to you. Therefore also suspend them with hooks; or hold them with your nail. Then cut them at their roots.
If however the hooks do not hold on to them, because of their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with cotton from doubled wool, and pull them out with your fingers. Then cut them, and after the incision sprinkle some hot powders on them, to act as a cautery. Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization. Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then administer an enema to the sick person containing a small amount of mordicant, so that it is washed with what is in the anus, and it yields to evacuation quickly when the sick person expresses himself.
If however the piles are external from the anus, then their removal is easy and simple: and it is as if you grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and cut them off. Then treat them with what we said, until they are healed.
And he who abhors incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method. Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle. Then pull the piles upward, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be laterally: and tie the piles tightly with a strong ligature. Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do this with all the piles, and leave one of them:  nor let it be such that blood flows from it excessively.
Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose or cedar oil, and put it over the anus; and instruct the patient to rest. Then leave it until it falls off.
When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of Fissures. For they often occur from the drying out of stool and the constriction of nature.
When, therefore, they become old and medicine is of no avail, then it is necessary to scrape them with a pointed spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper layer which prevents their consolidation is removed. Then treat them until they are consolidated as they should be.
If however they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful instrument than the first, until they bleed profusely and are scraped, then treat them until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and of dry athelil and formicae.
Chapter LXXXII.
Know that almirmar is nothing other than a round swelling the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it forms throughout the body, particularly in the lower parts of the feet and the toes: and pain results from them during walking.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut what is around the nail, and hold it with shears or with a hook, and uproot it from its root.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round elevation on the surface of the body. And they frequently occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to stretch the athelil and cut it, or to bind it with silk thread or with a thread until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was mentioned before, with fire or with a sharp medicine; and now the inverted athelil are eradicated, and the non-inverted ones with the instrument that I shall name.
A formica is also a small, filtered, thick elevation on the surface of the body, going deep within; and when it encounters cold, a sensation similar to an ant's bite is felt in it and spreads throughout the body; and most of it occurs on the hands.
And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's feather, or a strong vulture's feather; and place that cannula on the Formica until the cannula's circle surrounds its parts. Then turn your hand with the cannula until you separate what is around the Formica; and put it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root.
And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air or iron, according to this form.
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn to a height, to ease the grasp and turning of the wrapped-up object above the finger.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what was previously stated in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on the cautery.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Concerning the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for bowel evacuations, and colic.
Sometimes enemas are made of silver, or brass, or cast bronze, or hammered bronze.
And sometimes these instruments are made small or large, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and for those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too should their enemas be.
Large enema.
Its tube, that is, the upper head to which the pouch is tied, should be wide in this manner; and it should have a distinction so that the pouch is tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, very, drawing toward thinness; and on one side of it there should be two openings, and on the other side one opening.
And the size of the opening should be according to the thickness of the fingers, a little larger; and let the pouch in which the medicines are placed be made from the bladder of an animal, or from parchment, which should be in the shape of a small asofrat; whose root should be one palm.
And let it be pierced with many holes as it is rolled, and let the space between each hole be the thickness of a finger. Then insert strong thread into those holes, made of ten threads, or about that many, and stitch the pouch to it as an asofrat. When, therefore, the pouch is placed in it, it should be tied at the head of the enema between two distinct constrictions by a strong binding. Then administer the enema with it.
And this is the form of the pouches here depicted, and the holes.
However, the quality of administering the enema with it is: that you fill the pouch, or bladder, with medicine that is warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and beware that it is not too hot or too cold.
Then the patient shall lie on his back, and raise his legs upwards; and place beneath him a cushion, that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things. Then introduce it into the anus with ease. Then let the attendant take the pouch with both hands together, and squeeze it with force, until it has emptied all that is in the clyster into the intestine.
Then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs to the wall.
If the medicine prompts him to defecate, then let him hold it as long as he can. And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
If, however, you clyster him in diseases of looseness of the belly, and his discharge is hasty, then clyster him again, until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or damaging abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin, gentle, from the clysters with which children are clystered.
And this should be the form of a thin clyster, above which the skin is tight.
Chapter Eighty-four.
I have already stated in the division concerning the treatment of wounds that it was fitting for the book, and I will state here the treatment of them with the hand and with remedies according to completion.
Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which the wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore, the things by which wounds are often made are like the throwing of a stone; or the cutting of a sword or knife; or the striking with a spear, or wood, or arrow; and by similar things from many things.
And the wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar ones from those members.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, that I may set forth that reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recollection of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore. When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: then consider, if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and it has only broken the skin; and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately; and do not delay it; and draw from its blood according to the quantity of its strength; if nothing is preventing it from phlebotomy, especially if the blood issuing from the wound is little. And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part. And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
If, however, something prevents lessening, then lessen from food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And if a hot abscess occurs on the wound, apply a poultice steeped in rose oil alone, or with wine containing astringency.
If, however, you are sure it is not a hot abscess, then if the wound is recent with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, apply the powder I will describe shortly; and if the air has already changed it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
If, however, the wound is large, or from a sword cut, and similar things: and its edges do not come together by means of bandages, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their sutures.
If, however, the wound is already exposed by the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspension, then cut it. Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore the hard flesh in place of the skin, and command the sick person to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads [of grain] and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge, and things similar to these.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the putrefied part and cast it off; then treat it.
If, however, in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery. If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a spatula, or tie it. If necessity demands, when what we have said is not helpful, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
If, however, these wounds are small, simple, then their remedy is easy, slight: so that you powder them with this powder, because it consolidates them before the air alters them.
Method of the flesh-growing powder. Take one part of frankincense, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime; grind the whole thoroughly, and sift it; and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it, and clots with the blood.
Then bind it from above with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it as long as it remains, so that it does not fester. For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes lime alone does it, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood present; it also does the same work in many large wounds, when it is appropriate to put it on them and bandage them, and are fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
But if the air has already altered them with some alteration, especially when it is in the time of summer, then the intention of this powder is not in position: therefore treat it with what we have said, so that you put on it some digestive ointments; or put on it poultices made of barley flour, made with water and honey, until they bring out pus. Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
However, if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then remove it with the forceps; and I will now say the treatment of head fractures in what is to come.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment, and between a wound of the head when it is simple.
If, however, the nerve of the neck or artery has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except that its treatment should be avoided with anything that produces a strong astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things. Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
And do not place anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that with which it is treated be mild from medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water, sometimes infused with oil or with rose oil, and tutty, when washed also with sweet water: and the other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
If however the wound is large, then administer a suture: or constrict its lips with plasters. Then treat it until it is healed.
If however the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus is already collected, then pierce it in the more depressed place in it.
If indeed an artery has been incised in the wound, and its blood flow has followed, then separate or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity prompts it.
If however the windpipe has been incised, or the whole of it, and the soft tissues have been saved, then join the lips of the skin with sutures over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe itself, but rather level it and return it to its natural shape. Then bind it with a suitable ligature and leave it for a few days. Then treat it with ointments containing astringency and desiccation, until it is healed.
If however the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it; then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can; and what cannot be removed, leave it until the wound rots, and its exit is separated and eased.
If the wound is recent, then powder over it the powder I have described. If, however, bone is visible in the wound and it becomes a fistula, then treat it with what is mentioned in its chapter.
Concerning a wound in the shoulder blades.
If there is a blow from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider. If, therefore, wind emerges from the wound when the sick person gasps, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if its depth is not great, and it is fresh with its own blood, then do not apply powder to it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person: but apply attractive ointment to it, and loosen it twice daily.
If, however, the ointment is not present for you, then place old cloth in the wound's opening, so that it sucks what emerges from it of the moistures; and cause the sick person to sleep over the wound, so that what gathers in it may run out.
However, if three days or more have already passed since the wound, and no spasm occurs in the sick person, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the rest of his conditions good, then know that the wound is safe. Therefore, treat him with bandages and the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
If, however, his healing is excused, and it always opens up again, then know that it has now become a fistula. Therefore, treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from the cut of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what preceded concerning sutures, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and chipped fragments from it: then investigate the wound, and hasten to remove those fragments, if they are separate. If however, they are not separate, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for the extraction of them will thus be eased.
However, for the treatment of other accidental wounds in the other limbs, the judgment is that which we have said.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
The rupture which occurs in the abdomen is great, medium, and small.
From a great one, therefore, sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Therefore, their intrusion occurs, and their suture is more violent and difficult.
And a small rupture also occurs difficult in a different way. Therefore it follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten their intrusion into their place immediately, because it is inflated, opened, and enlarged, which is why its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore, a middle rupture is better, because when it occurs, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two kinds.
Know that the suture of the belly is according to four ways.
Two common sutures are appropriate for the suture of the belly, and for the suture of the other wounds of the body; and two other sutures are appropriate for the other wounds. However, they are more appropriate when suturing the belly, and I will tell you each one with an explanation and declaration.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine emerges from it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then it is due to one of two methods. Either due to the smallness of the rupture, as we said, or because there is inflation in the intestine due to the cold air.
Therefore, when this is so, then it is necessary to warm it, by soaking a sponge, or a damp cloth, in merely lukewarm water. Or boil it in water with squinanthus, cyperus, and spica, and apply it to the intestine with that, until the inflation resolves.
Sometimes, wine containing astringency does it, and is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow or mallow has been boiled. For through it the entrance of it is eased with a small thing.
If, however, its return is excused after this treatment, then cut slightly into the rupture with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than the incision; and no compulsion to cut is made after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the slender extremity not be with the slenderness of a spatula, but rather somewhat blunter: and it is that which is likened to a caul, as you see.
Therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own proper place, if possible above it; because it is better.
When, however, the rupture is large in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head. And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then have a pious attendant present, who should hold the entire rupture with his hand, and bring together its edges. Then uncover for the one who follows the suture something after something; and this is the common manner of a single suture.
And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles, according to the quantity of the wound's width. Then leave from the extremity of the rupture a quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician's: and fix one needle beyond that, into which you shall insert thread at both ends of the skin, with both ends of the thread that is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread: and four rows are made.
Then tie with the double thread in a circle around the needle several times from both sides together, until the two edges of the wound are brought together in a proper closure.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards pass it with the thread, as you did with the first needle. Therefore do not cease to do that with as many needles as you need, until you complete the closure of the whole wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness, between thick and thin; because very thin needles readily pierce the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to enter the skin; therefore it is necessary that they be of medium thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed too deeply in the two close edges of the skin, lest the flesh be pierced quickly and the wound opened before it has healed, and neither should they be pulled too far with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the sick person during their sleep; and place pads of cloth around them on all sides to hold the needle ends; and leave them until you know that the wound is now healed.
And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds. Because a single needle, or two, or approximately that number, is sufficient for their suture.
However, a second common suture is to bring together four edges: two edges of skin and two edges of the wound, in a single operation, with a needle containing a thread equal in thinness and thickness.
Then, when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, draw the needle back from the side from which you began, so that the thread is drawn taut from the upper part of the wound; so that the suture is like the suture of a cloth where the cloths are drawn together, and place between every suture a quantity of padding the size of a little finger.
However, men know this suture.
And with this suture I treated a wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was greater than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had protruded, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for 24 hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in a space of about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived after that for many years, engaged in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment. Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any medicine, was to be found. Therefore, I placed old linen over the wound twice a day, and diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
I will now describe two specific types of sutures, according to the account of the text.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture, and introduce the needle from the exterior to the interior part.
When, therefore, the needle pierces the skin, and going into the muscle along the length and width of the entire body, leave the end of the thread on the side on which you introduced the needle, and have it penetrate into the other end from the interior to the exterior at the other end miraculously.
When you have caused it to penetrate, then have it penetrate according to this in the same end miraculously from the exterior to the interior; and leave the end of the thread, which is on this side, and cause the needle to penetrate the other end from the interior to the exterior; and have it penetrate with your penetration by which you cause it to penetrate in the miraculously ending thread, which is on its part, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end that is from the thread on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it pierced.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the end of the thread, which is on the other side, with this miraculous end; and withdraw it from the skin that is on its part, and do it once, and again; and do it turn by turn, until you have sewed the whole exterior according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that it should sew the skin like the way leather workers sew skins: so that you should sew the thread once from one side of one end of the skin; and that you should leave it another time from another side, until you complete it.
The second type of proper suture, which Galen said.
His speech recounted that you should sew it according to the way some physicians sew them, so that they join each part to its naturally corresponding partner; and they apply the thread end to its other end, and the needle end to its other end. And that is done according to what I tell you.
You should insert the needle into the nearest needle point on the exterior side, and make it penetrate into the inside of that alone; and leave the two thread ends. Then revolve the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two thread ends, that is, on both sides.
Then revolve both, also making them penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other needle ends, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of stitching is better than the common, easy stitching, and is a stitch whose recall has preceded.
This is therefore also the speech of Galen.
And some said. The stitching of the belly is rectified with two needles. That is, that you introduce one thread in both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from where it is at your hand, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the stitching of those who stitch hides evenly.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its stitching is more difficult than the other parts of the belly.
However, the judgment of the treatment of a wound is like the judgment of other wounds.
That is, because when you get a fresh wound with its own blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine and stitch it up and fit it in place, then place the flesh-forming powder on it.
If the air has already altered the wound, then place upon it certain ointments that are present to you, until they cause pus to form, and the threads fall away, and the wound consolidates by sifac and mirach. Then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it is healed.
However, if the medicines are not present for you, then immediately place upon it, as soon as it begins to discharge pus, old linen: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
For you do not need another medicine in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.
If, however, you fear that the wound might communicate with the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary that you soak soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the parts between the groin and under the armpits.
If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then enema him with astringent, black, lukewarm wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and a penetrating exit has been made to its concavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing, and that which is from the small intestine is of more difficult healing.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nervous nature.
If, however, that which comes forth from the wound is a zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, it has passed a while and has already become green, or black, then it is necessary that you tie it with thread over the spot that has become blackened by it, so that blood flow does not occur. For in a zirbum are veins and arteries.
Then cut that which is beyond the ligament, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the pulling of it might be lightened upon you, and its extraction in the case of the zirbum, and the emission of the wound's pus.
A recollection of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it can be restored in some people.  Because I have seen someone who was wounded in their belly by a lance blow, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and it became a fistula, and expulsion of waste matter and wind came from it.
Therefore, I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until he was healed and the place consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick person, lest some ill accident befall him in his belly; and no such ill accident befell him from that. And he remained in better condition, eating and drinking, and engaging in sexual activity, and entered a bath, and exercised in his daily routines.
And now some experienced persons have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner. And it is, that you should take ants of large heads. Then bring together the two edges of the wound, and place one ant of those that have an open mouth upon the two edges of the wound. When therefore it bites upon them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Then bring it back, and sew the wound. For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is fed, and healed, and no harm befalls the sick person at all.
And now it is possible that the intestine be tied even with a fine thread: which is cleaned from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is to be extensively scraped. Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end. Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew with it the intestine. Then return it to the rupture.
And this method of sewing with ants and intestine is only according to the path of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then there is no remedy except refinement, nor is its healing at all.
Concerning the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus and does not close: then it is universally named a fistula, wherever in the body it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula, truly, is a filtered, hard, white knot, with which there is no pain, having the hollow of a bird's feather: and because of that, some call it Risati, that is, feather.
And in some instances, it is moist, discharging pus. And perhaps the moisture is incised in some instances. And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes scant; and sometimes thick, and sometimes thin.
And I have already mentioned in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that any ulcer that does not heal, nor flesh grows upon it, is not so except for one of nine causes.
Of which one is either due to a deficiency of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh between it and the edges of the ulcer, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there is much uncleanness and dirt; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter discharged to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine used to treat it is unsuitable; or because the corruption present in the region is a form of pestilence, or due to a property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where there is difficulty in the digestion of illnesses and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed; or because there is a single bone, or a number of bones, present in it.
And I have already demonstrated all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division; and it is necessary here to make you aware of the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is accomplished through surgical intervention using the hand.
Therefore, know that Fistula occurs in all the members of the body. For some of them are fistulas which reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews, or the intestine, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs; or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints of composed parts, such as the hand and foot; and of them are some which extend to the vicinity of the principal member and similar ones.
Therefore, whatever of these fistulas is of this kind, is from illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and dealing with it is laborious and ignorant.
If, however, there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at its knowledge, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and investigate it with it.
If, however, there is a winding in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead. Since lead, with the gentleness of its body, is lightened and bends around the winding.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to point to it with a probe. Therefore, irrigate from among its openings.
For the moisture with which you irrigate it goes toward the other openings and runs out through them.
Then inquire carefully in what way it is possible for you to ascertain whether there is a bone, or a nerve, and whether the fistula cavity is distant or close, or whether there is one fistula with many openings.  Stand over the whole of it with all your strength, questioning the patient, and finding the pain from pressure with your hand on the area, and similar signs and causes of accidents and abscesses.
When, therefore, you have stood over all that place properly, then proceed to the treatment with confidence, and consider whether the fistula is a nearby apparent one or in a safe place distant from the joint or nerve or artery or vein or one of the locations I have told you.  Then cut the fistula as previously stated in my account, and remove what is in it through filtration and corrupted flesh, that which grows from the flesh or puss, or similar things. And treat it until it heals.
If however the fistula is of distant depth, and is straight, then you ought to cut it as deeply as possible. Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply bandages soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron implement.  Do this several times, until the sharp medicine has consumed everything remaining in the fistula cavity from the corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it heals.
If however it does not heal by that, then cauterize it as we have described.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed to you, then locate it, and cut it as I told you: if nothing from a vein, or nerve, or main limb prevents you, as we have said.
If therefore bone is found by you, and there is something corrupt and black in it, then scrape it, until all its corruption is removed. Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it heals.
If it does not heal, and emits pus as it did, then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again, and diligently do its scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Then restore it. If it heals, well and good; and if not, then know that the corruption is in a deep, distant part of the body, which you have not reached. Therefore, you have no skill in it, unless you leave it to nature.
If a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suitable for it.
If, however, there are many bones, then carefully draw them all out, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If, however, something from the humours resists you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them: then cut through those humours and flesh, if any are there, and free the bones.
If, however, you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound something that will rot it, and leave it until that which is around those bones from the flesh and humours rots.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal. And constrict the section that you cut in your operation. Indeed, place over it, if you fear, a poultice steeped in crushed sulfur mixed with oil, or a poultice steeped in Egyptian ointment, or some other green ointment.
For when those humours, namely, rot, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and drawing of them is eased.
If however there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or the bone of the hip, and similar to them, and that which is corrupt from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping until that blackness and corruption is removed. Then restore the wound.
If however that which is corrupt in it is a large part, and corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it completely to the place where the corruption has reached; then treat it until it is consolidated.
And I tell you a case, which happened to a man in his leg: that you may put it as an example and aid to your operation.
There was a young man about thirty years of age, to whom pain occurred in his leg, from a cause that arose within his body, that is, from the interior parts, until the matter reached the leg, and it became a large abscess: and there was no external cause.
So, time passed with the physicians' error, until the abscess was opened, and many substances flowed out with it. And his treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it; which all emitted pus and bodily humors.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise man of the art of surgery among them, until I was called, and saw his leg and the matter that flowed from those openings with great force; indeed, the entire body of the man was already putrefying, and his complexion was yellowish.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings, and found that they connected to each other from all parts of the leg.
Therefore, I hastened and cut over one of those openings until I exposed a portion of the bone; and I found it corrupted, already corroded, blackened, and decayed, and perforated until it penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore, I removed what was revealed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I determined that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption which I cut away and removed. And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time. And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted, and I discovered a second layer above the first discovery on the bone: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I cut away what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Then I attempted its restoration. And it was not restored.
Therefore, I again discovered upon it, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut away about one palm's breadth from the bone, and removed it with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except on account of the weakness of the patient's condition, and his small tolerance, and my fear for him regarding death: because it happened to him at all hours, from a superfluity of evacuations, bad syncopes.
Therefore, he was healed with complete healing: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good condition was established in his body, and his strength returned: and he was restored to his former condition: and no harm at all was caused to him in walking.
If, however, a prominent bone in the body has already been fractured, then it is necessary to saw it, in this manner: and thus you should take a bandage and tie it to the end of the prominent bone; and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and place another bandage, thicker than the first, made of wool. Then tie it over the flesh that is beneath the bone; and pull its extremity, so that you draw the flesh downwards; and uncover the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood, or a board, beneath the bone properly from below; because when you do this, it does not prevent the cutting of corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a short time, so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone; and that its appearance does not appear to the senses, and require another sawing of its place.
If the bone is corrupt, and not prominent, but rather its part is continuous with another part; and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all sides completely. Then place the wood below.
Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues to the other part; and let the sawing be along the length of the corruption for a short time, as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues to the other part.
If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no ingenuity in it except abrasion.
If the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the sole of the foot, then the matter is very difficult in it. But you should inquire how the corruption appears to you. And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever ingenuity it is rectified for you, when the vein or nerve does not cause you opposition.
And know that there are many incisions and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument for every type of operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the type of instrument you need, when you have long study with them. And the knowledge of the methods of this art bears witness to the methods of illnesses; for then you will find for yourself what is suitable for it from the instruments for every illness.
And I am firmly establishing for you in the final part of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will place as examples upon which you will cut, and the test by which you will try upon others.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of the razor's joints. Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of a star-shaped nail's head; and its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not fitting, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they are corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Shape of the larger razor.
Shape of the wide razor.
Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Shape of the other, slender razor.
Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Shape of the small, slender, pointed razor.
This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw; it is shown in many places from the cutting of bones.
Shape of the razor suitable for the cutting of that which is perforated from the bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp edges.
It is made of steel. And similarly, it is necessary that all that we have said be made of razors, and knives, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Extremities putrefy, either from an external cause, or from an internal one.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal remedies, and the treatment does not help; and you see corruption seeping into the limb, from which nothing is repelled; then it is necessary that you cut the limb as far as the corruption extends, so that the infirmity escapes from death, or from the greater harm that is in the loss of the limb.
And the sign of this happening is that the limb darkens until it rots; that fire has burned it, or that it rots after the blackness; until that rot is cut away to the point that follows that limb, and it spreads to the entire body.
Therefore, hurry with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the bite of certain poisonous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, and the viper, and the adder, and the like.
If, therefore, the corruption or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to proceed to the rest of the hand.
And similarly, if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it reaches the upper part of the arm.
And if it invades it, then cut the arm at the elbow in its joint.
If, however, the corruption passes, and you see it approximately at the elbow: then in that is the death of the weak one. And to administer beyond that from the cure, is the measure of virtue.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it at one of the joints; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut the entire foot. If however it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
If however the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for dismissal, and leaving the weak one to death.
And the manner of cutting or sawing a limb is that you tighten the ligament below the one you wish to cut, and tighten another ligament above the place. And let the servant extend one ligament downwards, and let the servant extend the other ligament upwards. And you should separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad Spatumili, until the entire flesh is exposed. Then it is to be cut or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloth from all sides, and that the saw does not touch healthy tissue; and that additional injury and a hot abscess befall the sick person.
If, however, an internal flow of blood occurs while you are working, then cauterize the place quickly, or place some blood-stopping powders on it. Then return to your medication until it is complete.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it until it heals.
And I tell you that this same event happened to a man in his foot, the same event which I describe to you.
Because it happened in his foot with a blackness, like a burning that resembles fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Therefore, the man hastened himself, after seeing the corruption strike the limb with its intensity, which he found from its pain and burning: and it struck him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed, the same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
So he came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with what I placed on his hand from medicines after cleansing his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to move to another finger: until the corruption began to spread to his hand.
Therefore, he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from me on the repulsion of that excess: and I also feared for him death from the incision of his hand. Because the man's strength was above the case.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to me about him, that he hurried, and cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought forth this account, except that it may be a help for that which falls under this kind of illness; and that it may be a signification by which to be signified, and according to which to be done.
On the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy limbs, and the space of the abscess extends until it forms a collection of pus; then it bursts, or is perforated, and that which is within it of pus emerges, and an empty space remains as if it were a vessel; and the skin that is over it is like a cloth that has already become thin; and it has not reached the final stage of corruption, nor does it affect the mouth, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula; however, if its space extends until the corruption affects any of these parts, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is to cut away that entire skin as it turns; and especially when it is thin, and made like a cloth; and you are confident that it does not adhere to the area, due to its corruption.
However, if you hope that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not result from that ultimate consequence; and if there is a thickening of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema; and it is to be considered as a Sinus.
Then, if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor, then irrigate it with an Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, to be combined in a vessel; and they should be boiled over fire until the medicine turns red; and it comes to the consistency of honey.
Then take from it as much as you need; and dissolve it with water and honey, and irrigate the Sinus with it; and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for a period of two hours.
Then extract it with pressure; do this for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is irrigated with ash water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is as if you take the ash of vine wood, or ash from the wood of holm oak; and pour water over it. Then strain it, and irrigate with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed clean.
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then irrigate it with water and honey, to which some crushed ziniar has been added. Or irrigate it with honey and wine mixed, since the property of honey is to cleanse and wash away; and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed, then irrigate it with that which causes flesh to grow there.
And it is to take from the diafinicon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or irrigate it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that the clyster tube does not enter, then enlarge it slightly with iron; or place a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment, upon it, until it is enlarged.
And similarly, if the opening is even wide, then bring together its lips with a suture, and leave the quantity in which the clyster enters without addition.
And similarly, if the opening from which pus runs is elevated upward, then cut it in the lower place within it, so that the pus runs downward; because when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus approximately below it as you wish, then try to prepare the member in a way that the pus runs out of it with ease as you have prepared it. Try to keep nothing of the pus in it at all, and take the consolidating medicines that are placed on the sign, suitable for what you wish. And spread them out over a linen cloth. And let the cloth be of such a size that it covers the entire sinus. Then cut with scissors a hole in the direction of the sinus opening, a little larger than the sinus opening. Then spread mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over the first, some distance from the sinus opening, so that the discharge of pus from it is relieved; and do not remove the large cloth, unless after a few days at a time.
However, the one over the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it from pus may come out; and so that you may know whether the matter flowing from it, the pus, is much or little, or digested or undigested.
And with this, again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain there, or if there is no pain there, and whether there is an abscess there, or if there is no abscess there.
When, therefore, your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the matter which emerges from the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or is approaching adherence; then, therefore, loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth and renew the ointment.
If, however, thin matter emerges from the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
If, however, undigested pus emerges from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the matter prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, but let the physicians make them such that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their power; such as the ointment dyafinicon, when superfluity of addition is added to it from zegi.
And from the most ultimate in its treatment, is that you take the ointment dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle upon it old wine equal in its substance.
Then prepare it with that, and use it.
And similarly to this action, when the ointment dyafinicon is not present for you, use honey when you boil it until it thickens, and use it. Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is on the fire. Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus: and line with the honey that you have boiled until it has thickened: and powder spices over it, and place it over the cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the heavenly lily, and the lily, and the herb's flour, and centaury, are administered in it. Use them, simple or compounded, grind them, and sieve them: and powder them over the honey that I have mentioned, and use it.
If the sinus persists and is not healed by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it: or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of Fistulas, as was previously mentioned.
Concerning the treatment of whitlow and a worn nail, and the incision of an added finger, and section.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps arises on the other fingers.
When therefore its condition is prolonged and its treatment neglected, and it becomes an abscess with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foul odor from it: and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Therefore, when you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you cut with an iron all the superfluity that remains from the nail. Then cauterize the wound after that. For cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail also healthy, and the useless additions of the nail now press the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin Radius under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut the flesh with ease, and place upon that which remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until the whole of it is removed. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If however corruption has already penetrated into the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract it: for it will never be healed while corrupted bone remains within it.
If, however, you see corrosion and corruption entering the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to its previous description. Then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, a nail suffers attrition, or impact, and a severe pain results, then it is necessary to first bleed the afflicted person. Then cut the nail with a sharp Spatumil in a transverse cut from above, as you see.
And guard that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause intense pain to the afflicted person through that, and it will be the cause for the generation of added flesh in that place.
Then treat the place with that which soothes pain.
The extra finger that is born in some human hands, perhaps is entirely fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps a nail is in it; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some nodes of the finger. Therefore, the one that is born in some nodes of the finger, does not move; and the one that is born near the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Therefore, the incision of the one that is fleshy among them is easy. That is, cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of the one whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult. Therefore, abstain from its incision.
In that one, however, which is born on the finger at the last joints, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh with a round incision, down to the bone. Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it. Then treat it until it is healed.
However, the consolidation that happens between fingers often occurs either from the birth of a person, that is, it is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or the burning of fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape. Then place between them bandages, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them; or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the place consolidates as it should.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, as is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of a defect.
Ulcers are enveloped, thick veins, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many members of the body; and their effect is most often in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel, work, and carry burdens.
Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body from black bile, occasionally with a strong purge.
Then, bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, their treatment with iron is according to two methods. One of them is that they should be cut, and the black blood extracted. And the other method is that the vein should be raised and the whole thing extracted.
However, its incision is according to this method. First, soak the leg in much hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved. Then bind the leg of the sick person from the upper part of his thigh, up to the lower part of his knee with a bandage. Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then elevate, that is, draw the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg up, and from the upper part it is necessary that the phlebotomist first treats the sick person. Then cut the nail further down: until an amount of blood comes out that you see sufficient, and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
Afterwards, tie it off; and order him to abstain from foods that produce black bile; and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are filled and that harms the patient.
However, its elevation is in this manner. Shave the patient's leg if there are many hairs on it. Then immerse him in a bath; or apply a poultice of warm water to his leg until it reddens, and the veins swell; or have him exercise strenuously, if a bath is not available, until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein: either at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein from all sides until it appears to the senses: and at its appearance, you see it sloping from red to black. When it emerges from the skin, you see it white, like a string.
Then introduce a probe under it, until when it is raised and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Then make another incision near that incision, by three fingers. Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears. Then raise it with probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need them. Then raise, and cut it at the very last incision, near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision that is above it.
And do that until you pull it out from the incision that is higher, or from all the higher incisions, until the whole of it emerges; then cut it.
If however it does not yield to you in pulling and lifting it, then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod under it, and turn your hand in every direction until it comes out. And be careful not to cut it. For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and enters upon the weak one from it harm.
When therefore you have pulled it out entirely, then place on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and treat it until it is healed.
If the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is a wrapping to parts, and is not as we said according to straightness, then it is necessary that you cut it on every part of its twisting and its wrapping places.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you lift it entirely: and be careful at your cut on it not to cut a vein, or wound it, for it will be difficult for you to lift or extract it. Therefore, preserve your prudence.
Form of the incident by which the vine is healed.
Form of the blind hook.
It does not have the curvature like the other hooks, nor is its extremity sharp, so as not to wound a vein: and it is of a thick, flexible nature, smooth; because if it were thin, it would cut a vein by its thinness: indeed, let its thickness be superfluous, as we said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in legs in hot lands, such as Al-Jazirah and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little tenderness, that is, in those in which no grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, ascarids, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg. Then the place becomes blistered. Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant or animal.
Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary to wrap a piece of lead around it, whose weight is from one drachma keil up to two drachmas, and tie it; and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it. If it extends a great deal, then cut part of it and wrap the remainder. And do not cut it at the root before the whole of it emerges. Because if you cut it, it shrinks, and enters into the flesh; and it causes an abscess, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be gently handled and drawn out gradually until it emerges from its last part, and nothing of it remains in the body; and from this vein indeed, in some men, that which is in its length emerges five palms and ten. And now it has reached me, that it emerged from a man of twenty palms.
If however it is incised upon your time of medication, then insert a rod into its opening and pierce it with a long opening, along with the body, until the entirety that is in it is evacuated from the material; and administer treatment for the putrefaction of the place with medicaments for some days. Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot or in the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Therefore treat it, as we said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
Concerning the incision upon worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Disease of cattle.
This illness is named in a certain land among us the Disease of cattle; because it frequently happens to oxen, and is a small single worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending; and its passage from limb to limb is perceptible to the senses, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors. As happen worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and threadworms, in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice. Because when it travels within the body, and ascends to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens there, and emerges, and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Therefore, when one wishes to treat it, and to extract it, then this is not done except by its movement, and its appearance to the sense.
Therefore, it is necessary that you tie that which is above it, and that which is below it with a strong constricting ligature. Then cut above it, and extract it.
If it penetrates deep into the flesh, and you do not find it: then place a cautery with fire on the area, until it dies.
And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
If, however, you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then tie below it the eyebrow with a good ligature. Then cut above it, and extract it.
And it is necessary that the sick person use cleansing of his body, with medicines that dissolve bad, putrid humours.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
Concerning the incision above the ailment of Nakir.
This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs; then it changes from limb to limb.
And indeed I myself have already seen it, as I tell you. I was called to a woman infirm in certain villages. And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling moving with the pulse, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible; like quicksilver running from place to place.
Therefore, the pain receded from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it was rolling throughout her whole body, as I had seen.
Therefore, I was amazed at the speed of its movement from limb to limb. And I myself, before that, had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way, in this manner. However, I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb, and I have not seen it with my own eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is otherwise than because the woman was from among those whose bodies are dry, with detected veins; therefore, this windiness appears to the senses, shifting.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this manner in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, with hidden veins.
When therefore you wish to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to you with the eye, as we have said, then pinch above it, and below it quickly, and cut above it, until that confined windiness emerges, and cauterize the place.
If however you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with shaking the body, and with that which expels windinesses, and mitigates them with foul pills, and pills of serapion, and similar ones.
Concerning the extraction of Arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their kinds, and according to the places where they fall from the body.
Their diversity is, however, because some have large points, and small ones: and concave, and blunt. And some of them have three angles. And some of them have tongues. And some of them have stars.
Those, however, which are according to the members on which they fall, are according to two ways. For either the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar to them. Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I relate to you afterward, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions. And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and exits through the thin membrane that is over the brain, are: because intense headache, and blindness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera, occur from it. And perhaps blood exits from the nostrils, or ears. And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed. And a white moisture like gruel comes out of the wound location. And from it comes out something similar to the watery part of flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that one feels as though it were fixed in a hard substance, not in an empty one. And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the pulse's movement; and black blood runs from the wound. And this is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting. Know therefore, that death descends without a doubt.
And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels that follow the neck become inflamed, and the sick person's color changes. And he exhales a large, deep breath; and he seeks the inhalation of cold air.
If an arrow should strike the covering, which is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and a great breath is taken with violent pain, with a gasp, and all the shoulder limbs move.
And if an arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps undigested food will issue from the wound.
And if an arrow strikes the belly and is fixed in it, something of the excrement, or a zirb, or an already ruptured intestine, will emerge from the wound. Therefore, there is no hope of curing him, nor of extracting the arrow.
If an arrow strikes the bladder, and urine emerges, and something issues forth from it to the exterior, and the pain is more severe upon the sick person, then know that it is mortal.
However, the remaining members, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder blade, arm, spine, ribs, hip, leg, and similar members are saved in various ways, when the arrow does not strike an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I have seen regarding these arrows, so that you may understand your treatment through it.
Because an arrow struck a man's tear duct, at the root of his nose. Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, beneath the fat of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid.  The arrow was already hidden, and I only retrieved a small tip of it, with which it was attached to its shaft.  And it was a large arrow from the Turkish bows, with soft iron, on which there were no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no misfortune happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arab arrow, and it is of the kind which has ears. Therefore, I cut above it between the two gullets: and it was already submerged in his throat. Therefore, I worked delicately with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly, and we thought that he would die from it.
Therefore, after thirty days had passed over him, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow, and I worked upon it, and extracted it; and he was healed, and no harm befell him.
And I saw a man upon whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound above it had healed. Therefore, after seven years, an arrow emerged at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman upon whose belly an arrow had fallen, and the wound above it had healed, and the arrow remained inside her; and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman experienced no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, upon whose face an arrow had fallen; and the wound healed, and it remained, causing him not much pain; and many similar cases to these.
And I extracted an arrow from the King's chief men, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, and had already slightly inclined to the right side; and the entire arrow was hidden.
Therefore, I was summoned for his treatment after the arrow's impact for up to three days. Therefore, I found the arrow wound very tight.
Therefore, I searched for it with a fine probe, and did not feel it; and he himself found a prick and pain under his right ear. Therefore, I hoped that the prick was from the arrow's tip.
Therefore, I plastered the area with a plaster containing attractive and digestive properties, confident that the area would form an abscess, and that the arrowhead would appear, so that I could cut over it; and no sign occurred at the location to indicate that the arrow had impacted the place.
Therefore, I applied the plaster to him for many days; and no sign occurred, and the wound meanwhile healed; and he remained weak from the extraction for a space of days, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose. And he told me that.
And he told me that. Therefore, I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, I felt a fine arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead appeared to us visibly; and I spent approximately four months with him during this time.
Then, after the wound had widened, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to removal, I did not cease to refine and devise methods for it, until I began one day, using specially crafted forceps, in the form described at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it. Then I repaired the wound.
And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored. Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the sick man was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
And I tell you the nature of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may establish a rule and meaning for what I have not said.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed within the narrative, nor does the book encompass it, and a skillful craftsman compares the little with the much, and with what is present with what is absent, and finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descent of foreign things of this art when they happen.
Therefore, I say that arrows do not emerge from the limbs in which they are fixed except in two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered. Or by the contrary of the other part.
And that which emerges from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and is pulled out, and emerges.
If it does not yield to exit from the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary to leave it for a number of days, until the flesh that is around it rots, and its traction is eased, and its exit.
And similarly if it is fixed in the bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for a number of days, and repeatedly with traction and motion every day, until it emerges.
If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow is enlarged. Then pull it, and extract it.
If however the arrow is now hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sense, then seek it with probes. If however you feel it, then pull it out with certain instruments that are suitable for pulling it out.
If however you cannot grasp it, due to the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep within; and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then widen around it, until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
If however there are ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side, by every means you can, and try, if it is not possible to remove the flesh from the fractured or twisted ears, until it escapes.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps, to all sides, until you make it escape: and be subtle in the utmost subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
If you cannot remove it within one hour, then leave it for several days, until what is around it rots. Then try again: for it will be easier then.  But if a flow of blood gives you trouble, then administer what we have said regarding treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And use every means possible to extract the arrow: and let it be with ease and calmness, or with slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary, when you pull out the arrow, that it be weakened according to the shape in which the arrow was lodged. Because it is more helpful. If however it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
However, an arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either already protrudes from it outward, or causes a swelling on the arrowhead, by feeling, on the surface of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding; therefore, cut over it, and let the incision be according to the size that the forceps can hold.
Then pull it out; for it becomes easy to remove.
However, if it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion, until the arrow imprints itself in the bone, and enlarges itself, then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days; then try again until it comes out.
If the arrow's shaft is in it, then push it out with it.
If however the shaft has fallen away, and you wish to administer a push, then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it out with it.
If however the arrow is concave, then push it out with an instrument entering it. For the arrow is eased by it.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you cauterize all the flesh where the poison is, if it is possible for you. Then treat it with whatever is suitable for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and is close to that which you touch with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and be careful of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then sew up the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the extremities be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
And many types of them are made, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity, size, and smallness of the arrow, and the breadth and constriction of the wound.
The shape of the impelling concave.
And the shape of the impelling blunt.
This is a blunt extremity, like a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be impelled with it.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
There are thirty veins to be opened, whose course is customary in the body.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called two Herbs; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called Looking; and the prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and the vein which is at the tip of the nose. And two Guidegi, which are in the neck. And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins which are in the lower lip. And these are veins called Algecherich. And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, however, that are bled in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side: and the common people call it the vein of the head. And Fusca. And it is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body. And Basilic, and it is situated on the domestic side: and it is also called Titillicaris. And the common people call it the vein of the belly. And the arm's cord, and it is situated above the elbow: and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with manifest appearance.
And Saluatella: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and foot there are three veins. One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb from the wild side. And the second is Saphena: and its place is at the heel from the domestic side. And the vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel from the wild side.
And in the other leg are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are beneficial for old colds, and for hemiplegia, and for sahafati, and for old, bad head ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is as I describe. And it is as if the sick person's head is shaved, and his occiput is rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth by good rubbing. Then let the sick person tighten his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear. And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head. Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark that place with ink.
Then take a phlebotomous knife, and it is called the incisor. Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the phlebotomous reaches the opening. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin with an incisive incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or approximately that: and make as much blood come out as you wish.
Then bind it with bandages, and leave it until it heals.
And already in the beginning of the book was the incision of those [things] and their cauterization.
The phlebotomy of the two arteries, which are in the two temples, is beneficial for ancient hemiplegia; and for crooked speech, and constant ophthalmia; and for a flow of excessive acute discharges to the eyes.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you. Let the sick person stretch his neck greatly, until two veins appear clearly to the senses, and their pulse is shown under your finger. Then mark them with ink.
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards. And cut it, as you did in the other two veins: and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then release the constriction of the sick person, and place your finger on the vein for one hour. Afterwards place a bandage and pads on it, and bind it tightly above the constriction: and release it until it is healed.
And already the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction have gone before in the beginning of the book.
Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein is after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, for the old ailments of the face, and for hemicrania, and redness, and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you. The sick man binds his neck with a bandage until the vein appears. Then take the instrument which is called the Fossorium.
Place the prominent point which is on the head of the Fossorium over the vein itself, and strike it with a scraper, or with something else in its manner; and let the blood run according to the quantity that you wish. Then loosen the wound of the sick person, and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotom. However, it should not be a phlebotom with a sharp end, like the other phlebotoms, but rather with a broad end. And lance it across, because the bone is close by, and perhaps the phlebotom will break in it when it is slender.
The relief of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes is for the eye from scabies and redness, and for a speck in the eye, and for ailments of the face.
And the quality of their lancing is such that the weak man tightens his neck with a bandage. Then lance them, and you be standing over his head.
And let the lancing be across, a little lengthwise, with a small lancet, somewhat broad, for there is no flesh in the place. For if the lancet is of a slender tip, it might perhaps break.
Then let the blood run as much as you need. And place a bandage over them, and bind them one night, and unbind them.
The lancing of the veins of the Nose is helpful in acute fevers, and violent headaches, and illnesses of the face, such as migraine, and redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is longstanding.
And the quality of its bloodletting is such that the weak man tightens his own neck. Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet, and stick it into the middle of his nostril, between that which separates the nose according to its straightness. Because the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the lancet for a little while, and cause the blood to flow according to your need. Then tie it with a bandage. For it (the wound) will recover quickly.
Indeed, the benefit of the phlebotomy of Guidegi's two veins is for the constriction of breathing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and evil ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, shingles.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that the weak man should be restrained beneath both (veins) on his neck with a bandage: and the craftsman should stand over the sick person's head, and the sick person should be seated on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist should lance the vein to a length, the incision wide for a short time. Then extract a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see as necessary for that. Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and tie the two veins with a middle-level constriction, so that the sick person is not choked. And leave it until morning. For the wound is healed.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins, Algeberich. Veins, however, in Algeberich's phlebotomy are helpful: because they contribute to ulcers in the mouth, and gum corruption; and bad ulcers; and lip fissures, and bad ulcers, even those in the nose and around it.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is, that you should make the infirm person sit before you; and tie his neck with a bandage. Then turn back his lip, and look at the two veins: of which one is to the right of the lip, and the second to its left; and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of both. And that is true, because around them are small, black veins. Therefore, cut each with an incision proceeding.
However, if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then aim at the incision of the larger of them, and the more evident of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed most custom is with it: and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Of phlebotomy Of the vein under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein. However, the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is that the phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for the suffocations that are in the throat, and the ailments of the uvula, and the ailments of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is such that the sick person should sit between your hands before the sun; and lift up his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it a vein, and on the other side of it a vein; and the colour of both of them should slope towards blackness.
Therefore, phlebotomize each of them; and beware lest you press your hand too hard when phlebotomizing them. For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will come from those arteries.
The three veins, however, which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those whose phlebotomy has become customary in all people.
And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods. Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome, or a sharp olive-shaped one, or by cutting with a knife phlebotome, and it is Alnesil. And this is its form.
And from them are broad and narrow types according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle phlebotome should be broad, as you see. And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of smaller width and finer extremity.
And it is suitable for the venesection of slender veins, which contain thin, yellow blood.
The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is an aid in venesection. Because it draws blood from illnesses that are beneath the throat and neck, from what follows the chest, and the abdomen; and it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when performing the venesection on it, to be cautious and be wary of it, for there is an artery beneath it. If, therefore, he errs and adds to the venesection puncture, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will result. Therefore, it is necessary not to venesect it with a venesection lancet; rather, one should cut it with a scalpel.
If the Basilic vein is not clearly visible, then one should seek another vein, and switch to another, or look for one of its branches; or venesect the Brachial vein instead. For it is indeed evident, and cut it with the scalpel, as we said.
If, however, you wish to venesect it (the same vein), then it is necessary, before constricting the arm, to touch the area until you know the location of the pulse. Then mark the spot with a marking ink, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using a scalpel, as we said. And be careful that the blow does not fall over the space from the artery location.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, inflation in the spot you marked with the marking ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
If you see blood at the venesection leap, like a child's urine, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the artery's blood. Then quickly place your finger over it a long space, then remove your finger. If, therefore, blood is cut (for it is often cut), then tighten the arm, and release it: and let the sick person beware of its movement; and let it be upon their fear.
And let him not move it for some days, until it is healed.
If, however, the blood is not cut, and overcomes you, and there is no medicine present at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you. For its extremities contract, and the blood is cut.
Or take the bark of the fig-tree, and split it: take one half, and tie it over the place of the vein with a decent tightening, with a bandage and lint until another day.
Then if the blood is cut, it is good. And if not, then treat it with that whose prior recollection was from the place of the powders cutting the flow of blood: and the cutting of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
The phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we said.
And it befits the phlebotomist that it be above the fear from its phlebotomy, for a nerve is beneath it. Therefore, if the phlebotomist adds to the puncture, and finds a nerve, there occurs in it a stupor, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed.
And this nerve often appears to the senses. However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and not shown, then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy in such a way as to phlebotomize it, a section with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, then divide the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the cephalic vein. Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to ailments of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-wood phlebotome, or with a myrtle-wood phlebotome, because it is the safest of all veins, because it is not beneath an artery, nor a nerve.
However, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy, that you avoid with the phlebotome the head of the muscle only, and seek a gentler place; and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first puncture, so that it may be repeated upon it with phlebotomy several times.
However, perhaps it becomes suppurated in some people when it is not phlebotomized on the first puncture, but that suppuration does not harm it in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it. However, the quality of phlebotomy, and its resulting accidents, are matters on which you should reflect.
First, you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and its persistence, and precaution against the arrival of illnesses.
And so that phlebotomy is done on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilic. And that phlebotomy be done in the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in Spring and Summer; and in Autumn and Winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the first, or third, day, after three hours have passed since the previous day.
However, phlebotomy administered in illnesses does not have a determined time; but when the appropriateness and necessity for it arises, in the night, or day, and at any hour, and at any time.
And it is not necessary that children be bled until they reach fourteen years of age. Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month. Nor should the elderly be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled, for whatever reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained feces in them, so that the veins do not draw putrid superfluities harmful to the main members from the intestines during the phlebotomy.
Nor should a patient be bled who is suffering from nausea, or who is surfeited, or escaping from intoxication, until that is removed from them. Nor should the sick with dropsy.
And phlebotomy should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, and an abundance of sexual intercourse, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything that dissolves strength from the bodily or animal constitution.
Then consider the subtlety of the humours before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him.
Then he should enter a bath, if nothing prevents him: or he should exercise with some exercise, so that the blood is refined.
And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and endeavor that his chest be emptied that day from all bad animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and punishment, and excessive intercourse, and those similar to them.
And let him have present things, with whose use the custom of men has run, from aromatics, and scents, and festivities, and things similar to them, in as much quantity as possible.
Then the phlebotomist should sit on a cushion, which is higher than the phlebotomist's cushion: afterwards, he should pull out his arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with his hand twice, or thrice. Then he should tie the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal, or by excess in the constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood: or in its loosening, then it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then, after the constriction, the phlebotomist should rub his hands together until the veins swell and are apparent to the senses.
Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil, properly.
Then he should place his left index finger slightly over the vein itself, under the place where he wishes to phlebotomize, so that the vein does not flee and the blow is not missed. Because there are veins which are like a fleeing chord when phlebotomizing, and there are those which are full of windiness, and when you place the phlebotome upon them, they contract beneath the phlebotome, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is constricted.  Therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and careful in all these things.
Then he should lay down the phlebotome. If therefore the vein opens at once, then it is good. And if not, then repeat it another time under that place slightly, or above it with haste, if the place is not ulcerated.
If, however, it becomes ulcerated, or the patient becomes weak, then leave him for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage. For perhaps it will attract a hot ulcer. Nor shall he enter a bath.
Then he should repeat the bloodletting, if he desires.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the desired quantity will not drain from the blood, then repeat the bloodletting at the same spot, following the natural line, and add a little to the operation.
And do it quickly, before the place becomes ulcerated, for a small incision will result in an ulceration in many people.
If therefore you see it already ulcerated, then do not repeat the procedure on it at all, for it will not benefit you in any way. And place something of olive-oil dregs upon it, because it alleviates the flow of blood. And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly, administer olive-oil dregs in all your phlebotomies, when you want to prevent the flow of blood: and the Tyrian, alfarach, and sagzenea do this, when one of them is placed over the site.
For blood is made thinner and dissolved when it is thick.
If a large abscess occurs at the phlebotomy site, for this frequently happens, especially to someone who is not a phlebotomist except on that occasion, or if the vein opening is small, then quickly place a sponge soaked in warm water and salt over the area, and bind it for one hour, because it will resolve.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has flowed from the vein itself, when it is full, or from another vein.
If some blackness or greenness remains in the area after a few days, that does not harm it; and if you wish, place some dissolved aloe or myrrh over it, or something from the juice of mint, that is, balm, or something similar.
And frequently abscesses and swellings do occur at the Basilica phlebotomy.
Therefore, place your hand over it; then, if you find softness upon your compression over it, that swelling is bad. Therefore, be careful to place something of what we have said upon it. For perhaps blood will flow from it, of the artery.
But make a plaster on it with that in which is astringency, so that the place may be hardened. Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its virtue. And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it exit until it turns red; and likewise if you see it thick, then let it exit until it becomes thin; and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting at once, that the vein's incision be widened, and the phlebotomist be broad-minded; and in one who is weak, it be contrary to this.
And it is necessary that he extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and better that which is administered in the bloodletting of the vein is that it be a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from blood flow, and from nerve incision; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting by breadth and length.
And to whome it is accustomed to come to bloodletting syncope, it is necessary that he eat beforehand a moderate portion of bread soaked in pomegranate juice water; or secaniabin, if it is heated; and extract from him blood in three stages, or four.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take, before bloodletting, bread soaked in quince syrup, or in syrup of aromatized honey with spices, or in fragrant aromatized syrup.
If syncope occurs during bloodletting, and its cause is the outflow of much blood, then it is necessary that he drink water from meat, and a subtle fragrant syrup; and let him use aromatics with allay, and let his chest be lined with it; and let him use the rest that we have said in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
However, whoever wishes to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to release the blood gradually, according to the amount of strength, over consecutive days.
However, whoever wishes to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then let them do it after seven hours, or nine, from their first bloodletting.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from their body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that they be evacuated on the second or third day.
In whose body, however, there is much blood already heated, and sharp, and causing fever, it is necessary that blood exit from it in one turn, and a large quantity be drawn out of it; and the opening be increased until syncope occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and that you place your hand upon his pulse near the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope. For often that happens, when the bloodletter is ignorant and negligence occurs.
And it is not fitting, when you wish to release the arm and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein has already closed and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that you press upon it with vehemence and rapidly stretch or bend it. For that is very harmful; indeed, leave it until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with sharpness the blood clot from the opening of the vein, and place upon it some dissolved salt in water. And place upon it something of theriac alfaroch, or sagzenea, and apply gentle pressure until the blood emerges.
If, however, the vein has already become suppurated, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess has subsided.
If, however, necessity compels the drawing of blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either bleed it above that spot, or in another arm in another vein.
However, the arm's vein is to be bled at the place of the Cephalic and Basilic veins, when these are not found and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
And the quality of the bloodletting is such that the infirm person should immerse their hand in warm water until the skin reddens, and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then it should be tied above it with a ligature of moderate constriction. Then bleed it according to a transverse incision gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise; and let the opening be wide, and your incision should be over the joint of the hand for a short while.
If the flow of blood is obstructed, then immerse the hand again in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into the water until you achieve your goal.
However, if you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from re-immersion of the hand in warm water. And indeed, the course of blood is mostly placed in warm water in the time of winter.
And the incision of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should constrict the mahason hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells, and is very clearly apparent to the senses. Then incise it transversely. And if you cut it completely, that will not harm it at all.
And be careful not to cut your hand with the lancet. For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers laid bare of flesh.
Then apply the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it. For if you do not apply it to warm water, the blood clots in the vein's opening and is prevented from flowing.
When you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then put oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not clot quickly.
And similarly, it is necessary to do so with every constricted branch.
Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen; and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second equally.
However, the benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the method of his phlebotomy is that the sick person should put his foot in warm water, and make friction upon it until the veins swell, and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap. And indeed the vein's location is at the heel, appearing towards the big toe; and branches from it fan out into many branches on the foot's surface.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or at the heel in its gathering; because it is better and safer.
If one phlebotomizes it on the foot's surface, then beware of the nerves which are beneath it upon the foot's surface.
And place your phlebotomy so that you phlebotomize it across, as if you wish to cut it; and let the phlebotomist be careful.
If, however, the flow of blood is obstructed, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood flow into it, until it is evacuated.
If the phlebotomist errs in the first instance, then let him repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The Sciatic vein's location, as we have said, is at the heel on the wild side.
And phlebotomy is a help for the pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter a bath and hurry; and let him tighten his leg from the side of the hip up to the heel by four fingers, with a long thin bandage; for it does not appear except on account of that.
Therefore, when it appears, then the phlebotomist should cut it according to whatever ability is possible for you, or according to the transverse method; and it is better either that you cut it with an incision or that you sever it with a section. For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people. If, however, you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all, then the phlebotomist should cut any branch of it, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot and toward the ankle; and beware of the nerves, and make the blood run in whatever quantity you wish.
Then release the constriction, and place a skin over the phlebotomy site, and tighten the location. For it quickly heals.
Concerning Cupping, and the quality of its use.
Cupping instruments are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
And cupping indeed is done according to two methods. With scarification, and extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods. Or indeed it is with fire. Or it is without fire.
And cuppings that are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen locations on the body. Of which one is, cupping Alnocrati, and it is the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck; and cuppings Alhagdahim, and they are two blades of the neck at both sides together; and cuppings menti, and it is under the jaw in the lower mouth; and cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and cuppings Alachosos at the end of the tail; and cuppings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and cuppings of the two thighs; and cuppings of the two calves.
And cupping indeed does not extract blood from you from small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that no power is lost from them, just as is the case in phlebotomy. Nor should cupping, whether with fire or without fire, be administered in any illness that arises from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
If necessity prompts cupping from illness or for custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
This is because there are people in whom when blood multiplies in it, until it needs its extraction by cupping, finds heaviness and throbbing in their head.
And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. And among them are those who find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And among them is one who scratches the site of their cupping. And among them is one whose laughter multiplies. And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue becomes suppurated, and spits out blood. And among them is one whose sleep multiplies. And among them is one who sees in their sleep blood and redness, and slain ones, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the third middle of the month, we then order venesection to be performed, after two or three hours have passed of the day.
The benefit of venesection of the nape of the neck is: because it contributes to heaviness in the head, and that which flows to the eyes. However, it is necessary that it be after evacuation of the whole body.
And this venesection is in the place of a cephalic phlebotomy.
And it is not permitted for one of cold complexion, or in whom there is a cold, to use it. For it brings him great harm.
And because of that, old people and those with cold ailments in their heads should not use it.
But whoever is habitually over it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
And because of that, you should instruct the wind-dresser to lay his hand a little lower with the wind-pipe, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Wind-dressing, or Alkehel, is in the place of dark phlebotomy and basilica phlebotomy, and because of that it benefits asthma, and constriction of breathing, and fissure of the breathing instrument, and cough, and repletion.
And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping be moved a little, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Wind-dressing of the hagdahīm benefits accidental pains in the head, and ophthalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of basilica phlebotomy.
And it is necessary to instruct the wind-dresser not to press his hand with the scarification so that he does not cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Wind-dressing under the chin benefits sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth: and it stands in the place of other phlebotomies that are on the two lips.
Wind-dressing of the shoulder blades benefits alchafacham, which results from flexion and heat.
Wind-dressing of the inner parts of the two flanks benefits the relief of phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilic, and Fusca, and Cephalic: because it draws blood from all the small veins that are in the flesh; and those small veins draw from other larger veins, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
And it is necessary that you instruct the wind-dresser not to proceed too far in the scarification, because the place is deprived of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
A cupping applied over the alchazos benefits hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the wind-dresser that the cupping be large and that it be made of air, because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the delicate cuppings break; and it should be scarified with a large scarification.
Cupping of the legs reduces swelling noticeably, because they draw blood from the entire body and benefit old pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; they provoke menstruation, and benefit botor, and ademenul; and they take the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
And the benefit of alhorcobeni cupping is close to the benefit of cupping the two legs.
The quality of placing cupping is that you should place the cupping initially empty, and suck with moderate suction; and do not prolong the placement of the cupping, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with equal arrival; and do not cease to repeat this and continue, until you see the place already red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears; then, therefore, scarify, and repeat the suction gradually. Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
For those who are of tender flesh, of rare pores, it is necessary to scarify him once, no more: so that the place is not ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to enlarge the scarification a little, and to deepen it slightly; and to moderate the suction with ease, speed, and gentle movement.
If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify him twice. Indeed, in the first instance, the way is opened to the thinning of the blood and its becoming watery; and in the second instance, to the searching out of the exquisite extraction of thick blood.
If, however, the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be done a third time, so that the final result may be achieved.
And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little bit, one scarification is enough for us. If we wish to extract much blood, we scarify with many scarifications.
And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification; and the equal limit in the scarification is the depth of the skin.
What is that which ought to be administered from the oils at the application of the Cupping-glasses, and what should the cupper beware of.
In that one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary that the places to be cupped be anointed with oils that are opening, softening, and dissolving: if it is in the time of summer, such as the oil of alkeiri, or bruised oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seed.
And if it is in the time of winter, then the oil of narcissus, or the oil of lily, or the oil of camomile, or sarbatic oil, and similar to these.
If however the superfluity is thick, cold: then the oil should be amaranth oil, or oil of balsam, or oil of alben, or oil of dill, and similar to these.
If however the cupper is of wide pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary that he abstain from oil, and it is necessary that they wash the places of the cuppings after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with water of solatri, or with pumpkin water, or with purslane water, and similar to these.
However, he whose blood is of much moisture, should wash the cuppings with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac, and similar to these.
However, whose superfluities are thick, let him wash his cuppings with old wine, or with water of samsuci, or with a decoction of dill, or camomile, and similar to them.
And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in a bath, or in the vicinity of a bath; rather, it is necessary that it be administered after exiting the bath by the hour, or by two hours.
And it is not necessary that someone sleep after cupping.
What is it that should govern a Ventosandus, or Phlebotomist, before cupping?
And after it, it is necessary to consider first: if the cupper, or phlebotomist, is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation overcome his blood: then it is necessary that he take refrigerants, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and iuleb, and similar to them.
And put his food as chickens, and the flesh of sheep sekebiget, and foods seasoned with agrimony; and similar to them.
And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds; and he should take medium fragrant wine, which is between old and new; and it is prescribed that he use a small amount of food. And put his food as chickens, and canary birds, and sparrows, that is, small birds, and young doves issiadebet.
And it is necessary that the drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting be more than the food; and it is necessary that in some men, in the hours of tyriaca alfaroch, or a medicine of musk, that is, musk, or alesselithe, be given in the drink before the cupping; and before or after bloodletting, so that the principal members are strengthened, and the blood is refined. And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
Of cupping without scarification. However, cupping that is without scarification, is cupping that is placed upon the liver, and the spleen, and gout, and upon the belly, the navel, and the places of the kidneys, and the chest of the lungs; because these members do not endure scarification upon themselves.
And they are not sought for unless there is either an adhesion of blood from one limb to another limb; like when we place cupping on the nipples in the sickness of nosebleeds. And we use them to loosen cold, viscous wind from a limb; like when we place cupping on the belly and the navel. For it rarefies the limb and heats it, and removes pain because it dissolved that wind.
It is also placed upon the kidneys when obstruction or stone occurs in them. For by its power of attraction perhaps it opens the obstruction or uproots the stone from its place.
And similarly it does when placed upon the liver and spleen, in the case of wind to be crushed in either.
And these cupping vessels are administered empty, with only incision. And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in cases of pleurisy; and that is, that the cupping vessel be filled, and be large, with only warm water, or water in which herbs suitable to the illness have been boiled.
Form of cupping vessel administered with fire.
Let its opening be the width of two open fingers, according to what we have shaped: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be a small hole in its side, about the middle of it, according to the size that a needle may enter it: let it be made of brass, or tin, of thick, smooth, even, and polished edges, so that it does not injure the limb in its position on it: and let a transverse rod of brass or iron be in its middle, where the candle with fire is placed.
And now this cupping vessel is made large, larger than the one we have described, and a little smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of him who uses it.
For the cupping vessels of children and thin people are different from the cupping vessels of men and those with large bodies.
The method of placing this cupping vessel with fire on the limb is as follows: light a wick with fire made of linen suitably, or a small candle made of wax, and place it on the middle of the transverse rod that is in the middle of the cupping vessel, so that the fire is burning approximately at the lower part of the cupping vessel, so that the sick person's body is not burned.
Then it is placed on the limb, and a finger is placed over the hole I mentioned, as long as we hold the cupping vessel: when we need to, we remove the finger, and vapor will emerge through that hole, and the cupping vessel will immediately be released.
Then light the wick in its own way, and repeat it, if you need it.
However, in the cupping vessel administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole; and it is not administered unless it is filled with water and placed on the limb only.
And this is its form.
And the larger this cupping vessel is, so that it can take much water, the better it is.
Concerning the suspension of leeches.
Leeches are not applied in many places, except in those limbs where cupping is not possible, due to their small size, such as the lip, and gums, and similar parts. Or on a limb stripped of flesh, such as a finger, and nose, and similar parts.
And the quality of using them is: that you obtain leeches which are in fresh, clean waters, free from corruption.
Then let them be kept in fresh water by day and night, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies. Then the body should be emptied primarily with bloodletting and cupping. Then wipe the sick limb until it turns red. Afterwards, place them upon it.
When, therefore, they are filled, and fall, and suction of the place with a cupping glass is possible, then it is more effective in helping: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. Then with much water, and it is rubbed, and squeezed out.
If the flow of blood after the falling of the Sanguisugæ continues, and it is oozing: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the oozing is stopped.
If the blood multiplies, then powder on it ground zegi, or galls, and similar astringents, until the blood stops.
Or place on the area the halves of shelled beans: and leave them, until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
And if a repetition of the Sanguisugæ is necessary, when possible, change them.
If, however, the leeches are prevented from being suspended, then the place should be wiped with fresh blood. Or pierce the place with a needle, until something emerges from the blood. Then place them, for when they feel something of the blood, they immediately adhere.
Therefore, when you want them to fall off, sprinkle something of crushed aloe, or salt, or ash on them: and they will fall off immediately.
This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Know, O children, that the foolish physicians and the common people boast about this chapter, and those who have never examined the books of the ancients, nor read a letter from them.
And for this reason, this method is private among the sciences in our land. And I have never encountered any good in it at all, and I have not attained that which I have attained in it unless because of the length of reading the books of the ancients, and the study upon understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Then I adhered to experimentation and study for the length of my life.
And now I have described to you from it in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge: and upon which my experimentation has passed, after I have abbreviated it for you, and delivered it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it by the end of abbreviation, and shown it by the end of declination: and I have formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, since it is by addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter II.
It is necessary, as we say in the prologue of this chapter, to sum up the discourse and the chapters, so that the artisan is first compelled to understand their truth: namely, so that you, and those who are ready, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall, occurs to someone: then it is necessary, first of all, to bleed him, and to loosen him, or both simultaneously: if nothing prohibits it, such as weakness of strength: or if he to whom something of those things has occurred is a child, or an aged decrepit person: or if the time is of vehement heat, or of vehement cold very much.
Then let him be content in his food with cool vegetables, and the flesh of birds, and kids: and forbid wine, and coarse meats, and repletion from foods and every food that fills the veins with blood. Until when you are secure from a hot abscess, and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the sick man return to his former regimen with which his habit ran.
When, therefore, the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods, with much, thick, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar things to them. For with this regimen, the coagulation of the fracture is made quicker and better.
And know that fractured bones, when they are in men who are in the first old age and decrepit, are not possible to be continued and consolidated according to their own nature always, because of the drying out of their limbs: and those that are from them, at the end of gentleness, are consolidated and continued, like the bones of young children.
However, nature attaches to the fractured bone from every side something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres to and binds it, until they are glued together and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing hinders it from its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you provide the sick person with nourishment of foods that possess weight, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: for the fracture of the thigh is different from the fracture of the skull; and the fracture of the breastbone is different from the fracture of the spine; and likewise all the other limbs are different from each other: and I have come with a reminder of every type of fracture, set out in its chapter, distinct from another. And the types of bone fractures are diversified even within themselves.
Because a fracture of it occurs in an arched shape, besides which splinters happen in it. And sometimes its fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and there are its fractures that are splinters, that is, splinters, and proceeding additions, as are in a reed when the knife is fitted for writing. And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head; and there is a fracture with a small fissure.
And every type has its own nature or instrument in its restoration, according to which its mending will come, distinct in its own places.
And from that by which the fracture of the bone is known, there is its twisting, and its own prominence, and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in place, nor sound upon touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the sufferer experience great pain: then there is no fracture there; rather, it is possible that there is twisting, or a small fissure; therefore, you should not move it with the hand and pressure entirely, but rather place upon it from the medicines, of which mending comes, after the time that is suitable for the place; then a thin bandage should be tied.
And know that when a place is curved and divided into two, besides what exertions happen in it, yet each part is removed from its counterpart; then it is necessary for you to begin from your time for its straightening, making it even before a hot abscess happens to it.
However, if a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for a few days, until the abscess subsides. Then make it even according to whatever manner is possible by gentleness and skill.
And know that the restoration and straightening of it is easier than of a bone, in which exertions occur.
Then bind it, according to what memory of it will come to you.
If, however, there are exertions in the bone, then the extension of this fractured limb is necessary, from two parts, if it is a hand or a foot: or with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb upon an even surface, according to its natural shape, until, when the fractured parts of the limb are extended, then endeavor to restore those additions to their proper places with all your skill and in whatever way you can; and be careful, according to your strength, that no pain or harm comes upon the weak through your operation; and endeavor, according to your strength, to apply one of the two bones with its companion according to the best forms.
And it is necessary at that time to try and touch it with your hand. If, therefore, you see anything different there, correct it and equalize it by the amount of your strength.
And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do. For very often they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb through their operation, as we have already seen in their operations many times.
Then, after the equalization, and proper operation, and constriction of that limb, and rest, and tranquility, advise the sick person concerning it. And make him beware lest he move it during his waking hours, and his sleep, at its turning, and its agitation, and at its evacuation, and all his movements with his utmost strength. And that he be careful that the position of the limb is not one that will follow with pain. Because, when he feels pain or injury in the position of the limb, then he must change it to another position in which he does not feel pain.
And be careful with him that his position is equal, straight, so that twisting does not occur in the limb when it is restored.
And the quality of the fracture of the limb is as I describe.
Know that fractured limbs are diversified in their smallness and their size and their shape.
Therefore, those of them that are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the foot, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, thin cloth. However, those of them that are large, such as the thigh and the leg, it is necessary that there be a wrapping that is wide, hard.
Because a wide ligament connects a large limb and binds it from every side with equal tightness, so that no blemish enters it.
Then, after your evacuation, begin to apply a suitable liniment to it, in soft linen over the place of the fracture itself. Then begin to wrap the ligament over the place of the fracture itself with three or four wraps, according to what the limb deserves; and gently tighten your hand with the bandage.
Then proceed with it towards the upper part from the place of the fracture, and tighten less than was your tightening, with which you tightened the fractured place. Then draw away the bandage a little from the fracture site, and gradually loosen the tightness until you obtain a large amount from a healthy place.
Then take another strip, and wrap it again over the fractured place with wraps. Then proceed with the bandage towards the lower part from the fracture. And let your procedure be in the tightening of the bandage, and its loosening, according to what we said in the initial upper bandage.
Then place between the bandages soft wool or a cloth, with which the twisting of the fracture is equalized, if there is twisting in it: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Then wrap another strip over it. Afterwards, place over these bandages properly made strips immediately, if there is no swelling in the area, nor a hot abscess.
However, if there is swelling or an abscess in it, then place upon it whatever subsides the abscess and removes the swelling, and leave it for several days. Then tie strips over it.
And let the strips be from the middle parts of broad reeds, shaved and cleverly shaped; or let them be from wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or gerard, that is, palm branches, or calings; and let the width of each strip, according to this shape and this same form, be equal.
However, it is necessary that the strip placed over the wound itself be somewhat thicker and wider than the other strips; and the length of the strip shall be according to what is permissible for the member, in terms of its size and smallness.
Then tie another strip over the strips, according to the first tightening. Then bind from above with threads neatly, according to what we said about tightening; and it is so that your tightening should be greater over the place of the fracture; and the further it is stretched from the fracture, the tighter it should be.
And it is necessary that the middle threads be of medium thickness and thinness, and that they be of soft flax.
Because if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operation of foolish men who place their threads from twisted flax cords, it is a great error; because the tightening falls with them outside the proper quality.
And thin threads again are not suitable, because you will not achieve through tightening with them what you want.
And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger between splint and splint.
If the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after tightening in healthy areas, then place under them soft linen or dyed wool until nothing is damaged by it.
When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and a rupture occurs in the skin, I will come with a reminder of it in the second chapter according to its singularity.
And know that not every broken limb needs to be tightened with splints from the first day. That is because when a limb is large, you should not place splints upon it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the event of a hot abscess.
And this is the method of plasters, by which the ancients restored those which are placed over a fracture and dislocation.
Method of an abbreviated common plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, because it is from that which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
And it is that you take from the mill's dust, and it is the flour's pith which hangs on the mill's walls by the grinding of the millstone: and make it as it is, except that you sift it with the white of an egg: and put its confection not thick, nor thin. Then use it.
Method of another plaster, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting. Take gum arabic, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugath, and juice of all, each 10 scruples; myrrh and aloes, both 5 scruples; and alethil 20 scruples.  Grind all, sift, and mix with alethil water; or with the white of an egg, if the patient's complexion is hot. Then use this plaster. For it is of good composition, quickly restores broken bones, and benefits many people.
Method of another plaster, which also benefits fracture and twisting. Take mugath, and mess, and white mallow, of all 10 scruples; myrrh and aloes, both 5 scruples; acacia 6 scruples; Armenian bole 20 scruples.  Grind all thoroughly, sift, and make into a paste with water, or the white of an egg; and administer.
Method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places; and it relieves the pain that comes upon them, and the cracking and fracture of the bone. Take wool, soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it over the affected area.
And in this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good in calming a hot abscess; and it expels pain properly.
Method of plaster, which restores a broken bone. Take leaves of the wild fig and leaves of the wild poppy; and grind them all together, and make a plaster from both.
Method of a shortened plaster, administered in the restoration of a fractured bone; and when you wish for the resolution of the remaining abscess. Take root of marshmallow, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, of each one part: let all be ground, and mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
If however it is inflamed, then mix it with water of moist coriander, or with water, and use it.
Method of another stronger plaster in resolution, than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of a limb. Take root of marshmallow, and linseed, and pomegranate bark, and melilot, and sorrel, and violet flowers, and chamomile, of each one part; let all be ground, and mixed with willow water, or with fresh water, or with wine. All of that according to the warmth of the limb, and the quiet of its heat.
Hippocrates however did not say in his book that something be placed upon a fractured limb in its restoration, except for a cerote made from wax and oil: nothing else; and he related that it should be intermediate between thickness and thinness.
Galen, however, deemed that things that contain the drying of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and frankincense, and similar to those that we have mentioned, should be placed on a fractured limb in its restoration.
Method of a plaster which is beneficial for injury and pain. Take equal parts of mugwort, chickpeas, cut human hair (or bird's feathers), marshmallow root, and salt: grind, sift, and mix them together; and make a plaster from it.
The amount of time, after which the bandage should be removed, is as follows: if the patient experiences no pain, no itching, and the fractured bone remains in place, then do not remove it for many days. If the patient experiences intense itching, or troublesome pain, or swelling at the site, then quickly remove the bandage immediately, and take the plaster off: take a soft cloth or soft sea sponge, moisten it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain is settled.
If the patient experiences intense itching, or troublesome pain, or swelling at the site, then quickly remove the bandage immediately, and take the plaster off: take a soft cloth or soft sea sponge, moisten it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain is settled. Then allow the limb to rest for one hour. Then place upon it a piece of finely cut wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bind it upon it for one night, until you are sure of the absence of a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Then apply a thin bandage and a small plaster, and do not tighten your initial bandage and the subsequent ones too tightly until it heals.
If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all the accompanying symptoms have completely disappeared, and you no longer need a plaster and bandage, then treat it again as you did at first equally.
If none of the things we have described happens to the limb, then do not loosen it until after three, or four, or five, or seven days. And when twenty days have passed, and the entire area, as you see from the loosening of the limb, as we said, is such that the fracture is adhered to, and the flesh has coagulated over it, then add more bandage than your first bandage altogether; and also add in the thickening of the weak substance, according to the remembrance of that which preceded.
However, if you see the fracture site already drying out and weakening more than necessary, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it. Therefore, embrocate it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let it be there for all three days, and slightly loosen the bandage.
Through this operation, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
However, what foolish restorers do with a fractured limb a second time, when it is not restored at first as it should be, and is restored according to twists and turns, is an error of their operation, and great fear; and if it were correct, the ancients would have said it in their books, and operated with it.
And I have seen no trace of it anywhere in that at all, and it is better that it not be done.
Concerning the accidental injury to the head.
The species of fractures are diverse, and its forms numerous; and its causes are distinct.
For there is a fracture that occurs from a blow with a sword; and the blow removes the bone entirely, as far as it reaches the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axe does in wood; and because of that, this species of fracture is called Axialis.
Or the sword cuts a portion of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its utmost extent; and this species of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a lifting up absolutely.
And it is a wound of two fractures, either great or small.
And there is a fracture that is a crushing or grinding; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture is also either penetrating, which now approaches the soft tissue that is beneath the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone; and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
And there is a fracture that is hidden within the bone, in the subtlety of a hair; and it is a small fissure, and because of that this species of fracture is called Capillaris.
And of them is a fracture that happens from a fall, or from a blow of a stone, and things like them, that cause a lamina of bone to enter its interior, and a cavity is formed; just as happens with copper kettles, when a blow hits them, and part of them enters the interior.
And this happens most often in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
And in all these types of fractures, separate efforts are made, and I will come with a reminder of the whole of it in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fracture by probing over them, and investigating them with probes, and removing the corrupted flesh that is over them.
The capillary type, however, is recognized by this, that it is detected over the bone, and scraped off, and smeared over it with ink: for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms that it signifies clearly a fear, such as vomiting, cholera, extension, loss of understanding, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, protrusion of the eyes, redness of them, and similar symptoms in many dispositions, undoubtedly it will not be cured: and if you see symptoms not alarming you, and hope for recovery: then begin his treatment.
If a wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and it is during the winter days, then it is necessary to strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
And if it is during the summer days, then it is necessary to hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue beneath the bone becomes corrupted, and those symptoms which we have described occur.
If the fracture of the bone has already reached the tissue touching the brain, and is accompanied by pieces and pulling: then it is necessary to cut the broken and crushed part, as I describe to you.
And it is to shave the head of the wounded man and uncover the bone by any means possible to you, according to the shape of the wound, and what is easy for the patient.
If during the uncovering of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is necessary. And it is to fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose-water, and to keep the wound still until the abscess subsides and you are secure from the flow of blood. Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
And that is done according to one of two methods.
One method is to cut the bone with a scalpel of a narrow edge, and this is its form.
Then administer another scalpel after the first scalpel, somewhat wider; and this is its form.
Then administer yet another scalpel, wider still than the second one.
And the second method is that you should have a number of different scalpels; some of which are wider than others, and some shorter than others; and let the ends of their blades be sharp, and let them be of tempered steel, or iron; and use ease in striking on the scalpel, so that it does not strike the head, and injure it.
However, if the bone is strong, hard: then it is necessary that you pierce around it, before you administer the scalpels, with drills that are called drills, not penetrating deeply; and they are not called so, except because they do not pass through the boundary of the fleshy bone to that which is behind it; because the drill has a rounded end on that which is beneath its sharp, pointed head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents it from sinking in, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is fitting for you to take from these drills a multitude, each fitting the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill for every skull; whose sharp end in length and shortness should be according to the thickness of that skull.
And this is the form of three types of drills, or trepans.
The method of piercing around the fractured bone is: that you place the drill upon the bone, and revolve it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has now been pierced. Then change the drill to another place, and put what is between every hole the thickness of a radius, or approximately that.
Then cut with the chisels what is between each hole out of the bone, and make it finer than you can above it from the end of lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with any other of the instruments you have prepared for it: such as pliers, and fine forceps.
And you must take every precaution that the drill, or the chisel touches nothing of the flesh.
Therefore, when you have encircled the bone by piercing, and it has been separated from the flesh, if it has been continuous with it, and you have extracted it, you must smooth and equalize the end of it that remains in the bone with another similar instrument, a chisel. However, it must be thinner and more delicate than other chisels.
If any small, stubborn pieces of bone remain, then remove them easily with the instruments you have. Then treat the wound after that with the dressings and ointments that we have mentioned.
And another method of operation is easy, entirely free from fear: which Galen said, and praised greatly; and this is his statement. First, you must begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is more severe and obvious; until, when you have exposed that part, and have placed the end of this lenticular chisel beneath it, whose shape is this.
And the lenticular part, smooth, does not cut anything; and its sharp part running lengthwise on its two sides, as you see; so that the lenticular part rests on the bone, its sharp face meeting the bone.
Then strike the chisel from one side with a small mallet until you cut through the entire bone with ease, just as it revolves; and you be sure, from the bandage, that no accident happens to it, which you fear completely.
And if the physician were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of it, nor were he sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the bandage in some places, he would cut it away from it with the end of his lenticular chisel, and free it from it with ease. It is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the bandage, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughnesses and fine irregularities remain on it: then it is necessary to smooth away that roughness and scrape away those irregularities with fine scrapers of various sizes which you have prepared, so that it may be possible for you to apply those that are most suitable and most correct in each place, according to that to which the operation leads you, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape. And it is necessary that you apply, in your judgment, the wider scrapers first for scraping the bone. Then use a finer one after it.
And it is necessary that you apply, in your judgment, the wider scrapers first for scraping the bone. Then use a finer one after it. And do not cease to do this in a continuous manner until you reach the point of applying the thinnest and finest of them all.
In each of the remaining small fissures, and fine fractures, it is necessary to apply care, according to that which leads to its straightening.
And it is a matter not hidden from anyone who has any concern in this art, and who has stood upon what we have written and shown in the case of large fractures.
If, however, a flap is found and retained when you remove the bone, then it is necessary to take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening. Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do it as easily as you can over it, so that it is not burdened by this.
Then apply a broad bandage over it; and do not tighten it, unless by a quantity that only holds the wound together; and leave it with this treatment for one day, or two days, until you are sure of being free from a hot abscess. Then loosen it, and apply after that medicines with which superfluous dryness is overcome: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar to them; and it is that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the wound as they are dry.
And universally apply to it every medicine of whose property it is to cleanse, and not to bite. And beware according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clean; neither be there dirt of ointment, nor filth.
And beware according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clean; neither be there dirt of ointment, nor filth. Nor allow any pus to collect there at all; for when pus collects on the brain membrane, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and great harm comes upon the sick person after that; and this happens in the scalp, when the bone is exposed, especially when its treatment is neglected, a blackness on its surface.
Therefore consider, if the sick person experiences the accidents that we have mentioned, know that it is undoubtedly dangerous.
And if blackness does not occur, unless from the medicine placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to produce that blackness: then it is necessary to take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and to line a cloth with them. Then place it upon the scalp; afterwards treat it with the kinds of treatment that are appropriate, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Know that only the two upper parts of the nose are broken simultaneously, or one of them; because it has two bones.  Since the lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and only abrasion, twisting, and distortion befall it.
If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary to insert the little finger into the nostril, and to straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this skillfully and easily. And beware lest your operation cause pain to the sick person.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it is necessary to straighten it with the end of a radius bone, where there is a small thickness.
If the fracture is in two parts, then do likewise; and hasten its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible. And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at rest from a hot abscess.
Then insert into the end of the nose a bandage of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two bandages if the fracture is in two parts; and let the bandage have a thickness such that it fills the nasal opening.
And some of the ancient restorers said that the bandages should be soaked in butter, and changed every day. However, that does not seem to me appropriate; rather, the bandage should be soaked in egg white, mixed with mill dust. Then leave the bandage until the bone is strengthened and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose in place of a bandage, after a soft cloth is wrapped around it; and it is done so that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly and that the weak person is not prevented from breathing in.
And this is not necessary. If you wish, do it; and if you wish, do the bandages.
If it happens again while treating a hot abscess, plaster the nose with cerote, or with cot infused in rose oil, or a little diaquilon.
If however a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that you plaster it with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white. Then place soft linen upon it, and do not bind the nose at all.
If, however, the bones of the nose are broken, or fractured slightly, then it is necessary that you divide them, and extract them with instruments suitable for them. Then sew the wound, and treat it with whatever causes flesh to grow and consolidates it with suitable plasters or ointments.
If a wound occurs between the nostrils, then it is necessary that you treat it with bandages and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is fractured, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then look if the fracture is only on the outside and does not break into two pieces, but bends inward: then its recognition is easy.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and push the bend of the fracture from inside towards the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone properly, and thereby straighten it.
If the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to apply traction from both sides, according to the straightness, until its alignment is possible.
If, however, movement or breakage has already occurred in the teeth, then tie those which you hope will remain with gold, silver, or silk thread. Then place a poultice over the fractured jaw. Then place a doubled cloth over it, and put a large, properly made pledget on the cloth; or a piece of leather sole of equal length to the jaw.
Then bind it from above, according to the preparation for its ligature and its application is suitable, until it is not broken; and instruct the sick person to use quiet and rest; and give him food that is easily swallowed.
If, however, you estimate that something of the shape has already been altered in some way, then hurry and loosen it on the third day. Then rectify what has been altered from it, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the poultice; and place soft wool over the plaster.
While therefore that plaster remains attached to it, and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not loosen it, until it is healed; or tighten the fracture. For this fracture is often tightened in three weeks.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then administer that which we have said many times for its subsidence, until that abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, consider. For if a piece is already separated from the bone, or from the splinters, then be meticulous in this, so that you remove those splinters with whatever suits you in removing them from the instruments.
If truly the wound opening is constricted, then enlarge it with a phlebotomum according to your necessary quantity.
Then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains from them, close then the wound opening, if it is large; and if not, place over it from plasters which are appropriate for it, and cause it to heal, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the Furcula, when it is broken.
Indeed, the Furcula is most often broken from the anterior part, at the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
For it is either broken and separated into two, besides which splinters may occur in it; and it is easier to restore it.
Or, so that splinters occur in the bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Or so that it is a fracture with a wound.
And the operation in it, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you should have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the support that follows the fractured Furcula, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Then equalize the fracture with your fingers, until its form is as it should be: and there should be neither a prominence nor a concavity in it.
If you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a sphere of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your need: and extend and lift the Furcula, and narrow the sphere with your hand, until you equalize the fracture as it should be.
If you cannot pull the extremity of the Furcula outwards, because it has reached a depth, then it is necessary that the patient be laid on their back and you place a pillow of medium size under their shoulder, and let the assistant press on their shoulder downwards until the bone of the Furcula that is in the depth is lifted upwards; and then straighten the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
If, however, you feel a splinter from the Furcula and it moves, then you should cut over it and extract the splinter with ease.
If it is however retained in the bone, then make an incision on it with one of the scalpels you have prepared for it, after you place an instrument that preserves the sifach beneath the Furcula: and it is an instrument of wood or iron. And this is its form.
It resembles a spoon that has no cavity.
And let its width be according to that of which you have need, based on the size and smallness of the bone. Its length, however, also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end be wide, and the other narrow.
If however the rupture of the wound that you made when you extracted the bone splinter is wide, and you are secure from a hot abscess: then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches.
And if the rupture is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and lint according to the size of the wound's tear.
If a hot abscess should occur, then immerse a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it upon it.
A constriction of the bone, however, when it is without a wound, and without an incision, is to place upon the bone a plaster made from mill flour and egg white. And place soft lint upon it. Then place a sphere under its projection, if you need that. Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long and whose width is about one palm. Then place a doubled pad over the lint and plaster. Then take a thin piece of wood, whose width is three fingers and likewise in length. Then wrap it in cloth. Then wrap that cloth with the stick in the place of the alhimemati which falls upon the fracture and the location. Then place alhimemati over the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it over its neck, and under its healthy and under its infirm titillico: and reduce it over every part, and as you see that constriction holds the fracture in proper constriction: and that is, that it is not hidden from you, and all, so that the stick does not remove itself from over the fractured bone. And therefore it is necessary that you watch over the infirm person every day. Therefore, whenever the ligament softens, and you see the stick already removing itself, then straighten it and tighten the ligament.
Then place the patient's sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his arm at his sleep at night, so that with it his assistance might be lifted from his side. Therefore the fracture of the forearm is lifted by the lifting of the humerus.
Or bind his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the ligament if it does not happen in a place that happens from itching, or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Then renew the plaster, if you see its face to it. And add in constriction, and leave him until he is restored and coagulated.
And indeed a fracture of the forearm is tightened and strengthened most of all in twenty-eight days, and sometimes it happens in some people in a shorter time.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured shoulder blade.
The shoulder blade is rarely fractured, and at its broad part; and only its edges are fractured from it.
Therefore, when a part of it is fractured, and it is broken in its middle, and that is not recognized except by touch, then according to the nature of the fracture, attempt its preparation. And reduce it to its natural shape by every means of skill that is possible for you.
Then place flour of mill with the white of an egg, and soft linen, and put a little cushion of folded cloth on top. Then place upon it a broad splint of thin wood, according to the size of the whole shoulder blade, or a little larger.
If however there is a hollow under the splint in any part of the shoulder blade, then equalize that hollow with soft linen until the splint comes down to a level.
Then bind over it with a long bandage, with suitable constriction, and firmness of the splint, until it does not move from its place.
And consider the bandage every day. Whenever therefore the bandage softens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it moves from its place; and let the sick person lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade indeed is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the bandage; and you will be in safety. For it is from bones whose union is not feared, nor their separation.
If however a piece of bone protrudes, and pierces beneath the skin: then cut over it, and remove it. And do what we said in the fracture of the collarbone from the resolution of a hot abscess, if anything happens from it.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured breastbone.
The breastbone sometimes breaks in its middle, and that rarely happens. Its extremities, indeed, are broken and crushed most often from its accidents.
When its middle breaks, which inclines downward, and a violent pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing occur to him; and perhaps he vomits blood, and a concavity is revealed in the fractured bone, and not hidden from the senses, its restoration is that the sick person be laid supine on his back, and a pillow be placed between his scapulae.
Then press his shoulders, and gather the ribs from both sides with your hands, and make them equal in their alignment, according to every manner in which it is possible and appropriate, until the shape of the bone returns as it should.
Then place a plaster and linen bandage over it, and place a thin, light board made of willow or similar material, after you wrap it in cloth, on top of that. Then adjust the binding over the fractured bone so that it does not move, and go around the back with the bandage several times, and bind it with a suitable tightening.
Then check the bandage every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it; and if its necessity calls for its removal due to itching or the corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or an abscess, then quickly remove it and take off the plaster, and correct whatever has happened with the manner of its treatment.
Then replace the plaster, if you see a need for it: and apply a bandage to it until it heals.
Concerning the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick areas following the back, and from their extremities at the front. And attrition does not occur to them unless because they are cartilaginous. And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense in examination with the fingers.
And its restoration is done so that one aligns the fracture with the fingers as much as possible, until the shape is equal, as is fitting. Then apply plasters, and bind the fractured bone with splints, if it needs them.
And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inward, then a great pain and a stabbing occur to the sick person, like the stabbing that occurs to one who has pleurisy: because the bone stabs the lining, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood also occur to him; and this is a difficult cure.
And the ancients were ingenious in it with many devices: and among them are those who say that you should give the sick person foods that generate inflammation and windiness, so that the belly will become inflamed and distended, and that the fracture will be driven outward.
But we abhor this, lest a rapid cause for a hot abscess be made, if it does not occur. If however it has already occurred, then add to it.
And some of them said: Let a windy substance be placed over the spot, then it should be sucked with force, and this is a similar reasoning. However, it is feared that the windy substance will attract superfluous fluids to the spot, due to the weakness of the condition.
And some of them said: It is necessary that the spot be covered with wool that has already been immersed in hot oil; and cushions should be placed between the ribs, until it is filled; so that there is an even binding when you wrap it around the rounded shape.
Then the sick person should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, using food and medicine.
If a violent matter, which the patient cannot tolerate, constricts the patient, and the mouth pricks or the covering hurts with a piercing wound, and we fear for the patient, then it is necessary to cut over the spot and expose the broken rib. Then we shall place upon it the instrument that preserves the sifac, the description of which preceded; and we shall cut the bone with ease, and cut it.
Then we shall bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures; and we shall treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
If meanwhile a hot abscess occurs, then hasten, and infuse lint into rose oil, and place it over the spot; and let the patient be treated with that which suits the abscess.
Meanwhile, let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured spine of the back and neck.
A fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the neck, and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back. Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider. For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in most cases is mortal.
But if he moves them, and feels the contraction with the fingers and the prick, then know that the neck bone is sound, and that the sick person will be cured with treatment.
If the same happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider his feet.  If you see that they are softened, and that the same happens to them as to the hands; then when he lies on his back, wind and excrement are expelled involuntarily; and when he lies on his stomach, excrement is expelled involuntarily; and when he lies on his back and wishes to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is mortal. Therefore, do not labor in his treatment.
If, however, nothing of that happens to him, the condition is less serious.
And the treatment for what happens from that is, to attempt to soothe a hot abscess: thus, to place on the vertebra crushed rose oil alone, or with the yolks of roasted eggs.
Place that on it several times a day, until when the hot abscess is soothed; then place a strengthening, drying plaster on the area and bind it with a bandage; and prescribe to the sick person rest and tranquility. Nor should he sleep on the part where he finds pain until he is healed.
If it happens at a point where the bone is fractured, or something already separated from it: then it is necessary to dissect above the skin and remove it. Then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures. Then treat it with some kind of healing ointment until it is healed.
If, however, the last bone of the tail is fractured, and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and to align the fractured bone with the other hand, as far as possible, with a second adjustment.
Then place it over it, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment that preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the Hip.
Chapter XI.
The bones of the hips are rarely broken. If they are broken, then their fracture is not unless they are shattered at the extremities: and they are split lengthwise, and are deflected inward: and the patient experiences pain and a puncture in the area, and the leg that is fractured becomes numb.
And its restoration is to extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture as its shape is.
If the fracture is only at its extremities, then equalize that fracture according to what is prepared for you by equalizing, until its shape is made similar to its natural shape.
If however the fracture is lengthwise, or already inclines inward, then make the patient lie on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. When therefore you have equalized it, place a plaster over it; then place a splint of wood, or of leather, over it; and bind it tightly with a bandage so that you fear neither a change in the fracture nor the removal of the splint.
And equalize the concavity of those things with what fills it, until the bandage takes it according to equality; and command the patient to sleep on their back, or on their healthy side.
If however a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from its extension and its restoration until the hot abscess subsides; and place upon it that which settles it, according to what has gone before, then return to its restoration; and bind it as is proper.
If however it occurs in the bone and is shattered or crushed, remove it.
On the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
The arm is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder blade.
If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is: that you should take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
And two bandages are tied at the two extremities.
Then it should be suspended from a raised place, and the sick person should sit on a seat. Then let him place his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the tickle of it, in the middle of which the curvature of the wood is attached.
Then suspend something heavy above it, so that the minister extends it downwards. Then the physician should align the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns to the way it should be.
And another method is that the sick person should lie on their back on their neck; and suspend his hand from his neck with a bandage. Then command two ministers, that one of them should hold that which is above the fracture with his hands, and that the other should hold below it, and that each of them should extend to their side.
And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage, and let each of the two ministers extend them to their own sides.
If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed below the armpit, and another below the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a bandage be placed over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Then equalize the fracture with ease without labor, until when the fracture is equalized as it ought to be, and a good application is applied: then bind it, if a hot abscess does not happen.
If however a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day. And place over it cut wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess subsides: then bind it: and the manner of binding it is that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster. Then let the arm be supported by that support, and let him place his open hand on his shoulder.
And place a cloth, and bind the arm over the support, so that the arm stands in the position of stars: if nothing hinders you from that, nor is anything of the broken bone disturbed on you.
If you fear that anything of the broken bone may be disturbed on you, then use splints: and it is to place a splint over the fracture itself that is wider and stronger than the other splints. And place the width of a finger between each splint; and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on every side.
Then bind over the splints the binding that I have spoken of at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is to be that your binding be tighter over the place of the fracture. And the more the fracture is lengthened, the less the binding should be.
If therefore you see the position of the splints and the binding, as we have said, in the hour in which you restore the limb immediately, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave the binding and the splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then consider the ligament for all three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur in the place, or that food is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the disposition of excess fluid from the binding. Therefore, rectify it all, according to what we have said.
If however you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not loosen the binding, unless after three days, or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on his back, and his hands on his stomach; and place under him a mattress filled with wool evenly.
And consider at every hour of night or day, that the fractured limb's shape is not dislodged, or that the binding is loosened. Therefore, rectify it all with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order we have prescribed, so that initially the food be subtle, until the mouth begins to tighten; then it is necessary to increase his food.
For it is the custom of the wound and leg that it tighten in forty days; then, therefore, it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath be administered, and that it be treated with ointments which rectify it.
If the fracture is foul, bruised, then do not loosen the bandages and splints from it until fifty days, and up to two months.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearms.
One of which is small and it is that which follows the thumb. And the other is large, and it is that which is situated beneath the small one at its lower part.
Perhaps therefore only the larger forearm is broken, or the smaller one; and perhaps they are broken simultaneously.
When therefore the smaller forearm is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the forearm is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken simultaneously.
If therefore the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm above, then it is fitting for the physician, at its restoration, to apply a small extension with ease, until it is made even.
If however the large forearm is that which is broken: then it is necessary that he apply a much stronger constriction.
And it is necessary that he place a figure of the hand at its restoration, and its extended extension upon a cushion. And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers: and let the lower joint be below all the fingers, or the rest: and the patient sitting square upon himself, and let the cushion be before him, or in line with him, in height, so that the patient does not incur hardship.
Then let the attendant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand, or with a bandage. And another attendant should extend it from above in the same way.
Then the physician should adjust the bone until he restores it to the best possible form.
If in the fracture of the bone there are fragments, then endeavor to return every fragment to its place by your skill.
If however a separated fragment appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration for you: then dissect over it, and remove it according to the manner which we have said in those which are previously mentioned.
If however the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a special chapter on it, therefore take the treatment from there.
If however a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then line a cloth with a cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be intermediate between thickness and thinness; and bind the cloth over it with a subtle constriction, until when the abscess is calmed: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill powder with egg white. Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in many arrangements, whether the fracture is in one bone, or in two bones together.
Then apply your bandage to the site of the fracture more strongly and forcefully, and somewhat more with the bandage towards the upper or lower part of the fracture; or apply a gentler bandage, a bit less constricting than the one previously mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.
And let the cloths wrapped around the fracture be soft, moist; and let them not be hard, rough. And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen, properly, of a medium thickness between fine and coarse, as we have described.
And consider the limb and the ligament after days. If anything requiring rectification occurs, such as itching in the limb, then it is necessary to bathe the limb in warm water until the itching subsides, and to leave the limb unbandaged until it subsides, then reapply the bandage.
If the bandage is now softened, and the bone is now removed, and similar things to these: then rectify it all with your skill, and consider again.
For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, due to the excessive tightness of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and to leave it for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, then bandage it again.
If, however, nothing of what we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days, or approximately this many.
Then the sick person's hand should be suspended from his neck. And his neck should be level, and be protected by his own skill from violent movements. And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days. All that is according to the dispositions of the complexions, and the dispositions of the strength.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the Hand.
Know that fracture of the hand's knuckles and the nodes of the fingers rarely occurs. And it does not occur to it unless by very frequent friction.
Therefore, when a fracture or abrasion of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the sick person sit square; and before him be a seat according to equality. Then place his hand upon it extended.
Then let the attendant extend the broken bones, and let the physician adjust them, until when they are joined by a good union.
Then it is necessary that he apply a plaster and linen bandage, if a hot abscess does not occur. Then place a pad over it according to the amount of the area; and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
If however the fracture is towards the lower part of the sole of the foot, then make something like a sphere out of cloth; and command the sick person to compress it with their fractured foot; then bind it with a long cloth.
And let the pad be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather is applied to the sole of the foot; and bind it, according to what is necessary.
If however the fracture is to the outside, then it is necessary: that you place a pad on top, and another pad from below on the sole; and let the hand be straight and open. Then place a bandage, as the hand is rotated; and stretch it between the fingers with a ligature.
If, however, a fracture occurs in any of the finger joints, then if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as necessary. Then bind it to the sole; and if you wish, place a small straight pad on it so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
If, however, the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it should be straightened, and bound to the healthy finger that follows it; or all should be bound in sequence; and this is better. Or place a small pad on it, as we said for the thumb.
And consider in your treatment, and after the resolution of the hot abscess: and apply what is necessary, when anything from it happens, according to the repetition of its description.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured hip.
The hip bone is often fractured, and it is revealed to the senses, because it is turned inward and backward.
And its restoration is done thus, that a ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture. And the sick person lies prostrate on their face.
Then let the attendant stretch every ligament on his side equally; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
However, if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let one ligament be on the side of the crest, so that the extension falls upward; and another ligament below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Then the physician shall equalize the bone with both of his hands, until he restores it to the likeness of its natural shape; and the bone is joined with good union.
Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and a bandage, if a festering sore does not occur to the limb. If a festering sore occurs there, then leave it for several days until the hot festering sore subsides, then return to your treatment.
However, its bandage should be like this. It is necessary that you wrap a hard bandage over the fracture, that is, a bandage, and double it twice or thrice, and let there remain surplus of it. Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts. Then revolve over the leg and thigh what is in excess of the bandage.
Then place on the thigh, at the site of the fracture itself, splints, and place one splint upon the bone of the leg.
Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the tightness is equalized.
Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle over the fracture site in three or four turns. And the further you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, the less tight and softer and gentler your bandage should be.
Then pull on the two ends of the thread, which you have inserted between the thigh and leg. Tie together the three splints that are on top. Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the ankle of the foot. And with both ends tighten also the ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage does not shift from its place.
Then loosen the tightening on it, while it remains, so that no ulceration, or abscess, or swelling, and similar things, befall the limb. If any of those things happen. Therefore, hasten with its solution, and rectify whatever has happened from that, entirely, according to what we have said many times.
If however there is a piece of bone from the bone that pricks: then it is necessary, that you make it even, if it is possible for you. And if not, split over it, and remove it: and treat it with what preceded its mention, until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, besides which splints are added to it, as we said in the assistance and the arm.
However, in the restoration of it, thus fractured, lameness does not happen to the sick person. And if it is restored alone, besides which the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one to whom it belongs should always limp.
And know that the hip is bound in fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is lessened: all that is according to the diversity of complexions and the other dispositions.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured kneecap.
Know that a fractured kneecap rarely happens, but it often suffers from attrition.
If however a fracture does happen to it, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts. And it is with a wound, and without a wound. And it is supported by all of it with sensation.
And its restoration is such that what is broken from its parts is equalized with fingers, until it is brought together and joined as much as possible by equalization and ease and fabrication.
Then apply a plaster of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white: and place a round pad on top of it, if you need it: and bind it above with suitable bandages to it.
Then consider all the dispositions that we have narrated in the other fractures: such as a hot abscess, and similar to it: so that you oppose every accident with what is appropriate to it, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick and is called the Cruris bone, and the other thin, and is called the Focile bone.
And both kinds of fractures occur in the same way as in the two bones of the arm; and on account of that, its restoration is done, just as the restoration of the arm, equally, and the operation is the same.
If both bones are broken at the same time, the leg is turned in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is turned towards the front.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it lower; and it is from among those that are not hidden from you.
Then administer extension, and equalisation, and the binding of splints according to that equally.
However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having much pus, your extension should be less and your easing gentler.
And in the leg there is something more in the operation than in the arm; and it is that, when you equalize the splints and complete all your operation, then take two strips of pinewood, which are used in the making of beams which are placed under planks, and are made from the palm's leaflets; and choose those with a small thickness, and let them not be thin; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Then wrap each one in two folds along its length. And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side; and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Then tie the two strips in three places from the two ends and the middle. For when constriction is forbidden, the leg bends to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
And now indeed let a cradle of wood be administered along the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it may preserve it from movement.
And it is very necessary, that you do this in a fracture when there is a wound properly with it.
Then consider the leg each day, and strive with that final care from the abscess, or inflammation, or other remaining ailments. If therefore anything of those happens, then apply to it with that which is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
Of the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
A fracture of the heel bone indeed does not happen completely.
However, a fracture sometimes happens to the bones of the foot, and a fracture also rarely happens to the toes; and it happens to them only by attrition in many dispositions.
If a fracture of the bones of the foot happens, and you see those bones rising up against each other, then the infirm person should place their foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Then stand, and place your foot on that which is raised from those bones; afterward press, or tread upon it, and straighten it until it returns to its place.
Then place a plaster, and linen on top; and put a small board beneath the sole of the foot, having two flat ends.
Then bind it with a suitable bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths, and other things it needs.
When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage. For you will find the bones straightened, whether they were broken or dislocated. Therefore, the operation is on them, as you see.
If however some fingers are broken, then restore them and straighten them according to what I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place a splint along the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider than it; then place under the foot this board which I have told you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
If however what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place on each finger a splint of its own size, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board at the sole of the foot; and let it stand upon one end of the board outside the sole of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
And it befits you, that you not forget, to consider all that I have said to you in the remaining fractures from accidents that we have spoken of; and apply to every accident that which is appropriate.
Concerning the fracture of the vulva of a woman, and the breastbone, and the penis of a man.
When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit square. Then incline her a little towards her back, and let her be held back.
Then let the midwife fill her vulva with wool, until it fills it; and let it become like a sphere in the vulva from it.
Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually. For that wool will come out, until it becomes like a sphere before the gate of the vulva, and the broken opening returns.
Then place a cushion upon her back. Therefore, when she wishes to urinate, remove the wool with ease, then let her urinate; and return it according to the manner in which you first introduced it; then let her return to her initial cushion.
Let her do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the opening itself is restored.
And if you wish, take the bladder of a sheep, and tie a reed cannula over its opening, and introduce the entire bladder into her vulva. Then blow into the cannula with force, until the bladder inflates within the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Then let it be filled with wool, and let it stand for some days, according to what we have described, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the pubic region of a man or woman breaks, then administer in its restoration, and its equalization, that which we have described in the case of the sacral bone.
And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially to one who has some skill or experience.
And understand my book well, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many situations the right way in its restoration, and its tightening: understand therefore.
In the penis of a man, when it breaks, take a goose's throat and insert it into it. Then place upon it a bandage of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and let it be left for three days, or about that time, and it will heal, if God wills.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured bone, when it is with a wound.
It is fitting for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or the femur, or similar to it, that you hasten and immediately phlebotomize him: if the conditions for phlebotomy are evident to you, as we have already stated.
If the wound is flowing blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to cauterize it, so that you powder it with crushed zegi: if another is not present for you.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, if an abscess does not arise.
If, however, a hot abscess arises, then postpone its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides. And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause him to suffer ill accidents.
If however the broken bone is prominent above the skin, then it is necessary that you try to reduce it, and to align it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
If, however, its extension and alignment with your hands are not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument. And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the quantity of the wound. And for that, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, according to the quantity needed for the treatment of every type of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it have a small thickness so that it does not double upon compression upon it during the operation, and let it have sharp ends, with a margin at its extremities. And let its upper part be of a thickness from the middle to the lower part.
And this is its form.
In this operation, its pointed curved end must be placed upon the prominent bone end, and drive it with it in a single motion, until the bone returns and becomes aligned.
Therefore, strive to align the fractured ends together.
If its fractured ends are delicate and the instrument cannot properly grasp them, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it.
However, if you cannot reduce them at all with what we have described, then cut it with one of the cutting instruments we mentioned, or saw it with a saw in any way possible for you.
Then scrape away whatever remains on the bone of roughness and small pieces.
Therefore, when the bone is reduced, and the weak person after its reduction finds severe, painful injury, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
So do that. For you confer great help to the sick person, when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Then immerse the cloth in astringent, black wine. And properly if it is in summer. And do not place on the wound a cauterized thing, nor anything in which there is oil, so that it may not cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Then administer the splints at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone. And leave the wound uncovered, so that you make an incision with scissors in the wrappings according to the size of the wound.
And beware with every precaution not to bind the wound with the fracture. For many times foolish physicians have done this: and they have caused to befall upon their sick either death, or corruption, or zuchem, that is, pus. And let your ligature be soft, gentle, different from the ligatures of the other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or if the wound is large, and you fear some of the bad accidents which we have mentioned, and you find pain in the suspended place: then you should not place splints upon it. And make for them wrappings from hard cloths in the place of splints, and bind it with them.
When, however, it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus in it: then remove from above it the cloth which you have placed upon it with wine. Then administer bandages and ointments with which it is customary for us to treat wounds: such as the tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar ones.
And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage. And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus runs from it downwards with ease.
If many days pass over a wound, and it is not consolidated, nor is pus separated from it: then know that there are small bone splinters there. Therefore it is necessary that you investigate the wound with probes. As many of those splinters as are separated, remove them and extract them. And those of them that are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain to occur, attempt to cut them, and remove them in every way possible to you.
If a wound suffers from a züch, or ekileten, that is, festering, or another sort of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary that you apply to each of them with what is suitable for it from the treatment, of which the account preceded in its chapter.
And in that which my discourse must take hold, and to which you should apply your attention when a bone is broken and protrudes from a limb, such as the bone of the hip, and the kneecap, and similar ones from the large limbs, it is that you should not presume to pull it back, for often death arises from that, but rather leave it alone until it putrefies.
For perhaps it will fall away by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Then therefore treat the wound, if it seems good to you; and if not, leave it alone.
Concerning the treatment of a swelling at the site of a fracture.
This swelling often happens at the site of a fracture's healing. Especially those near the joints; and the shape of the limb is disfigured by it. And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Therefore, if the swelling is recent, administer medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar ones.
So, take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and place them on the swelling in linen, and bind them tightly over it.
And leave the binding on, and do not loosen it for many days. Then loosen it and apply another, until the swelling is removed.
Or bind a lead sheet firmly over it. For lead has the property of removing all that is feared from the limbs.
However, if the swelling has already become hard, and is tight, and necessity quickly compels one to remove it: then split it from above, and cut off the protruding excess: or shave it with some razors until it is removed: and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and the limb remains after it, in a state not natural to it.
When a broken bone is restored, and the limb remains afterward thin, weak: then it is not so except for many reasons. Some of which are: a multitude of loosening and binding the ligament not as it should; or due to excessive tightening of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb; or due to excessive application of fomentation at an inappropriate time; or due to a lack of blood in the body of the weak person, and their weakness.
And the treatment for this is to nourish the weak person, and to make his body tender, until blood multiplies in him. And administer a bath. And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Then apply pitch to the limb; so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it. And diligently apply a poultice of it with lukewarm water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
When, after the healing of a limb that has already been restored, crookedness, and a prominence of the fractured bone, or a knotting, occurs, and the form of the limb is disfigured thereby, yet the limb is not hindered from its natural function, then you should not heed the opinion of one who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
And already there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who did that in our land.
And indeed this operation is very reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, so that it is mortal.
But if the lameness and knotting are recent, then it is necessary to bathe it in lukewarm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as mallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and similar things. And a plaster should be made with a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Or take the mucilage of mallow root, and mix it with chicken fat, or sesame oil: and plaster it with that.
Or take fat figs, and rub them with pigeon dung, and similar things to them called from among the medicines that lessen consolidation.
And sometimes the knotting is loosened with diligent, old, and gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands. And movement of the limb should be administered to every part at all hours.
However, if twisting has already occurred, and become strong, and turned into stone, and the need has arisen to treat it with iron: then it is necessary that the upper part of it be cut, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and that what is superfluous from the knotting or the bone be cut with thin knives; and ease be given to it with care and diligence.
Concerning the discourse on Dislocation.
Dislocation is the departure of any joint from its place. Therefore it is prevented from its movement, and the figure of the limb is disfigured. And it causes grievous pains and severe injuries to the afflicted.
Therefore, when any dislocation occurs, one must hasten to its restoration; nor should one delay it at all.
For if it is delayed, the place will become inflamed, and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation will be lost with it.
Therefore, it should not be moved or extended during its inflammation. Because it often causes spasms and damaging pains.
But when that happens, then it is necessary to hasten to bleed the patient. Then let it be left until the inflammation subsides.
Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil. Then it should be reduced gently.
And every limb should be treated with whatever will cause its return to its proper place.
I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even as it preceded in fractures, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws are rarely dislocated unless infrequently.
And dislocation of both occurs according to one of two ways. For either they are moved from their places by a small removal, and are softened a little. Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation, until they are softened to the chest area, until the sick person's saliva runs, and he is unable to hold it, nor able to close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with speech.
When, however, its dislocation is small, then it returns in several positions by itself with few efforts.
If however it is a complete, entire dislocation, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and it is so that the attendant holds the sick person's head; and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw between his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side. Or he inserts two of his thumbs simultaneously, if the dislocation is from two sides. And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he equalizes.
And command the sick person to cleanse his jaws, and to make them free to eat on every side. And the physician should adjust the jaw, and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are simultaneously affected: then apply vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
When therefore they return and are equalized, and the sick person's mouth is closed, and they are not softened: then place on them pads of cloth, with a cerate made from wax and rose oil.
Then it is to be bound with ease with soft bandages.
And let the sick person's sleep be on their back, and let their head be supported between two pillows, so that it does not move to the right or left, nor attempt, or be forced to chew anything: indeed, let their food be administered by sipping, gently, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is bound: then let them eat what they wish, and let it be administered easily.
Let them not exert themselves over the operation of their mouth in eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is bound, and healed.
If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places: then fevers and continual sweating often result from this, and perhaps the patient's bowels are loosened, and perhaps pure bile is vomited.
Therefore, when you see this, then know that it is destruction, and often the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the humerus.
The collarbone indeed does not become dislocated from the inner side, because of its continuation with the chest. And it sometimes dislocates outwards, and this is evident to the senses.
And its restoration is that the sick person lies on their back, and extends their arms. Then grasp the place firmly with your hand, for it will return.
Then place a plaster and cushions over it, and bind it tightly.
However, its extremities that follow the elbow and continue with it do not dislocate, except rarely. If it dislocates on any day, then it must be reduced and straightened as we have said, and as is prepared for you.
Then place a plaster and cushions over it, and a bandage. And command the sick person to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And with this same treatment, the humerus extremity is reduced when it also separates from its place.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the Humerus.
Know that the Humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
One of which is that it is dislocated to the side of the armpit towards the lower part. The second is that it is dislocated towards the side of the chest. And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the Humerus: and that happens rarely.
And it is not dislocated backwards, due to the scapula. And it is not dislocated forwards, due to the nerves.
And very often it is dislocated and comes out downwards towards the titillicum: especially in those whose flesh is scarce. Because it emerges in them quickly, and enters quickly.
However, in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, namely because it emerges with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
And perhaps it happens to some men through a blow or fall, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought to be due to that, because it has already been dislocated.
Therefore, it is necessary that you test it, until you stand on the certainty of it, and then proceed in its treatment.
And dislocation is recognized when it is turned downwards towards the tickle: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus. For you find a clear difference among them, and you find a concavity in the head of the humerus, and below the tickle, at the touch, the head of the humerus is as if it were an egg: and the sick person cannot bring their hand up to their ear, nor move it in all ways.
And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you find a clear touch, nor is it hidden.
And indeed, a simple reduction of this dislocation is possible when it is recent, or if the patient is a child.
And its reduction is that the attendant should raise his hand upwards. Then place your thumbs under its tickle, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place: and let the attendant raise his hand and extend it upwards. Then let him place it below, for it returns quickly indeed.
However, if it does not return by what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation that softens and soothes be administered, such as if the roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Then let the patient be laid on his back: and let a sphere and wool be placed under its tickle, which should be equal between gentleness and constriction.
Then let the physician place his heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the shoulder with force, and pull the patient's hand downwards.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you should have present a man longer than the patient, and let him stand on the side, and let him insert his shoulder under the patient's tickle: and lift the tickle upwards, until the patient is suspended in the air. And another attendant should pull the patient's hand downwards toward his belly. However, if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be hung with him to weigh him down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood should be fixed in the ground, whose head should be round in shape, like the sleeve of a mortar: which should not be thick, nor thin. Then let soft cloths be placed over the head of the wood beneath the patient, and let the patient stand along the length of the wood.
Then let his hand be extended downwards on one side, and let his body be extended on the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
If his reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you should take wood whose length is the size of two arms, and its width the size of four fingers, and its thickness the size of two fingers: which should have a round head, so that its entry into the depth of the joint may be eased, according to this form.
Then soft cloths are tied over the round head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Then place the wood under the patient's joint, so that the hand or arm is extended downwards over the wood; and the wood is tied to the support and arm and hand's extremity.
Then place the arm over a step of a ladder in width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body be suspended on the other side. The joint enters immediately.
When therefore its entry is completed in whichever manner is possible, then it is necessary that you place a sphere of equal size made of wool under the joint. Then place the prepared plaster from the mill's powder with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it revolves from above.
Then bind with a suitable bandage under the joint, and let the ligament be wrapped around the plaster from above, and let his hand be tied to his neck, and let it be released, and let not his hand be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that little food be given to the sick person until the limb is strengthened, because that is more rapid for its healing.
Then, after seven or five days, a larger one is placed, and it is exercised with movement. If therefore it is strengthened and does not soften, then it is now healed.
If however the joint dislocates repeatedly, due to the moisture that befalls it, or for some other reason, then it is necessary that a cautery with three openings be administered to it, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery.
If all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and constriction are applied repeatedly to it, and it is not strengthened, and it falls, and cannot be raised to its higher position, then know that its nerves which are to the head of the humerus are now cut, or stretched, or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
However, the reduction of a dislocation towards the chest and nipple, or to the rear, is done with pressing and stretching with the hands, until it returns, and further constriction and treatment are administered to it until it is healed.
If after healing, heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then the sick person should use the bath repeatedly until that heaviness is lessened, and it returns to its original nature.
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty; and indeed it is dislocated to all sides, and especially to the front, or to the back.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is readily apparent to the eye and to the touch, regardless of the manner in which it is dislocated. And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, that is made manifest to you. For the joint is hollowed out, and cannot double the arm, nor touch its shoulder with it.
And it is necessary that you hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to it.
For if a hot abscess occurs to it, its reduction becomes difficult, and perhaps it will not be healed at all, especially when it is to the rear. For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations, and causes more severe pain to them, and often death descends with it.
And its restoration, when it is of those that can be reduced, is that his hand should be extended with two hands, and his arm stretched out, and the physician's hands should be above and below the elbow, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he should double his hand with his hand, until he strikes with the base of his palm the elbow that is dislocated.
If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a very strong, forceful extension: and it is that two assistants should extend the arm; and two assistants should also hold it so that it is not moved during the extension.
Then the arm is to be revolved in every direction after a long doubled cloth, or a broad bandage, has been wrapped around it.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil, so that it may be among those things that aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease. Then he should drive the joint with a forceful thrust, until it returns.
And after its reduction, it is necessary to place a plaster upon it, in which there is astringency and desiccation with egg white: and a decent bandage should be applied. And let the arm be suspended from the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days.
Then let it be released. If therefore the joint is strengthened in its place, then loosen the bandage from it and leave it.
And if you see the joint not being properly bound, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it for a few days, until it is bound. Then loosen it.
If however heaviness occurs to it after the reduction of the joint, and the disposition is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is lined, or place upon the joint fat of a ram's buttock. Then it is to be bandaged, and leave it upon it day and night. Then remove it, and immerse it in a bath. When therefore it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction. Then repeat upon it the aleliati in one, and second, and third time with the entrance of the bath, until it is soothed.
And if you wish, place upon it a warm, moist cow dung, warmed with butter, and bind over it.
Do that several times. For it is soothed and returns to its proper state.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of Almahassem.
The joint between the arm and hand, the Mahassem, is often dislocated.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy. Unlike the other joints. However, speed is necessary in reducing its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place is suppurated; or a hot abscess occurs in it.
And the reduction of its dislocation is to place the weak hand's Mahassem on a board, and let the assistant extend his hand; and let the physician place his palm on the prominence of the joint, and push it until it returns.
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded to the back of the hand: then the weak man shall place the back of his hand on the board at the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be internally on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand be placed on the board, so that the hand of the physician falls upon the very prominence of the joint.
If therefore it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster for the abscess; and leave it, and do not repeat it.
For if it does not tolerate it, nor can you bring about its reduction after days have passed, but the joint remains according to its twisting: and it does not harm the sick person anything except that the hand softens, and cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves are severed, or worn out.
Therefore there is no skill in it, except that it be bound with a cautery near its fall. And perhaps that does not help anything.
When therefore Almahassem does not return, then place on it the plaster, which we have described. Then it shall be bound, and left for five days: afterwards it shall be unbound and left, and the hand exercised.
If however its movement is deprived, and something serious occurs in it: then gently warm it with heated water, and friction repeatedly, until it is eased.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the fingers.
When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or from the finger to the back of the palm, or to its front: then extend the finger, and drive the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and let it be for two days.
Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is straightened on that day of its own.
When therefore it is night, bind it according to the account itself: and do not cease to loosen it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Do that for several days, until it is strengthened.
And similarly do with it, if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and bind it to that same part, and do your first operation with it, until it is healed.
And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the spinal column.
When it happens to someone that the spinal column or the neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death quickly comes upon the sick person.
And a sign of this is that the sick person's excretion comes out involuntarily, and they cannot hold it; and often some of his limbs become soft, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them; or a single vertebra is removed from its place.
For often it is removed, which happens often in the removal of them to four parts.
Therefore, that which is removed backwards is called Gibbosity.
However, the treatment for it is to consider, if the gibbosity occurred from childhood, then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
However, in those cases which occur from an accident, or a blow, or similar things to these, the ancients have already described methods of treatment in lengthy discourse. Of which much does not return with profit.
I, however, have abbreviated it, from which little excuses much of it, from my proximity to its intention: and by my exposition of it, and I formed its instrument in a different way from that in which they showed it and explained it.
Therefore, I say that in gibbosity which occurs on the anterior part, there is no remedy, nor healing from it.
And similarly in that which happens on both sides as well.
And it is not cured from them, unless that which happens in the back properly, with what I relate: and it is, that the infirm person be stretched out upon their face upon an even platform near a wall: and that moist straw be spread under it, so that their chest is not injured.
Then let a straight piece of wood be fixed in a hole in the ground, at the end of the platform, roughly at the level of his head; and another piece of wood roughly at the level of his feet at the other end of the platform; and let an assistant hold the wood, and let it not be firmly fixed in the hole. And another assistant hold the other.
Then wrap around the head of the sick person, and under their armpits, a soft, strong bandage; and extend the end of the bandage to the wood which is by his head; and tie it to it.
Then tighten another bandage above his armpits, and above his knees, and at his hips. Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the other piece of wood that is by his feet.
Then let each assistant pull on the bandage towards the piece of wood, and do not remove the two pieces of wood from their positions in which they are fixed; but let them not be firmly secured, as we have said.
And let the physician place his palms on the vertebra with force, until it returns to its place; or let him place a board upon it. Then he ties his feet to the board, until it returns to its place.
If, however, it does not return with this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three arms' lengths. And make a hollow in the wall of which we said was near the sick person, a place for the end of the board to enter. Then place the middle of the board over the vertebra. And let the physician place his feet on the other end. And pull tightly until the vertebra is constricted and returns to its place.
Then if you wish, operate with a turning tool held in your hand: and it is, that you fix in the ground near the head of the sick person, at the furthest point of the footstool, two pieces of wood, whose length is that of one arm: and near his head, at the furthest point of the footstool, two pieces of wood.
And let the length between each piece of wood be one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place, through which the turning tool runs: and let each piece of wood be firmly secured in the ground, so that it does not move at all.
And let a round piece of wood be inserted; and the turning tool is in which the ligament is revolved in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its extremity is a hole, in which a piece of wood is fixed, whose length is a palm together with that which is revolved: and in the other two pieces of wood it is similarly situated.
Then tighten the ligaments which you have tied on the chest of the sick person with the turning tool which is at his head; and the ligaments which you have tied on his legs with the turning tool which is at his feet.
Then let a servant stand at each turning tool, who may turn his hand with the cord, with which the turning tool is revolved: and the physician shall adjust the Spondyle, according to what we have said.
This is the form of the turning tool, which follows.
Then, after the Spondyle returns and the place is adjusted, it is necessary to apply a drying plaster with egg white. Then, a bandage. Then place a piece of wood, whose width is three fingers, or approximately that, over the plaster. And its length the amount that covers the hump and the healthy part of the Spondyle.
Then tie it with the ligature which we said. And let the sick person use subtle nourishment until he is healed.
If something of eminence remains in the place at the end of the cure, then it is necessary that medicines that soften and soothe be administered, with the administration of the board which we described for a long time. And now a lead plate is administered into it.
And sometimes eminence occurs in the last vertebra of the spine, and it is thought to be caused by dislocation, and that is the bone which is now prominent. Therefore, it is not fitting to presume upon him with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
Concerning the cure of a dislocated shoulder.
Know that dislocation of the shoulder joint, and the humerus joint, happens only as a complete dislocation; nor does anything happen to them that happens to other joints from a slight displacement and concavity.
And indeed the shoulder joint is dislocated according to four parts. That is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.
And it is mostly dislocated inward; and it is little dislocated forward and backward.
And the treatment of its inward dislocation is this: because when you connect the healthy leg of the sick person with the sick leg, it is longer; and the knee of the sick person is more prominent than that of the healthy one, and the sick person cannot bend his foot at the groin; and there is a place which follows the groin, suppurated with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh has already reached there.
And the sign of him who has a dislocation outward is that the occurrences are opposite to these occurrences.
And the sign of him who has a dislocation forward is that he extends the healthy leg to its limit; however, he does not bend it without pain in the knee; and if he attempts to walk, he cannot move it forward; and his urine is retained, and his groin is suppurated, and upon walking, his heel is striking the ground.
And the sign of him who has a dislocation backward is that he does not extend his knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is at the place of the ilium.
The reduction of these kinds of dislocations, however, is that you should consider whether the dislocation is ancient, which has already grown old with the one who has it. Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its position, then there is no cure for it at all. Therefore, it is not necessary to make a complete presumption about it.
However, in the one whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of dislocation, then hasten to this, to wish to join the joint, and to extend it inwardly and outwardly, and to move it to the right and left: for perhaps it returns, and does not need another treatment.
If, however, it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and let him extend his leg from the lower part; either with his hands, or with a bandage that is tied above his leg above the knee; and let another assistant extend his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under his toes. Then he should tighten with a gentle bandage over the root of the thigh, and hold the end of the other bandage.
And let its extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the crotch, or from the posterior to the part of the back.
And let the extension of all of them be at one time, until the sick person is raised with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
And this species of extension is a common species of the four species.
If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every species that I will say about its own cure.
In its own reduction, indeed, when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the sick person be laid on his healthy side. Then he should place a bandage over the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh, and the place that is below the groin. Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the pubis.
Then let another strong servant take his arms, and reduce the thick part of the sick person's thigh, and extend it outward with a violent extension. For now it returns to its place.
And this method is easier than the other methods of treating this limb.
However, if it resists you, and does not submit to you in this treatment at all: then it is necessary that the two feet of the sick person be tied together with a strong, gentle bandage, over the two heels and over the two knees; and let the length of each be from its counterpart in quantity of four fingers; and let the sick leg be extended more than the other by a quantity of two fingers.
Then let the sick person be suspended over a wooden beam, which is in the house; and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Then command a strong young man to hold the head of the thigh; and let another young man hold the sick person; and let another young man, holding the thigh with strength, urge it; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
However, in its own return, when the dislocation is outward, it is necessary that the sick person lie upon a raised platform, according to what we have narrated concerning the humpbacked person. And a bandage should be tied around his/her sick leg and across his/her chest.
Then place two pieces of wood, one at his/her feet, and the other at his/her head. Then place a further piece of wood in the middle of the platform, firmly fixed; upon which let moist cloths be wrapped, so that it does not injure the sick person; and let the wood be between his/her thighs, so that he/she is not pulled downwards by extension.
Then let every attendant pull on his/her side, and let the physician equalize the reduction with his/her hand.
If therefore it yields to the return, it will be good.
And if not, place it upon the board itself, and press it, just as we said in the case of a hump, evenly. However, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his/her healthy side.
And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary that the sick person's leg be pulled quickly; and it is according to this same account upon a raised platform; and let the physician place the palm of his right hand upon the sick person's groin. Then he constricts it with the other hand, and with that constriction places it stretched downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is towards the rear: then it is not necessary that the sick person be stretched downwards and be raised from the ground; rather, it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard object, as is necessary, as is also done if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about his lying on both hips: and it is upon his face, and the ligaments stretched: according to what we said recently.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also upon the place to which the joint emerges, when the reduction is completed as is necessary.
And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the sick person; and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his leg and expands it without excuse, then know that the limb has now returned, as is necessary; then join the two thighs and apply a plaster, and bind it with a bandage, that is, a roller; so that the hip is not moved to any parts; and let the sick person adhere to rest for three days or four.
Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is now firm; therefore, release the sick person to walk.
And if you see any softening, then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding; and let it be also for three days.
Then loosen it and make him/her slow in walking on both sides for several days, until he/she is well strengthened.
Concerning the dislocation of the Knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways. It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, namely backwards.
And it is not dislocated forwards.
And a sign of its dislocation is that you should instruct the sick person to apply his leg to his thigh. If however it does not adhere to the thigh: then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all the ways of its dislocation is that you should make the sick person sit upright, so that he already extends his leg if he can over it, and adheres your back to his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Then make his knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over his knee. Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength. And another attendant should extend his foot, until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh with ease, not with effort.
Then bandage it, and make the leg adhere to the thigh. Then tie them together with a bandage for three days, or four. Then loosen them.
And let the infirm person not use walking for some days, until he is healed.
If, however, its reduction is refused by you, then administer a strong extension with bandages, whose description preceded in the treatment of a dislocation, until it returns.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the Calcaneus.
The calcaneus sometimes is removed by a small displacement, and sometimes is dislocated completely. And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the Calcaneus swollen, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
The treatment for its displacement is easy repositioning: and it is that it should be extended gently with the hands, and adjusted until it returns.
In treating it, however, when it is dislocated completely, it is necessary that you have the sick person sit upright, and a strong assistant hold him firmly from the back of his back, in the middle of it.
Then, hold his foot with your right hand from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the ankle joint.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. Then with the left two times.
Then extend with the left, and push the foot's chest with the right towards the leg without effort.
Do that twice, as we have described.
Then push the foot's chest towards the leg a third time, and you pull the heel.
If therefore it returns in one time, or in two according to this method, and you see the foot is straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, because it returns.
If however its reduction is prevented by what we have described, then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a firmly planted peg in the ground, so that it falls between his thighs; and you have now wrapped a cloth over it, so that it does not harm the sick person.
Then let the attendant take his thigh; afterward let another attendant extend the foot, either with their hands or with a bandage that ties around the ankle. Then let each attendant extend against the extension of their counterpart; and let the peg stand between the sick person's two thighs, holding him so that his body is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Then the physician should straighten the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant should hold the healthy leg downwards. For the dislocation returns with speed.
Therefore, when the dislocation returns, and its return is clear to you, then place a plaster and a bandage, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And you must be careful or wary of the nerves which are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not too tight on them, and injures them.
Then leave it for two days, or three. If the bandage softens, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and forbid the weak person from walking for forty days. If, however, he attempts to walk before that space of time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened on him, and be corrupted, and not receive healing afterwards.
If a hot abscess occurs to him, then it is necessary that you administer to its sedation what our narrative previously described elsewhere regarding treatment, and a fomentation, until it is removed.
Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
It is necessary that what is dislocated from them be brought back into place with a slight extension, without difficulty; indeed, it is easy.
If however the dislocation is in some of the dorsal knots of the foot, then it is necessary that the sick person place their foot on a level place on the ground, or on a board; and it should be standing as if walking.
Then you should stand and place your foot upon that which protrudes from those joints. Then press it with your foot with force, until it returns and you see it is now in its proper place, and no protrusion appears.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot, one that will encompass the entire foot, and have two ends. Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days. Then loosen it and keep him from walking for many days, until it is strong and secure from relapse.
Concerning the types of dislocation with wound or fracture.
When something of that sort occurs, and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often results.  Because of this, it is not fitting for anyone to presume to treat such a case unless they are prudent in the art, long-practiced, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous.  And they should use medicines at the outset that soothe only hot abscesses, and leave the sick person to divine judgment. Unless you see, or hope for, health from ruin with the gentleness of illness, and in which something of hope appears. Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
If, therefore, the limb returns as we desire, then administer a regimen that soothes the abscess, and treat the wound with whatever suitable drying ointments are appropriate.
If, however, the dislocation is with a fracture, and separate bone protrusions occur, then attempt their removal, and do in this what we have said in simpler illnesses from what has preceded concerning their locations.
And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, according to my previous instruction to you.
For that is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more beneficial to your body among those in your time.
