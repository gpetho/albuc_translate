Dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and the return is easier than other joints.
However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the very hour it is dislocated, before the area swells, or a hot abscess develops there.
And the reduction is done by placing the injured hand on a table, and the practitioner extends the hand, and carefully sets it evenly, placing their palm over the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns to place.
However, you must check if it is properly in place;
then have the patient place the back of their hand on a table for the extension and reduction.
And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient should place the back of their hand on the table, and the physician should place their hand over the appearance of the joint.
If it returns to place now, that is good.
If not, bind it with soothing plasters for hot abscesses, and leave it thus without restarting.
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put it in place after a few days, the joint will remain crooked;
and it doesn't harm the patient except that the hand is weakened, and he cannot grip anything at all:
then know that the nerves are cut, or the artery;
so there is no other solution but to burn with a cautery next to the break, and perhaps nothing else will help.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster that we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then untie it and leave it like that.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, then wet it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
