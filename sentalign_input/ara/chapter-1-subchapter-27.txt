Chapter Twenty-Seven
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If pain arises from the liver due to coldness and moisture or due to thick wind, so that it deviates excessively from its natural temperament, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the division, but it is not effective.
The patient should lie on his back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink in this shape and this exact size on the liver, below the cartilage where the human elbow ends.
And there should be the thickness of a finger between each cautery mark, and the cautery should be lengthwise along the body, straight, and do not press your hand with the cautery iron.
And the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be half of it, no more, and the patient should be standing on his feet; if he is not standing, then he should be lying down with his legs extended and his arms raised, and this is the image of the cautery iron.
You can cauterize these marks with the scalpel cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be careful not to go too deep in the cauterization, burning the entire skin and burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so be aware of it.
