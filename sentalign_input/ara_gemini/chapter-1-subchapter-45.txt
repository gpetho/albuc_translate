Chapter forty-five on cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestines and omentum descend to the testicle, and this is recent and new,
then you should order the patient to abstain from food for the day and that he use laxatives that will bring down the stool from his belly.
Then he should lie down on his back in front of you and you order him to hold his breath until the omentum or intestines protrude.
Then you push it back with your finger.
Then you mark with ink under the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a half-circle, its ends towards the upper part of the body.
Then you heat a cautery, its shape being this:
Until it becomes white and emits sparks.
Then return the intestine or omentum to its cavity.
Then an assistant places his hand on the area so that the intestine does not protrude.
And the patient's legs have been spread apart, and a pillow has been placed under him.
And another assistant holds his legs, and another on his chest holds his hands.
Then apply the cautery iron to the mark itself.
And your hand holding the cautery iron should be steady and straight, and you hold it until it reaches the bone.
Or repeat it again if it did not reach the bone the first time.
And be very careful of the protrusion of the intestine while cauterizing, so that you do not burn it, which would cause the patient either death or a great affliction.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed.
And the cautery iron for children should be gentle, according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with ghee until the char of the fire disappears.
Then treat it with other ointments until it heals.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary to make his food, for the duration of his treatment, something that softens his stomach so that the intestine does not protrude during straining and defecation.
Then, if he wants to get up after the forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.
And reduce exertion, and fullness from food and drink, and loud shouting.
For if he follows this regimen in this way, he will be completely healed, God willing.
And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing.
As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is in its early stages, if you want it not to increase, cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery according to its size.
And let what you burn of the skin be like two-thirds of it.
Then treat it with what we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing.
And some of the predecessors have mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery iron in this manner:
After you have marked the hernia with ink,
and make the horizontal line on the upper side of the hernia and the other line below,
and you apply your hand in the middle with a single nail-shaped cautery,
and the first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
