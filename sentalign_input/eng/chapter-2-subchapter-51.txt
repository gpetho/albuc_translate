 CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE.
On the amputation of warts occurring on the belly.
 Some people often get warts on the belly and on the rest of the body, called fungous warts, because of their resemblance to fungi.
They have a slender pedicle and a broad head, the edges of which are sometimes inverted ; and some are small, whereas others of them grow very big.
I myself once saw a man who had two warts on his belly that looked more like fungi than anything else; they were white and had thin pedicles.
Their edges were inverted and had split open, and a humour flowed continually from them.
I amputated them both and weighed them: one came to about eighteen ounces, and the other six ounces.
This is the operation for amputating them: examine the patient carefully, and if he be of a humid temperament and the colour of the warts be white, and if they are soft, with a thin stalk, amputate them with a broad scalpel.
But you should also have at hand cauteries in a fire; for often in amputating them there is much haemorrhage.
So, if the bleeding be a hindrance to you, be quick and cauterize them.
On the other hand if you see that the patient is frightened and dreads the cutting of them with the scalpel, take a wire of stout lead, and ligature this type of wart and leave for two days.
Then increase the stricture by the lead wire and go on doing this as it sinks into the wart, until the wart is cut through and spontaneously falls away with no trouble.
But if the warts have stout pedicles there is some risk and fear in the cutting of them, especially those that occur on the belly.
Sometimes, however, you can cut away the half, or some part, and then cauterize to prevent recurrence.
Then dress until the wound is healed.
 But beware of trying to cut away growths that are dark in colour, with little sensation and hideous in appearance, for they are cancerous tumours.
I shall soon be mentioning cancer.
