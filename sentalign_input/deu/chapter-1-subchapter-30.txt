Chapter Thirty:
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the disease of the spleen using the method we have mentioned in the previous section and your treatment does not work, then cauterize it in one of three ways, all of which are correct. One way is to make three or four linear cauterizations along the length of the spleen, similar to the cauterizations for the liver, as previously described.
There should be a space the width of a finger or a little more between each cauterization, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as described for the liver.
Do not press too hard with the cautery; the patient should lie on their back.
Another method of cauterization is to heat a cautery with two edges, as mentioned in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and lift the tendon located in the area of the spleen where the patient lies on their left side.
And your lifting should be along the length of the body, so that the cauterizations are made along the width of the body.
Then insert the two heated edges into the area to penetrate the tendon from the other side.
Then remove the cautery; now four cauterizations are made.
If you prefer, cauterize with a cautery that has three edges.
Then treat the cauterization wound until it stops discharging pus after a few days, as this is more effective than previous treatments.
