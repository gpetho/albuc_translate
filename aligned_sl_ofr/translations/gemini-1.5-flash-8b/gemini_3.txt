O you, very dear children, I have completed this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, together with its fulfillment, and have made the end through its expositions and its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I would complete it with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is very difficult in our region and is completely unfamiliar, its science is lost and cut off, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that the hands have changed. And from this came the error and the vanity, and the intentions are closed and the science is distant.
Now it seems to me that I wish to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abridgment; and will assemble the forms of cautery irons and other instruments of the work with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is estranged. And it is necessary for whoever undertakes this to surpass in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and junctions and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and their number, and the movement and the stationary veins, and the place of their exit.
And therefore Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable about the things previously mentioned, let him beware lest he fall into error and kill men;
so that I have often seen many of those who meddle in this science abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish man who cut an abscess of scrofulas or a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; whereupon so much blood flowed out that the woman fell dead into his hands.
And I saw another man who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so he took away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and saw the condition of the sick man and the size of the stone, and knew well that if it were cut, he would die.
And I saw another man who treated a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break there was a wound;
and the ignorant physician pressed the break against the wound with strong bandages, and did not leave the wound any slack, and left it thus for a time;
and he commanded him not to loosen it at all;
and remained thus until the leg, foot, and everything were swollen and came to ruin.
I was called to go to him, and hastened to come and untie the leg; and when I loosened it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But nevertheless, the corruption had already taken hold in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption continued to spread through the limb until the entire limb was lost.
And I saw another sore that opened the festering abscess, and then inflamed due to the malice of its affliction.
For a sore, when it is pure of melancholic humor, it is not appropriate to touch it with iron unless it is in such a place that one can remove all that is corrupted.
And therefore, my good son, it is necessary that you know that the work of the hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in many ways;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore, it is necessary that you guard yourselves, so that foolish critics cannot speak ill of you.
So take your weapons in your hands, and undertake your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that through the grace of God you come to a successful outcome and are praised;
and leave the terrible diseases of grievous sickness;
and remove your weapons from those that make you fearful, and have faith in yourselves so that you can pass from this world to the next with glory.
Galen said in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness, lest you be called a foolish doctor.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is about fire cauteries and sharp medicine cauteries, and this chapter is organized from the head down to the feet;
and of the shapes of instruments, and of the iron cauteries, and of everything that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and of similar things;
and the chapter is organized and the shapes of the instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and it is ordered from the head down to the feet, and of the shapes of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I say the quality of the help and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help, and of harm, are the longest speech and the subtlest science and the secret answer.
and many wise men spoke of this, and agreed upon it.
and their words are of little use to me, for I fear length.
I say that cautery helps universally in all complexions where there is matter, except for two complexions. that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a hot and dry complexion with matter, some debated and said that cautery is of great help; and the others said the opposite: that cautery is of no use for an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and should not be used to treat a hot illness with heat, nor with dryness;
and the one who said the opposite claimed that cautery is of great help for hot and dry illnesses that occur in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it to be true on several occasions through experimentation.
And certainly, no one should interfere except those who have tested it, and who know through long practice the chapter on cauteries, and the diversity of human temperaments, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the nature of the time.
Of other temperaments we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the doctors assembled and agreed to cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and only affects the member that is being cauterized, and does little harm to other members.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, and cause serious healing problems in the members. and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, due to its strength and the goodness of its substance, does not cause this harm, if there is no excess.
And this I have found through experiment and through the length of service and study I have put into the art, and it is based on the truth of things.
And for this I apologize for the length of the speech, for I do not wish to deprive you of the secret contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels diseases from the body, just as the philosopher demonstrates it. or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauteries should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm that arises is thus subdued by the help of cautery; and especially if the cauteries are necessary for pain, urgently and quickly, before greater harm can befall the limb.
And do not think about it at all, dear son, as foolish men do; for the sickness that is cured by cautery has no return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not as they believe, because cauteries are only a medicine that changes the constitution, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and are more valuable than other medicines because of their speed of action and the power of their work and their influence.
And a powerful thing it is that the illness sometimes comes according to the constitution of the sick person and the location of the illness and its power;
and superfluities gather within him from the consumption of foods and similar things, unless cauteries are administered where there are few superfluities and moisture, such as cauteries for toothache, and similar things, and such pain does not return; But this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cauteries are called the last resort in medicine, and that is true;
but they do not believe that cauteries are effective after other remedies, but their intentions are false, and cauteries are the last resort in medicine because when we administer various treatments for an illness and they are ineffective, then we administer the cautery, and it is effective.
Therefore, it is clear that cauteries are the last resort in medicine, not according to the intentions of foolish people.
The ancients said that cauteries made of gold are more effective than those made of iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the nobility of its substance;
and they said that the place cauterized does not cause corruption, but this is not true, for I have experienced it, and have found it to be true in some people;
and cauteries of gold are more effective than those of iron, as they said. And yet, when you heat a gold instrument, you cannot tell when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly;
and if it is heated too much; so do they do with fire; and thus there is enough hindrance.
Now I have ordered this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way might be easier to find.
These cauteries are good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two that are done because of an illness called "soda," and because of many humours that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all illnesses that come from coldness, such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be cleansed by a dissolving medicine, purifying the head for three or four nights, according to what the virtue and age and habit of the patient can endure; and then remove the head of the patient.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and put his hands on his feet;
Afterwards, place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and leave where your middle fingers will go, then warm the cautery called "olivare," of which this is the form: And place it on the marked spot, and move your hand down and tighten it little by little while turning; then quickly lift your hand, and examine the spot if you see the bone slightly protruding; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterward take a little of this, and put it in water and soften the cotton inside, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days;
afterward put softened cotton in butter; and leave it there until the burning is gone; afterward treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon," until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it cleanses itself; and for this reason, use ointments.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery until part of the bone is burned, and then the burned portion of the bone should be removed and the wound healed.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on for so long, and apply such force that one removes a piece of bone as wide as a spindle that women use in their spindles, so that the humors may drain out;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time; after that, one should treat and close it.
And these two methods of cauteries do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some men where there is a fear of pain;
and moreover it seems to me that I should leave it;
for the shoulder is weakened by the continuous dissolving of its nature, as we testify in other limbs;
and even when the patient's shoulder is weak by nature, and the first appearance of cautery is safer and milder for me, and with this I use it in this case for healing.
When chronic pain affects the entire head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills called "cochie," and head-cleansing agents, oils, and plasters; and if the cautery we have previously described is applied, and it is not effective. Beware if the patient's shoulder is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize below that cautery a little, as we have said above. Afterwards, apply cautery to each horn of the shoulder down to the bone, as we have said before, and apply cautery to the place called "vasselz"; and that is the place where cupping is applied; and ease your hand so that you do not go all the way to the bone: the patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of that elsewhere;
and the cauteries of the horns should be finer than those used to cauterize the middle of the shoulder, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When sudden pain comes in a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head has been purged by purifying medicines, and the other cures that I have described in the division of illnesses have been performed, and none of it is of any use: Then, one applies cauteries in two ways, that is to say, with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, remove the skin and cut it into 1 or 2 pieces, and then slice the temple where the pain is located in such a way that you can place the garlic slice beneath the skin;
and when it is placed, tie it tightly and leave it like that for 12 hours; and then untie it and remove the garlic slice, and leave the wound like that for 2 or 3 days; then place a piece of lint soaked in butter over it until the pus comes out.
After that, treat with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the chapter on burning medicines.
The cautery with iron is done according to this method. Heat the cautery with what is its form:
And it is called "closed" because the head is shaped like a lid or enclosure, with a small curve, and a small appearance in the middle;
and place it on the painful area, hold your hand and turn the iron slightly, until half of the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so the artery does not burn, which is outside, and a large amount of blood flows out.
Afterwards, put cotton in a wet cloth, and place it on the area for 3 days; then put moistened cotton in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare," at the very tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine, which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat migraine as we have previously discussed in the divisions of illnesses, and it does not help, and you see that the cauteries previously discussed, of medicine and iron, do not suffice, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white;
and so mark over the painful area a line of half a finger in length, and remove your hand once, and take care that you do not cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and be wary of the jawbone that moves when one chews, and that the nerve only regards its movement and that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of bleeding from the artery when it is cut, or a cut causes great fear, and especially to one who does not know it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work half-finished;
but I will tell you how one stops blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is pertinent in this book.
And if you see that this cautery does not suffice for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have said, and cure the wound until it is healed;
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that and more helpful.
of the pain in the ears from cold.
When pain in the ear comes from cold, and you have tried dissolving medicines and other cures as we said in the division, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery which is called "poins", of which this is the shape:
Then prick all around the diseased ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move slightly upwards from the root of the ear once you have marked the spot. and make 10 pricks around each ear;
then treat the area until it is healed.
of the torture of the mouth
Tortures that must be treated with cautery are no more than those caused by phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of disease;
and do not apply cautery to those that arise from dryness and spasms of the nerves.
When you treat this type of torture caused by phlegm from hydras and purges of the head and gargles, and this does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another slightly outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the apparent healthy part, and apply it to the head of the ear slightly below the horn of the head, and another on the temple as long as a finger; and leave the cautery there until half the heart is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it resembles the scalpel we have mentioned before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
after treating the place as I have said before, until it is healed.
When the apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it is of no use, and the patient has no fever, then apply four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one on the place called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, give the patient large herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
After this, treat the entire head of the patient, and apply a mustard plaster, as written in the treatise on plasters, to the patient's occiput.
and this is the manner of cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If it is thus healed, it is good; and if it is not, then apply three cauteries from the middle of the head, descending down to the neck, and have one inch of space between each cautery.
and treat it as the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is enduring, then apply one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two horns, and treat it until it is healed;
and let the cauteries be what is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of sores and of what we have said before;
After this, clean the patient's head, then cauterize it in the middle of the head and on each horn, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
And if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the ailment is severe, then apply four cauteries to the spine of the back; and leave them until the majority of the heart is burned, and lift your hand; after the treatment until it is healed, and let the cauteries, which are called "olivare" as we have said before.
of epilepsy
The epileptic should not use strong cauteries except those who are phlegmatic, and the brain must first be cleansed with years and other treatments that we have described in the section when the patient is severely suffering from taking medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, then make them gargle and chew, cleansing the brain often with good foods;
After the head is shaved, cauteries are made, as we said before, and cauteries on the blood vessels and on each horn; And if the patient is strong and suffering, cauteries are applied as I have said for paralysis and body softening, on the spine of the back and neck, and the cauteries should be olive-oil based according to the method I have described.
If the patient is a child, make subtle cauteries according to this method:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or moistures are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for those with paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities incline towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink something to cleanse the brain, according to what is stated earlier in the division.
Afterwards, treat the patient's head; Afterwards, make a well-made linen bandage, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and the patient sits cross-legged, and be held firmly on all sides;
Next, present the liniment, and it is worth a mixture of old beeswax; and heat it over a moderate fire, so that the patient can tolerate it; Afterwards, empty the circle within the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient each week once, with other good treatment, until they are healthy.
Or if you wish to cauterize it by making several pricks with the cautery.
This manner of cautery softens the brain equally;
and then put on cotton soaked in butter and goose fat.
of the water from the eyes When water comes first to the eyes, by the signs I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink something that cleanses the head, and keep it from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath several times on an empty stomach.
After that, order him to rest his head, and perform cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the discharge of water is on both eyes together, or on one if the discharge is on one;
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and be careful of blood flowing, and if you see too much blood coming out, stop it with whatever power you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution how you will stop it;
and sometimes cautery or a hot iron is applied under the two bones behind.
and if one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then apply the cautery that I mentioned at the beginning of the descending ailment to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or a hot iron under the two bones; and if there is further need, then cauterize wisely above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient three nights of gruel to drink; after he heals the head, and he makes a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries of the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery, that you not cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery called "clavilis":
When the tissue of the eye is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery which is called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows, as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the tissue is burned, according to the manner I have said.
from the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelids are turned inward, and prick the eye, and one makes cauteries according to two manners: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For cautery by fire, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they have grown and are even, then put the patient on your lap; then draw a figure on the skin of the eyes, shaped like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the sign be beside the hairs;
then put cotton moistened in egg white and parsley poultice on the eye, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape:
After cauterize over the figure you marked, little by little, many times, that the heart be burnt in that spot;
and the signs of the efficacy of the work are that you see the skin receded, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it thus for three days, then put cotton moistened in butter until the burn is removed; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterwards the hair grows back, and the skin is softened, then recommence the cautery on that same spot, just as you did at first;
and if the hair has disappeared, then cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural position, and is even, and the hair does not prick the eye.
The cauterizing with burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hair grow long and even, then make a shape of a myrtle leaf from parchment;
then take some French soap and live charcoal, of each one a third, and grind well together; and do it quickly, so it doesn't cool down, then spread it onto the shape you made, like a myrtle leaf, and put it on the skin around the eyes; and if the patient has pain in only one eye, then one should work on that one, and if in both, likewise; and put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white;
and the patient's head should be in good health, and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly and move it every time the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for it feels like a burn, just like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine from your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, remove the bandage, and see if you see the paper raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by an incision; and if it is so, then it is well.
If not, then put more medicine on the spot where the medicine hasn't worked, until your actions are equal, and your eyes are focused.
Then put moistened cotton in butter until the burned heart is healed, then treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary for you to be very careful in your work, take great care that no medicine gets in your eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterward, and the hairs prick in the eye, then recommence the medicine on the spot that has softened from the paper properly, as you did before. After treating it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size and smallness, and according to this, let your constrictions be.
And let not the right path be hidden from the one who studies this art.
Of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not work, then you must cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to put his head in your lap; and let the attendant hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move, nor does he shift his head;
then put wet cotton in egg white or in juice of parsley on the eye;
then heat the cautery which is such:
and has a head at the top, like the shape of a pointed roof, of which the cautery is formed;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a tent;
however, this one that is pointed is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and extract the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and extract the swelling;
after, apply the hot cautery firmly, and hold your hand to the cautery on the part near the eye, so that your hand does not cause harm; and place the cautery in the grease of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you come to the beginning of the cautery, right up to the bone, that would be good. If not, repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for 3 days;
after, apply moistened cotton in butter, and treat it with desiccated ointment until it heals, and if 40 days pass and it does not heal, apply corrosive liquid medicine until the bone is exposed; and do the rest according to what he would do in his chapter.
And there is a way of cautery for fistulas that none of the ancients said. Understand the fistula, and make the place; after, place in the fissure a subtle cauterizing material of which this is the form: and there is made a quantity of a [three]-part of lead; and hold your hand on the cauterizing material firmly, and let the patient not move at all, lest the melted lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one places on the patient's eye a cotton soaked in egg white or in water:
the lead will burn the fistula's location, and heal it with marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good. If not, it is necessary to administer a cut to the nose, and to return the fistula to the nose's body according to what is fitting in its proper place.
cracks in the lips Often cracks occur in the lips, which are called "poil," especially in the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery according to this form:
And apply it quickly to those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterward, treat the area with a plaster until it is healed.
When an abscess forms at the root of the throat, or in the uvula, or the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, afterward it causes decay and rottenness and grows old and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have described in divisions, and it does no good: then it is necessary that you use a cautery according to the size of the fistula; afterward, cauterize the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the backmost part;
and do so once or twice, after the treatment we have described in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is thus healed, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and that is of no value, then place the patient's head on your own sound (healthy) one; afterward, heat the cautery, whose form will be shown here after, in such a way that you place a rod upon the tooth;
and quickly place the hot cautery inside, and hold your hand so long that the patient feels the heat coming to the root of the tooth;
afterward, remove your hand and repeat the cautery according to your will;
afterward, let the patient fill their mouth with salty water, and let it soak for an hour and rinse thoroughly.
And in this way the tooth that was moving is strengthened, and the inflamed gums are restrained, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
of the pain of the teeth
When toothache comes from cold, whether there is cold or true cold, and the remedies of medicine are not effective, then there is need for cautery in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter, and put it on the end of an iron or copper spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and place it on the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it cools;
and thus do often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and put on a hot iron until the heat reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take a rod of iron or copper, and it should be thick enough so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth;
then heat the cautery, with which the shape will come after, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools;
Do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then apply the cooling force.
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make cautery of whatever head you wish, and according to what you are able;
And this is the form of the cautery:
of the scrofulas When the scrofulas are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head, of which the form comes after, and have two openings for the fumes to exit on the cautery from the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or where it is necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and place moistened cotton in butter until the burning is removed;
afterward treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When moisture overcomes the channels of the lungs, and especially when this comes from a cold temperament, then the patient must first be purged by solving medicines;
afterward, apply cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to reach the throat itself, and do not burn the heart even a little.
Afterward, apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let the cautery be called "clavile" of which we have the form before.
and treat the area as we have said before until it is healed.
When the cough and lung disease are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is long-standing, then apply two cauteries on the ribs in empty spaces. and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cauteries, which are called "clavile," be according to the form that has been previously described.
And if you wish, apply a cautery by pricking all the way through, the cautery called "poins," of which the form is shown previously in the treatment of ear ailments;
and let the pricks be up to thirty, or even more.
After the treatment, follow what has been previously stated, and let the cauteries be in three rows according to this form:
And because of this, the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on their back and on their side; Then raise the heart that is within the titillite to the tips of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inside, then heat the cautery that has two nerves, of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces the ribs, and the cautery's shape would be like four cauteries combined;
and for this, a cautery with three nerves is made, so that the shape of the cauterization is six cauteries;
and the nerves are like the thinness of a tent, and this is the shape of the cautery with three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added on top of this, so that there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, place the cautery on the crushed pieces with thread; Afterwards, have the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well supported.
And if it is dislocated above, which rarely happens, then place the cautery on the thick part of the cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed and the patient is healthy.
When cold and much moisture enter the stomach, until it is reduced to its complexion, and phlegm is multiplied within, and with the customary treatments it is of no benefit, then the patient must be placed on their back, and extend their legs and arms. After this, apply three cauteries; one under the breastbone, the size of a finger, with the cautery's full length; and two cauteries on the outside of the two sides, so that the arrangement of cauteries forms a three-angled figure, and there is such spacing between them that when they release pus, they do not join together.
And let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without joining:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
And whoever is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and marking on the stomach as many points as you wish. Then cauterize it with the entire cautery called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When the liver suffers pain from cold, moisture, and large wind, as it is improperly put out of its natural complexion by superfluities; And if the patient is cured of what we have said in the divisions, and it does him no good, then the patient must be examined again. And apply three cauteries in this shape, form, and quantity on the liver, avoiding the hypochondria, the area where the ribs meet the man;
and have a space of one finger's width between each cautery. and let the cauteries be along the body, and do not press your hand too hard on the entire cautery;
and only half of the core should be burned, and the patient should stand upright.
and if he cannot, let him lie down, extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a scalpel, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and be careful not to burn all the core, for you would dry out the entire body; and that it does not reach the boil, for the core is very delicate in that spot, and you know this for certain.
When he has an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: If it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain not very strongly;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels intense pain.
And when this treatment should remove the mire, it is necessary that the patient be supported on their head;
and then drain the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is like a ray, of which here is the form: And cauterize the cautery until the heart is burned, and it comes down to the surface, until the wound is completely healed;
after the treatment, according to the treatment of the sores until they are healed;
and it is not appropriate for anyone to use this cautery except those who have long studied the art of medicine, and through whose hands these illnesses have run many times.
Then he can work boldly, and yet it seems to me that it is better to let it alone.
about cautery with a burning iron
The ancients said that one should make cauteries with the roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: Take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and as thick and as long as your fingers; and soak it in oil, and heat it in the fire, and cauterize one cautery between the jawbone and the neck, and two small cauteries a little further down in the part below the beard;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping back a little; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another on the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly, as if smelling.
And some ancient ones said that some men use a cautery made like a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess; and the pain leapt out, as we said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work there is fear where the patient now dies, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse from what we have said about the divisions of treatments, and it does no good, then there are three kinds of cautery, all of which are good.
Of which one way is that you make three cauteries, or four, by drawing lines along the length of the mouse, according to the shape of the liver cautery we spoke of before;
and do not press your hand too hard with the whole cautery, and let the patient be often on his back;
And another way of cautery is that you heat the cautery that has two nerves, as we showed in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and raise the heart that is over the mouse, or the patient's elbow comes towards the left, and let the elevation you raise the heart be along the heart, according to the length of the body, and the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards, put the two inflamed nerves so that the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the whole cautery to three nerves.
After the cure, when it has cast off corruption for a long time, and this is worth more than the other cures previously mentioned.
Cautery is not useful for dropsy, except in the manner called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment is of no benefit, then you must make four cauteries around the hip, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back on the spine, and one on the breast. And let the cauteries be close to the thick part of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not abandon the patient's treatment after the cautery. And healing would be hastened, and both intentions will be combined with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the shape we have previously shown. And that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what has been set forth previously.
When the feet are swollen in someone who is hydrops, and are full of yellow water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the ring finger and little finger. and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the yellow water burst forth, and let the cauteries be according to this shape.
After that, make two cauteries on each leg at the point of the little finger. and let the cauteries be long, one beneath the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treating, that the water may flow out;
after the treatment of the other cures that we have mentioned.
When the looseness of the belly comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive virtue which is in the stomach and in the intestine is weakened, and cannot be cured by any method of treatment; and you see the patient suffering greatly and with strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach, according to what he has previously discussed on the cautery of the stomach, with a circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the belly, with a single small cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the navel, and one cautery on each kidney, and two small cauteries on the stomach next to the large one, for the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance.
of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, moist, corrupted humors, and have been treated as we have said in divisions, and it does not help at all, then make cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those that are entirely outside the small of the back little by little in a triangular fashion, and one cautery under the belly two inches.
And if you think that the stomach is cold, and the food does not cook, and you see the face swelling, then on the face put one large cautery on the stomach, as it has been said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the whole cautery in a row. And leave the cautery open a long time. After the treatment, leave the place until it is healed.
When you cut the thelulus, heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and then place it, all ablaze, upon the cut thelulus; and leave it there so long that the cautery reaches the vein's origin, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much thelulus, cauterize each one as we have said; after applying beneficial ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery over the alchatim, it will have greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate cutting or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness comes that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula occurs, and it is old and throws out corrupted pus and moisture, you should probe it with a very thin probe, and ensure that you know how deep the probe goes.
Then heat the cautery, which resembles a scraper, and place it in the fistula according to the depth the probe has entered, and repeat the cautery until the putrid and corrupted flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, depending on its need.
And be careful not to burn the surrounding nerves and large veins.
If the fistula goes to the bladder and the intestines, avoid those areas, and only apply the cautery to the fleshy parts, and be aware that it is not penetrating.
Afterwards, treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed.
And if the matter has not been removed, know that the area is infected, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted. And just as one of those that we will describe in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from great flatulence, and does not take the form of a woman's ailment, then it is necessary that you make cautery on the kidneys on one side and the other with the clavile cautery that we have previously described;
And if we cauterize it in the middle, then there will be three cauteries in a line, and will provide greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is weak and flabby from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize on the outer part of the bladder, where the hair of the little finger begins, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the nail of a finger;
and make one cautery on the back outside, or two if you need it;
and let the cauteries be shallow according to the form previously stated.
When the spleen is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the flowers are corrupted and their endings are delayed; and when they come, there is great pain. Then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the belly, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back.
And let the cauteries be sharp, as we have said.
When viscous moisture descends to the socket of the hip, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
And if the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip socket with one cautery shaped like a circle, and mark in front of the area around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is inside the circle;
And let the cautery be such as that with which one cauterized the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, then make three cauteries of large olive wood, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the cords;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain in the hip When pain comes in the socket of the hip, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not working, and the illness is long-standing: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of the large humors with foul-smelling pills, or other good-smelling pills of similar kind. After that, apply cautery;
and the method of cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, burning medicines together, and cautery by fire.
Cautery by fire is according to many methods, of which one is such:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this shape, and make them deep and large, and have between each cautery the thickness of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, for which there are four according to this shape:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip;
but make it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the thick parts of the joint are burned.
And this is the way it is done in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip, and does not reach the thigh nor the leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and the leg, then make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, a little to the left;
and let the cauteries be incisional, and let the thickened parts of the joint be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or near the heel, cauterize where he feels the pain three or four times with the cautery that is called "points". And if necessary, then make more.
And if it is known that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a cautery with an incisional or circular cautery, and be very careful in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and major arteries, and that you do not cause the patient further harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen several who made cauteries on the ankle of the foot, and they left it so long that the leg was all swollen, and the foot also, and the entire foot was pierced and corrupted. After a solution of the belly, from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make cauteries on one and the other, according to this manner.
And the wise said regarding the cautery of the hip, that this is the manner: make one such iron, and let it be at the head as thick as a fingertip, or a little less, and let it be with notches, and let it be from one notch to the other of the space the quantity of a fingertip;
and let the notches be opposite from two sides, and let them also be like knots, and let there be one iron handle well made;
and this is the shape:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then it is placed on the sore hip, and it should be turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize it once, cauterize again, and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; after the treatment of ointment until it is healed.
Albucasim says that we use this cautery little because of the fear of its effect, and we see few who use it;
and nevertheless, it is a good cautery for those who can tolerate it, and in the places where it is appropriate.
The burning medical cautery is made by creating an instrument with grooves into which the edges of the wound descend, and it should be made of bronze or iron with a long side, and with two notches, and each notch should be the thickness of a finger. and they should be open at the front and the top, and join together according to this shape:
Then place the wound on the patient's healthy side, lying on their sound side, and press your hand firmly onto the wound. Then pour between the two circles of hot water, which has been heated slightly, and leave it for an hour, and the patient endures the heat and burning.
For it produces a burn like fire.
And when the burn has subsided, remove your hand with the instrument and apply a poultice of soft water, and leave it for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the burn is removed; and leave it for three days so that the rot comes out.
and that would be the final aid after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has spread to the thigh or leg, you should make an instrument that soaks in water according to what you have done to the hip likewise;
and this is the method of hot water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where it has a small hole to allow the point of a razor to enter;
where it has a small hole to allow the point of a razor to enter; and place over that pot another pot well sealed, and put alkali and lime and fresh water on top, until there is a two fingers' breadth of it above the powders when you have well grasped it in your hand;
and leave it thus until water drains off and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very sharp and is administered in various medical treatments and for cauterization of other limbs.
For it works like fire, and there are other medicines used for cauterizing the hip, such as turpentine and honey and mastic and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a treatment that cured a man of hip and sciatic pain, and praises it highly, saying that no other treatment was needed, and that he was healed completely the first time this treatment was done, and he was bathed as he will teach next.
And says in this way that you should take fresh and dry green litharge and grind it well with a little fat, and put it on the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bind it on.
and leave it on for three hours, and for the amount of time that the patient no longer feels the burning sensation.
And then put him into a bath until his body is slightly wet, and put him in bed, and the pain will depart and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery or such medicines unless after the evacuation of bodily humours.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it helps greatly.
and the cauteries should be done in this manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it over the hollow that is between the big toe and the other toe, which is called the foscile.
Then take dry goat's dung, and hold it in fire until it is embers, and place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
and do so again, and do not cease to do so until you think by your senses that it has reached the hip, and that the pain has stopped;
and this manner of cautery is called "cautery of goat.
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether through falling or impact or through excessive evacuation, or by the appearance of spread cold matter, in none of these cases is cautery of use, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary, after the patient has been emptied of fetid pills or other similar things, that three lines of incision be made on the back, where the pain lies, and on each line five cauteries, or more, according to the strength and the quantity that the patient can endure;
and let the cauteries be made according to the cautery that is called "points";
and if you wish, make three or four cauteries at the middle clavil cautery according to this form:
Often this illness comes to young children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have a tight chest when they rise, and fear; and you find on the lower spine of the back, and on those parts that appear on the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery touches each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a cautery that pricks two or three lines, and let the pricks be close together.
After curing the area until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not administer cautery to a swelling that is in a nerve's space.
Of the pain of the joints
When pains of the joints are caused by moistures that spread throughout the body's limbs, and when pain comes to the feet, which those learned call "podagra" properly, and when it is caused by cold and the cures of medicines cannot heal it, it is cured by cauteries in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it needs to be pricked on the face of the foot, make a cautery on the entire cautery called "point". And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, make three or four cauteries on each knee, of each part, of a cautery that is olive-shaped;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand on it any longer than is necessary for the depth of the heart to be burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and back, administer the cautery that we have described in this chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make pricks around the wrist two lines;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, make pricks on each joint and on the skin of the hand;
and if the pains come to the elbows or shoulders, cauterize each part, and provide good care to the patient and give them medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge the phlegm, he will be healthy with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the boil descends to the testicles and it is recent, then when you wish to treat it, do not let him eat that day. and let him use things that loosen the belly, so that the waste descends from his belly;
Afterwards, make him sit on his back between your hands, and tell him to hold his breath until the boils are healed, and move them with your fingers, and draw a sign under the rupture on the bone of the groin, and make a mark that resembles half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:
until it is white and throws sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and the attendant holds his hand over them so that they do not return;
and properly open the patient's thighs, and place a cushion beneath him and an attendant on his thighs, and another on his chest who holds his hands;
then place the cautery on the sign with your whole hand, hold it straight, and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, begin it again another time until you come to the bone; and carefully guard that the bowel does not jump when you apply the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that by this the patient does not die, or other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And it is necessary that the cauteries for children be subtle according to their size, and for large people as large according to their size;
after three days treat the area of the cautery with butter until the burn is removed;
after that treat with other ointments until it is healed, and the patient lies on their back for 40 days until the wound is properly healed;
and it is necessary that his nourishments be lessened for a long time, so that the boils do not appear when he tries to move about in rooms.
And after 40 days, when he wants to get up, give him a well-made bandage, and keep it on for 40 more days;
and let him have good rest, let him work little and beware of too much drink and food, and of too much noise;
and when he follows this instruction, he is completely healed.
And I will say next the treatment of cutting in this chapter.
When ruptures occur in other parts of the belly and are known, and you see that they are not growing any further, then apply a cauterizing cautery to them, proportionate to their size, and let the third of the core be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients said that it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery according to this shape:
but first mark the spot and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another one outside, and then place your hand in the middle, covering the entire cautery with your hand.
But the first cauteries are lighter and milder.
of ancient pain in any limb When pain comes to any limb, from falling or striking, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is not effective, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points", and the cauterization should be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and weakness and its virtue and the location of the twisting and pain.
If it is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, start another cautery on that one, for it is customary that it should change to the limb nearest to it, therefore it is necessary that you perform cauteries until the patient is healed.
Blisters are sometimes aided by cautery, greatly helping, and especially those illnesses that come from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it to be cauterized, watch if the illness is in its beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend nor remain, and you doubt that the corruption will not seize the entire patient, then give it five cauteries on the head: One in the middle of the head, and the other towards the forehead at the end of the hair; and two on the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and hold your hand there until the cauteries reach the bone, and until the blisters come out so that the vapors of the thick humors may escape;
and cauterize it on the affected area as described before.
And if the inflammation is widespread; and if it visibly spreads, you must cauterize it with the cauteries as described for the head, one cautery on the bridge of the nose, two cauteries on the spine of the neck, six cauteries on the spine of the back, one large one on the hip and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the chest, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves behind the buttock, that you not burn them;
and sometimes one cauterizes on the bone of the knee, and one on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give him, and the more benefit;
And know that the sick person does not feel any pain at the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you find in the forms of irons.
After the treatment, apply flour of vetch with honey and other remedies until it is healthy.
When swelling comes to any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not yet healed, then apply cauteries to the limb according to its size and smallness;
and let the cauteries be a little bit into the thickness of the flesh; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes cauteries are applied to the hand and foot and back, at the point of the nerve that paralyzes the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and however, no one should intervene if they do not know the members and the points of the nerves moving the body.
When the illness called "albaras" is advanced, and the tools of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the thickness of the core, until the whiteness is gone and its color is changed;
then cure it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and blood of a colon and blood of an almond, a portion of each; and mix all together, and bind it with a cloth, and apply to the spot until it is healed.
The cure of a sore by cautery
When a sore appears at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the sore.
And nevertheless, the wise say that one should also cauterize the middle of the sore;
and nevertheless, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it might become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen this happen several times;
and a more appropriate thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery called "circle," as we have said in many treatments concerning cauteries.
When someone has a disease called "adubelati," and it is slow to heal, either because of the excess it causes or because of the age of the patient if they are decrepit (that is, too old) and have little blood, or because of the time; and you should try to hasten its healing: then cauterize it around with many small cauteries by pricking; after that, leave it thus. For it will hasten to heal.
And if you wish to pierce it with a full cautery, heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And place your hand in the middle of that ailment called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it outside in such a manner that the course of the rot is relieved.
After that, treat it until it is completely healed.
There is another kind of ailment, called "corrodens," which is nothing more than a consumption of a limb, for it consumes the limbs just as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see this ailment in a place that can endure cautery with fire, then heat the cauteries, small and large, according to what is appropriate for the place where the ailment is.
After cauterizing it from all sides until you have eradicated all corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupt is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized areas soft compresses with oil until the heat from the fire is gone, and all the corruption.
After the treatment with ointments that generate flesh.
And if after three days you see that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good.
and if not, then repeat the cautery on those parts that remain corrupted.
And this ailment is sometimes cured with acute medicine instead of cautery by fire;
however, cautery by fire is of greater help, and I have already discussed the cure with acute medicine in the division: take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come to the feet Often it happens that on the feet, from outside, a sickness arises that is called "clos" according to our understanding, and is a large, encased thing that hurts the foot.
And the cauteries for this sickness are according to two manners. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery, shaped like a roof tile, made of good iron to a size that it can grasp the spot on all sides, and that it has fine edges;
after that, you put it very hot on the spot, and turn your hand all around the spot until it reaches the bottom of the spot; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus; then make a poultice of wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the spot will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the place with ointment, healing the wound until it is healed.
And if they are inflamed on the body, and this happens often on the hands and feet, you must apply hot water cautery to it; and is of such a manner: take a rod of bronze or iron, or a piece of lead, and place on the spot and the nail, which is to say for warts; and place the rod so that it encompasses the entire area, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand by turning so that the edge of the rod reaches the root of the nail, and can find a path for the hot water deep down to the root;
and let the patient endure a little the scorching of the hot water for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will detach itself from all its roots.
Do so one after another, until you have removed all those that are on the body, then cure them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from cold nerves, or from a quartan fever or other, you should apply four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach using olive oil cautery;
This will stop the trembling, and the patient will recover from the cold illness quickly.
Sometimes foul-smelling pustules appear on the body, caused by corrupted matter.
If they appear, a cautery should be applied to each head of the pustule first. A subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose point is heated in a fire, or of long aristolochia root, or a lens-shaped cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow any further, but the excess from which they come is broken, and they are healed.
But it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times there are large bleedings from the artery that is cut at the wound that comes to the outside, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and to similar things; and it is a very grievous thing to stop.
And yet when this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger over the wound of the vein, and press firmly until the blood is still beneath your finger, and no more drops issue;
then put the olive cauteries, several small and large, in the fire until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery upon that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stanched.
And if it spurts out forcefully when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery goes out, quickly take another cautery from those in the fire.
And do not cease doing this, one after the other, until the blood is stanched;
and be careful that you do not burn the nerve nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from an artery, it cannot be well stanched, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four methods that we have said: or by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by a tight binding of thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stanch blood; and be bound and tightened at the beginning.
Whoever applies a stanching by tying tightly with cloths or putting burning things on it, or other similar things, will not profit much.
And if this happens to someone and they do not have a mirror or medicine present, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein, as we have said, and extend it well until it is stanched above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but moisten it with cold water often, that it may be very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stanched;
and do the inquiries beforehand of those who need cauteries and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter all the illnesses in which fire cautery, or burning medicine, is necessary, and the origins and causes and instruments and forms of cauteries;
and have arranged that chapter from head to foot, and I shall follow the same path in this chapter so that one can find more readily what one desires.
And before I begin this, dear son, you must understand that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first on cauteries, and therefore it requires greater caution.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you not to undertake folly. For many kinds of people come to treatments. So come those who are so angered by their illness that they die easily because of the frenzy they find in their illness, and from the greatness of its malice; And of these one must have fear.
And of these there are some who give you their understanding, and say: wait, I am cured"; and the illness is spiteful.
You should not agree with those who come to you with this manner, but place greater value on your honor than on your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely concerning those of whom you are certain, and of whom you can have taken and praise.
and use prognosis and indication in the treatment of your sick, so that health may be brought about;
and this will help you acquire good reputation, glory, and lasting memory.
Dear son, may our Lord grant you good understanding and uprightness, and if you wish to hope for the holy inspiration of his hand, amen.
Now I have arranged this chapter, by dividing it into chapters, according to what is before it, the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may find more easily what you will need.
Know that this illness often comes to children during childbirth, and when the midwife holds the child's head too tightly;
and sometimes it comes from a cause unknown.
And I never saw this illness in anyone but children, and in all those I saw, death was hastened. And therefore it seems to me that it is better to leave this kind of treatment.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger each day until he could no longer support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone on the surface, between the heart and the bone;
and the treatment is such if the moisture is between the heart and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you must make a wide opening in the head;
and it should be as long as two fingers, until the moisture runs;
and see here the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is deeper, and the abscess larger, make two openings in the shape of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs show the head's edges open on each side, and the pus leaps out when you press your hand inside, and this has not been resolved: then you should cut three openings through the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, remove all the moisture outwards. Afterwards, bind the openings with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil on them, and leave it thus until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with bandages and ointments, and let the head heal evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another way of incision is that you observe where the abscess is large, and the gathering of the water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes to the right; and sometimes to the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess appears, and the filling of water, and cut it according to what you have the power to do;
and beware that you do not cut the artery; and if blood flows, so that the patient dies from the outflow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When a disease called "catarrh" occurs in someone's eyes or chest, and the illness is long-standing, and the medical treatment is of no benefit, then the final treatment is cautery, with which they will cut the two arteries.
It is necessary then, when you are about to cut them, that the patient hold their head back; afterwards, he rubs the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens their neck with all their strength; then look where the veins are exposed, and the locations of both are near the ears, and they are soon cut;
then mark the spots, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula from two sides, so that the incision reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you want, place the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting likewise as you should through it.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously outward.
And if the artery is not apparent to feel, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark the spot and cut down to the bone;
and the blood that must be drawn out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can endure, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if there remains on the bone a piece of the scab, cut it so that no hot abscesses form, then bind the wound and apply ointments until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine comes, and acute catarrh, because of moisture in the tears and heat in the temples and old madness and similar things, and he is treated with various medical cures and none of this helps him, we will drain the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient should pull back the hair on his temples, and locate the artery that appears in the temple, for it is clearly seen by its pulsation, and is scarcely visible in some people who are too cold;
and if it is visible, the patient should compress its neck with some cloths, then rub the area with a rough cloth, and warm the area with hot water until the artery is clearly visible; then take the spatule, of which this is the form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it upwards with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, then turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it at that point according to the amount of the two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood will not flow completely.
And draw the blood from six ounces to three;
and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no putrefaction comes before the healing of the wound, and there is a flow of blood;
then cut the excess that is between the two ties at the same time, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery to the bone until the heads are cut;
and that is the best work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cauterization is a help to finish the moistures: Therefore, it is of greater help for moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and place well-made tents on top;
and when one removes them, let them be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until they are healed;
and if blood flows from the artery while you are working on it, quickly stop it by cautery, or fill the space with vitriol and hold it with your hand until the blood is stopped; and if you do not have this present, put your finger over the place until the blood is congealed, and cool the place with cold water until the blood stops, and hold it as is necessary;
And there should be one finger's breadth of space between the two blades, and then, when you have marked the two places, you place the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and let them be separated between the two sides, for it is not entirely fused by this cautery.
and this is the form of the cautery:
And the milder and more expedient in extracting the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cutting cautery from two sides, but the cutting parts should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds less heat.
of tears When the tears from the eyes are descending into the veins that are on the top of the head and there is no benefit from any medicine applied, and you see the patient's forehead reddening, and feel trembling or a tremor on the forehead; and if the skin is thin and moist so that the hair from the temples has fallen out, and the temples are heated and scorched by the heat of the tears, then this treatment is needed. And the ancients called it "contused cure", and it is that you do to the patient who has this ailment, the hair that they have on their forehead, and then make three equal lengthwise cuts on their forehead;
And the ancients called it "contused cure", and it is that you do to the patient who has this ailment, the hair that they have on their forehead, and then make three equal lengthwise cuts on their forehead; and one of the cuts should be as if two go right through the forehead downwards to the nose, and the other two are along the temples, above the skin, and be careful not to cut any arteries that are along the temples.
and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and each wound should be the size of three fingers in length.
and have prepared a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe away the blood, then apply the pointed spatula from two sides, as follows:
from the incision that is by the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two cuts over all the surface that is above the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then remove this spatula. then place in the first cut the instrument called "cultellaire", which is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is blunt, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And place the cutting side towards the flesh near the heart, and the blunt side towards the bone, and insert it until it reaches the middle cut.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to what appears from the heart, and then do the same in the middle cut to the other end.
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the spot for the drawn blood.
Then place a tent of old cotton in each cut, and put over cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard against pus-filled boils.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and apply a plentiful poultice of warm water, then treat with basil ointment with rose oil, and other remedies used for healing wounds, until it is healed.
When some suffer acute colds, and you see the eyes inflamed and small, and the sight weakened, and the eyelids burned. and the hair falls out, and there is sharp pain deep in the head, and the patient sneezes; Then know by these symptoms that these matters and this cold originate from many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And you instruct the patient to lie on their back, then make a large incision in the middle of their forehead, and another one a little wider. And begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone. and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when eating.
and when the bone is exposed, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, then separate the two edges of the incision and put old cotton and linen strips in between. then tie over it cloths soaked in wine and oil, and be careful of a hot abscess.
When it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it, then treat it with things that dry up and cause flesh to grow.
In such a manner: take two parts of flour of wheat, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster. and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow over everything.
of the stopping up of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of the four things: or grains, or beasts, or a mine stone, or similar things like iron; or seeds, such as peas, beans, lentils; or flowing things such as water and pus and similar things.
When a stone or other thing that does not adhere to the ear, nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, place the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then distill a little violet oil or oil of sesamum, then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with a concoction, and stop his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upwards.
Often comes relief through this treatment;
and if it does not come relief, then administer extraction with fine tweezers, of which here is the form:
If it relieves with the tweezers, that is good;
if not, then administer extraction with a fine, small double-edged hook;
and if it does not relieve by this, make a bronze chain and push the chain's head into the ear canal firmly, and seal what is around the chain with softened wax so that wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out strongly, for many times it relieves as we have said;
and if it does not relieve in this manner, take glue with which birds are caught, and place on it any instrument fit to do this, and place a bit of cotton around it; then press the glue against the stone or whatever, and pull out.
And if it does not relieve by all these things that we have said, hasten to lance the ear lest a hot abscess arise and spasm;
and the manner of the lancing is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to the measure of its power, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, at the fat or dependent place; and let the incision be like a crescent, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and suck it quickly into your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is grains that are within and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin, subtle spatula according to this form: and administer an incision to that grain.
But do not do this at all when you think the grain is moist due to the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract with delicate tweezers and by suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is made easier.
In the water that falls into the ear, the patient must first use a sneezing remedy, and then stuff the ear with old cotton. And let him lie down on the same ear where the water is. If it jumps out by this, it is good.
If not, then take many small, light stones the length of your finger, and warm them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and lift himself up on his feet on the other side, and place another stone on the stone in the ear; and do not cease to place stone on stone until the water comes out completely, and thus it jumps out completely;
and if you wish, take a twig, and put one end in the ear, and hold the other end over fire until the furthest end of the twig is burned;
then repeat with other twigs until the water comes out completely, just as we said with the stones.
In extracting a creature, if it is small, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, administer extraction with tweezers; and that is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In extracting worms lodged in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment is of no use, then you must look at the ear in the sun: if any worms are visible, extract them with fine tweezers, and if none are visible, take the implement whose shape is like this:
And it should be narrow underneath and wide above. And insert the finest end into the ear according to the severity of the patient's suffering, then gently suck the entire implement; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they don't come out, plug around the implement with cotton as I have described for the stone;
and if they don't jump out as we have said, administer distillations that the ancients have proven effective for killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distil your oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which the form is as you see: And it is of silver or bronze, narrow beneath with small holes, and above, open to distill;
and to press the distillation with an instrument of well-made bronze for this purpose, and if you wish, take a scraper and wrap cotton around its pointed end; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever medicine you wish into the canal, and the canal should be in the ear;
then place the scraper with the cotton inside, and press your hand gently until the oil is distilled to the end of the ear; and the patient smells it within, and let the distillation be a little heated over a fire as one distills it into the ear; and watch that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be so good.
Of the stopping of the ears
No children are born without any holes in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men by stopping of wounds, or of flesh growing inside the ear, and these stoppings sometimes go deep into the ear, so one cannot see them;
and sometimes it comes a little away from the hole, and one sees it well.
That which goes deep, so that one cannot see it, is of difficult healing in many cases, and in that which one sees, you must place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction apparent, if you open all this blockage, of which this is the form:
And be sharp and cutting in front and behind, all smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
If the obstruction is of flesh born or a growth on the ear, then hold it with fine forceps, and cut it gently, until all that flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a fine, light scraper and warm it slightly in the fire, then place it on the growth in the ear.
If you sense the obstruction causing the patient to experience pain when hearing, pierce gently, and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear;
Then place a tent in the ear, according to the width of the opening, and soak it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and soak it in rose water, and dust it with powdered crushed vitriol;
And if you see the ear swollen, it is necessary to remove the tent and apply another tent soaked in cerote, made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, dip a sponge and cloths in cold water, and apply it to the ear, and use other treatments that stop the blood discharge, which are in the treatment of distillations.
This ailment that comes as papillomas on the eyes when they are moist and dry, it is necessary that you remove them with tweezers and pliers, and cut it with a spatula from its roots; then put powdered vitriol on the area.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a subtle lentil-shaped cautery, and the cauterization after the incision is beneficial;
and many times they return, when anything remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of hail Many times there come to the eyes in papers things that seem like hail in its form and hardness, and for this reason this illness is called "grandine," and it is a collection of thick moisture in the paper above and below; the work is such:
the work is such: watch if the grandine moves from one side to the other, and it is an easy thing to know;
then cut it open from the wide part, then lightly scrape each part, then take it with pincers and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the paper a little, do not harm the patient;
and if the fissure is large, assemble it with stitches, and cure it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not exert any force, for the ointment will soon restore it and generate flesh.
And if the hard object is descending into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, invert the paper, and extract the hard object with pincers, and cut it and press it from one side and the other;
and if the paper is loosened by the incision, this does no harm;
and when the hard object is cut, wash the wound with salt water, and cure the area with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the grease of the eyes Exinach is a grease that is generated in the tissues of the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to adults, and it hurts their eyes greatly, and they get colds in the mornings, and cannot look at the sun's light because tears flood their eyes;
and therefore they lie on their faces often, and sleep on their backs, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, that swelling and the appearance have covered with the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the method of the treatment is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the quantity of exinach in each part, then put it over it; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered within the circle;
then cut a slit in the middle of the moisture, with a sharp spatula, a slit no wider than the incision made in vein bleeding;
and cut the skin deep until you reach the exinach; and in several places exinach comes from the slit, according to the shape of a piece of white fat.
Then pull it out completely with a piece of cloth held between your fingers, turning your hand to the right and left until it is spread out;
and be careful not to push into the slit, that you do not reach the entire spatula up to the eye, that you do not injure it.
And if the exirnach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, then slightly increase the slit a little until it appears;
then pull it out as we have said, then moisten cloths in oil and water, and put on the place, and bind with bandages.
And some men grind stones and apply them to corrupt the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess occurs at the place, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the parts. When extra hairs grow on parts beyond the natural ones, and become aged, they harm the eyes and cause various ailments, such as habitual tears and softening of the parts and the albuginea, so much that it is a cause of the destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four ways: or by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is before or in the chapter on cautery, and is done either by incision and stitching or by cauterizing, according to what I will say.
You must place the patient's head on your chest, then turn the eyelid to your left hand;
if it is turned, it is good; if not, then put a needle all along the thread above it; and let it be next to the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and pull the thread above the entire eyelid, and turn it with a razor;
then cut into the part beneath the eyelid, beneath the adhering hairs, cutting all the way across, from the large tear duct to the small one;
then remove the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and linen beneath the eyelid, then apply a figure of a bandage to the eyelid, like a myrtle leaf, and however it is necessary that the shape be according to the amount you wish to raise the eyelid that is divided into all parts.
And if there is a need to cut a large amount of the eyelid, according to how soft the eyelid is;
then cut across the entire space above the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs, the thickness of a root, then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape it all away;
then stitch the two edges together with a fine wool thread using a needle, wipe away the blood, and dry the excess threads above the two eyebrows with some kind of glue, if you wish to do so;
and if not, do not treat it, then leave the stitches and threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitches, with dry and constricting things, for paper aids in the healing of the wound and its joining, but stitches are gentler (as the ancients said), and this is a work without fear; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and it is that you shape the paper in a form similar to a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three separated points according to the shape shown here:
then cut what protrudes with small equal forces according to the shape shown here:
And if you lack the power to hold the tongs, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread, and insert it into the figure; and insert another thread next to the large tear, and the second thread next to the small one, and hold the threads evenly between your fingers;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift the entire skin on which you have drawn, as we have described, then bring the two edges of the wound together with stitches, and cure it until it is healed;
and if an abscess arises at your incision, then soothe it with cerote and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the papillary area are converted:
so you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more artificial.
The treatment of the canes is according to this form: and it is that you convert the papillary area and the fissure within according to what I said, and then make two canes by art, and two thin ligaments as long as the papillary area and the width of the spatulate is; and cut as two heads from two parts where you hold the threads;
then assemble one and the other subtly over what rises from the papillary area of the eye, and hold the two canes from the two parts together; and leave it thus for a few days, and the skin that will be held tight will die and heal and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it lingers, then cut it with some force, then treat it until it is healthy;
and when the wound is closed, and the papillary area is lifted, and the hair will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
The work is such that you take a fine needle, and put a fine and soft silk thread in it; Then assemble the ends and tie them together subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
Then arrange another fine silk thread briefly in the chase, and tie the ends of the thread;
Then place the patient's head on your chest;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and small work, then put the needle with all the chase into the root of the hair close by, and pierce it into the skin quickly until you pull it over the natural hair;
Then pull out the hair until it is over the chase, and place the hair into the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
Then withdraw your hand so that the hairs come out of the entire chase into the skin with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, you will pull the chase underneath along all the thread that you have arranged, until the chase comes out of the hole above and you see it with your vision of the eye;
Then you will pull the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair hardens in its place and the flesh grows over;
And if the hair is small, you will attach one long hair from the natural hair, and let it be raised with that or you will leave it, until it is lengthened, and then lift it.
Of the corruption of the eye When this disease, which is called "aleacrati" or corruption, comes to the eye, there are two kinds of it:
One natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through the injury of a wound, or from cutting or cautery, and similar things.
And the manner of treatment is that you split that weld, and separate its edges, and put linen strips inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict. For if you do that, the illness will return worse than the first;
but use remedies that soften, like fenugreek; and irrigate with water or cooked linseed, and ointments of diaquilon melted into some oil, and wrap a bandage in it, and treat it with this.
And the success of your treatment depends on you taking care that it does not heal according to its previous form;
and these treatments we have described are only remedies for this illness, to prevent it from returning in the same way as before.
This disease that is below, which is truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental.
The accidental causes come from wounds and cuts and cauteries and similar things;
And the method of treatment is that you take a needle, on which there is a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and pierce it from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out at two points in the flesh;
Then stretch the flesh over the entire needle, and cut it with a wide spatula. And if the paper's shape returns as required, it is good;
If not, take a scraper and place it in the fissure, and turn the paper, and make two cuts on the inside edge of the paper;
and let the ends of the two cuts be at the two corners of the incision you have made, and form angles so that when they are assembled, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "I Greek";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its edges are sharp beneath, from what is underneath the paper, then join the two separated parts and sew them with a woolen thread;
then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if the ailment comes from a fissure, or a stitch, or a cautery, then you must make a clean cut beneath the hairs on the papers, according to what is stated previously; then separate between the two lips of a poultice, as I have said;
then separate between the two lips of a poultice, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the ailment, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise masters prepare remedies with all their power so that they may return the form to its natural shape;
and the patient himself, according to what work and instruments are required in various situations.
When this union happens to people in such a way that the paper on top is glued to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the tip of a razor under the paper and lift it up;
and extend it with pincers, until you cut what is stuck to the subtle spatula, which must not be too sharp nor too sharp, so that the patient cannot endure that the too sharp spatula wounds the eye;
and let your incision, with which you scrape that assembly, be slight, so that the paper returns to its natural shape;
and the entire assembly is healed, and sometimes they use salty water in the eye, and wash it with fresh water and with a poultice;
then place a linen tent between the paper and the eye, and put soaked wool on top of the eye, soaked in abundance of egg white; and after three days use poultices and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two manners: It is nervous and resembling hard skin, and another which is not nervous, but is like frozen white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and tries to crush it with pincers, one cannot.
And both forms begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight, and all the light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient should put his head in your lap, then you open his eyes; and lift the paper with your hand, then grasp the nail with small, double-edged pincers, and extend it upward; Then take a needle, and put a horse hair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and insert it into the nail, and pierce it all the way through with the needle, and tie the nail with a thread and extend it upward, and scrape all the hair from the nail side that touches the eyelid and the silk to the hair to the top, then cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a very fine and small force, and leave the natural tissue of the tear duct, so that the flow of tears does not come from the incision.
and sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, and with a thread, as we have said; then one scrapes it with a very soft scraper, whose form is this:
And be careful that the scraper does not touch the fleshy tissue and break it, and that the eyelid is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little bit of boiled salt and lead colic into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nerve-ridden, and you cannot insert the needle, and the lancet cannot enter, often this kind of nail is cured with medicines;
and grow as I have described in the division, and if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take the scraper, a little sharp according to this form: And carefully scrape the nail, and if you see that it is thinning and the flesh is approaching, then distill from your mouth into the eye colic made of lead and red colic and boiled salt, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing else opposes you in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first cure the hot abscess until it is healed, then recommence the work as before, until it is healed.
then begin the other work again, according to this same process, until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the tear duct's flesh harms the eye greatly, then suspend it on the hook, and cut off a part of it, and not all of it, so that the flow of tears does not come out;
then distill red colic, which is made of lead, into the eye.
Sometimes red flesh grows in the eyes of some men, and covers the pupil and presses on the eyelids and turns to a scab, and appears like a rose-colored bead.
and the treatment is that the patient places their head in your lap, then opens their eyes, and draws all that flesh to suitable hooks, and holds it in place by force.
then cut away the first layer of flesh, and continue cutting with a razor to the end, and be careful not to damage the eye in the process.
and the incision should be like the incision of the toenail, which we have discussed, using small forces with which to remove the scab, as the method after this chapter demonstrates.
And when the incision is complete and all the flesh is removed, apply to the eye a mixture of ground herbs or you can distill red ochre and similar corrosive medicines, and place a protective coating of cotton over the eye with a bandage of egg white, so that it is secure against a heated abscess.
And if anything remains, and the blood flows over you, and you suspect a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess.
Then return to your work until it is healed, and do likewise for all wounds where the flesh is joined together in this manner.
However, you must always lighten the treatment for every eye that is weak in its natural way. and from the accidental way, in the work of iron.
And do not put your hand on any of these works until you see that this member is enduring that work.
Red veins are those that are covered over the eye, and they take away the eye's work and weaken the eye every day.
It is necessary therefore, first, that you look to see if the eye, in which the redness is, is strong, and there is no other illness besides the redness. Then treat it in this manner:
Tell the patient to place his head against your chest, then carefully draw those veins out of the wound according to your expertise, and let the forceps be thin and double, according to this form:
And let there be two forceps in a row in one piece, according to this form:
Then, with the forceps, carefully remove those veins, and wipe away the blood one hour after another, until you see those veins pulled clear of the eye;
And be careful not to pierce the eye with the points of the forceps, and do this work at midday in front of the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you cut only the veins;
And when you have done this, instill into the eye green and red concoction to dissolve what remains of the infection.
And if you cannot remove all of it at that time, apply a plaster to the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for several days until the pain is relieved and a hot abscess is certain, then begin again in this manner that is before until it is healed;
And this is the form of the forceps:
The mirror is called "arissati" fistula:
When you treat it with cautery and with burning sharp medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, there is a trick in it that you must cut open the abscess, where it should remain, and remove all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and the blackness, then you must remove it with all the instruments of which this is the form;
and it is called "aspre chief," and it should be made of iron, with a point on one end, and it should be pointed like a file, as it is in the present form:
And place it on the spot of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
if the place is healed, and flesh grows, and the body of the wound is healed, and remains so for 40 days, and it does not renew or is not suppurating, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other remedy than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nose according to this form: and that you expose the bone a second time with an iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is exposed, you take a drill according to this form, and let the iron head be three-angled, and the shaft be tapered to the tip as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the entire drill until it pierces the bone, and the patient feels it because air comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nose; so it is a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open, and there is no disturbance to the nose, nor any decrease, then you must bandage the patient;
then treat it, then put leeches or cupping glasses on it without striking to suck, then apply to the eye a compress made of acacia, aloe, frankincense and gum tragacanth, and then hold the eye tight, and put the plaster over it with bandages and strips;
and the way of the strips is that you take strips soft enough, and double each in four, and then place one over the other according to the amount that the eye needs;
then hold it tight over a hard bandage, and repeat the cupping to suck without striking;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye tightly bound day and night, and if the compress softens, then you must hold it tight;
then remove the compress after a day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, that is good;
if not; then repeat the poultice, bandages, compress, and cupping until healed.
from the tearing of cloth or linen When tearing occurs in the cloth or linen, then it appears and comes forth from the threads like grains of resin, and is frightening to see;
Then, if you see it torn, the work is such that you insert a needle into the root of the part underneath until the top, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and pierce it, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the cloth around it, and tighten it well, then remove the needle and put on oiled wool soaked in abundant egg white;
and leave it until the thread comes out with the cloth, then treat the wound with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is constricted by the cloth in a circle on every side, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great appearance, pierce it with a fine spatula that goes deep into the eye, and drain the white moisture and lower the eye, and immediately insert it back in;
then treat it until it is healed.
This disease, called "alcunnati," is nothing but swelling accumulated in the eye, resembling a descending spike, but it is not a spike;
and the way to do this is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on both sides, and move it so that you see the swelling come up towards your eyes; then it will be fixed, and it will not descend, and the light will be cleared, and the patient will see things as he used to;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is a spike, and if the descent of the swelling is not as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take the fine spatula and cut on the cornea a little bit along the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the crown, until the swelling comes out;
and when it has come out, then instill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water or fenugreek boiled and honey, then be treated with further treatment until it is healed.
of the waters of the eye We have already the appearances of the waters in the division, and what is necessary to pierce; then work according to the health.
You must make the sick person sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye tightly.
then place the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument that is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the tip of the instrument beside the crown, by the thickness of a hair, on that white part of the eye near the smaller tear duct, then firmly push the instrument called "almagda" and rotate your hand until it pierces the white part of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and it is necessary that the measurement of the almagda's path be at the depth of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the crown of the eye;
if you will see the bone in that membrane, due to the clarity of the cornea, and then place the instrument to the place where the point is, then press it along one path after another.
if the point descends now, the patient will see before him and the instrument in his eye.
After a small rest, and if the point ascends the second path, apply force with the instrument, and when it is firmly fixed and it does not rise, then extract the almagda gently by rotating your hand little by little;
and then put a little drop of gemmed oil, and lift that from the eye within. Then apply over the eye bandages or wool soaked in rose oil and abundant egg white, and bind with the healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, place over it a compress with abundant egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, for there are some people whose eyes are too hard, then you must take the instrument called "alberit," of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then insert the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work, prepare the patient for a suitable sleep, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and be free from all movement, and eat light foods, and do not move his head either to the right or to the left, and be bound according to his condition for up to three days;
then unbind him in the same dark room, and test his vision, and make him see some things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day;
and you should not do this during the hour of treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must delay this, because the inflammation rises rapidly.
if a hot abscess arises, that you loosen the bandage before the seventh day, and treat it with what soothes the abscess;
and when it is appeased, then unbind the sight and place a cloth over his face for a few days, and let him remain in that dark room.
And then gradually leave the house, and return to his usual activities;
and know that no apprentice should interfere in this case. And a man from Yrach came to us, who told us that in their land they made an almagda, with which one draws water, but nonetheless I have never seen any in our land, nor have I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and are properly of bronze: And let their heads be of this same fineness, and their tails in three sharp angles.
Sometimes there are added flesh growths on the nose, some of which look like scorpions with many feet;
and some have flesh that is sunken and a dusky color, and some have soft flesh of a good color. In that one of these flesh growths that is soft, and not sunken, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
In that one of these flesh growths that is soft, and not sunken, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and apply the lancet to those growths, and draw them out; then cut what you can hold to the fine, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the flesh is completely removed.
And if any remains that cannot be cut, you should work at it with all the fine instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if it overwhelms you, or the abscess is deep, then support it as it should be;
and if it's a malignant abscess, hasten and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then apply oil and vinegar or wine. If the oil works, and moisture comes up to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if the moisture does not pierce as it should, know that there is new flesh on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
Then you must put in a linen thread somewhat thick, and tie it with our hands, and have a space of one finger or less between each knot; and let the patient hold the end of the thread to their nose to the best of their ability, and pull it while smelling until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and many times children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for whoever wants to do it;
Then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other while holding the knots in the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have softened the flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
Do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then put a lead strip in the nose for some days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And it should be of silver or brass, similar to an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit also;
and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and have a handle at the head to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh over the nose
Many times a sickness called "telul" arises at the head of the nose, and grows and becomes large often, so that it is a visible thing to look at;
and for this, you must cut it at the beginning, and remove all of it forcefully, then place the cautery or burning medicine on the spot;
and if one delays in cutting it until it is large, beware if it is hard, of a foul colour, of poor senses:
if you do not touch it with iron, for it is an ingrained abscess, for when one cuts it sometimes, great harm comes to the sick person;
and if the abscess is of soft touch, not of foul color, and you see that it can be completely cut, empty the sick person and cut it without fear, and heal the spot with drying and tightening things.
Know that when a solution of continuation comes on one of these cartilaginous works, it profits little, except in some men.
It is necessary then when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two edges with a stitch, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the edges are already separated on one side and the other, you must cauterize all the parts of their core until they bleed, then assemble the two edges with a stitch, and compress it, and powder with powdered dragon's blood and crushed incense; and place a piece of strong plaster or other joining plaster over the powders, and leave it until it separates by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the stitch is that you assemble the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the stitching of the belly; or with thread, as I have made you know.
of abscesses on the lips
Hard abscesses occur within the lips, resembling grains of wheat, and smaller and larger;
Then you must turn back the lips, and cut open each one, and take it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then dress it with a bandage, and treat the place with dry things until it is healed.
Many times flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called "albulus";
if it is necessary, hold it with pliers, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to run;
then put powdered vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders, on the place;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, which often happens, cut it a second time, and cauterize it: if it will not return after cauterization;
Sometimes there are collections at the heads of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, sores that are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellowish and rotten, so that the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
so you must seat the patient between your hands, and his head is in your lap, and scrape the teeth or sores that appear, until nothing remains; and thus do the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other spots, until they are cleansed;
and if you remove what is there at the first application, that is good; if not, then begin again on the second and third day, until you have scraped everything;
and know that teeth require various forms of instruments for scraping, according to what the expert demonstrates, because the scrapers used to scrape the teeth have different shapes than those used to scrape between the teeth; and these shapes and others be with you prepared.
It is necessary, when you treat a toothache, that you delay pulling as long as possible, for this should not be done at all; for it is a substance very high until such time as one has no excuse for scraping.
Then, when the patient is compelled to extract, it is necessary that you be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and believes it is in the healthy tooth, and has the good tooth extracted; and nevertheless the pain does not depart by that, so long as the bad tooth is extracted, for we have already wished to do so to those masters;
And when you are certain of the aching tooth, you must cauterize around the tooth thoroughly and strongly to protect the gums on all sides;
Then, with your fingers or with delicate pliers, move it with a gentle push and pull until it is well loosened, then firmly secure the pliers; And let the patient's head be supported by you between your knees, and hold it firmly so it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out easily, take one of these instruments and gently put it in on each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with lint where the holes are; and if you grip it gently with pliers, so that it does not break when you grip it;
and it is necessary to work very skillfully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it and leave a piece behind, for the patient will experience greater pain from the root's malice than the initial pain.
And beware that you do not act like ignorant barbers who, through their haste and boldness, sometimes break the tooth, and thus achieve none of what we have described;
but sometimes cause great illness by the remaining roots, or by the broken tooth, as we have often seen;
And when the tooth is drawn, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with powdered vitriol;
and if that is not enough, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, with which one first moves the teeth, should have long points and large handles, so that they do not bend when you pull out the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And let them have large members so that they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of good, strong iron, and let them have teeth for holding the [tooth].
of the root of the teeth When the root remains when pulling, you must put moistened cotton in butter for one or two days, until the area is softened, then use pliers called "algefri", whose head resembles a bird's beak;
and let the edges be made like a file, and this is the form:
And if the roots will not come out with all these pliers, you must uncover the flesh all around the root and apply the instrument called "althali", that is to say, a flat lever, of which this is the shape:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root jumps out with this, it is good;
If not, use all the instruments, whose shapes will be shown next:
And if one uses this instrument which has two blades, of which this is the shape: and other tools that are shown before in the arrangement of the teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large pliers, of which this is the shape:
And let these instruments be strong so that they cannot break, and know that many instruments of teeth are; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and subtle masters find their own instrument, according to their work and the patient's condition, because there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument due to the diversity of others; and if one breaks a cart or other bones, where it might, then seek the necessary instruments, as I have told you, and aid yourself with the gestures, of which this is the form:
And let them be large and well-fitting to hold the bone, so that it does not slip away, but they can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with appropriate medicines, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with all this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to the natural body, and the form is ugly, and especially in young women, you must know if the tooth grew after another and is not in the right place, and it cannot be straightened or filed:
Then remove it; and if it is loose with the tooth, take this instrument, of which this is the form, and is similar to a small beak, and be of tempered iron, sharp at the top:
And cut it little by little over several days due to the tooth's hardness, and so that you do not move the others, and if it appears that it can be filed, file it with a file like this is the form:
and it is also like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it does not move until it breaks;
then smooth it at the end with a rasp, and if the tooth is too sharp and it cuts the tongue, it is necessary to file the sharpness until it is even, so that it does not cut the tongue or corrupt speech.
When the front teeth are loose, either from a blow or falling, and the patient cannot bite on food without them falling out, and you have treated them with binding medicines, and this is of no use;
then they must be bound with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes.
and let the thread be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you want to straighten the teeth, take the thread and put it doubled between the two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there are one or several, until you carefully reach the healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the covering until the part where you began, and gently and skillfully tighten your hand until it does not move at all;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, join them together, and bind them between the healthy tooth, and place them so that they do not injure the tongue;
and then leave it as tight as it can stay, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, then tighten it with another thread;
if it remains, and will serve thus for all its time, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of aligning the two healthy teeth, and the two gums, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, it is reset in its place, bit by bit, as we have said;
and let no one intervene who is not skilled and patient, and sometimes a tooth shape is made from cow bone, and it is placed where the missing tooth is, and it is tightened as we have said, and it remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament that comes from under the tongue is natural, that one is born with it; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold their head firmly, and lift the tongue;
then cut the nerve ligament, as wide as needed for the tongue to be freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or knot, and it's from a healed wound, use a hook and cut the ligament wide.
and be careful that the cut is not too deep, because of the artery underneath;
and when you have done this, lift the area with rose water and oil, or cold water, then put a linen tent under the tongue;
and the patient should bathe it each night, so the area cannot heal.
And if bleeding occurs, put powdered vitriol on the area; and if the blood is difficult to stop, cauterize it with a lentiginout cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see it with a foul color or black or hard, so that the patient doesn't feel it, do not touch it, for it is a chancre;
and if it is inclined to fester, and there is moisture, one applies a lancet, and cuts it with a sharp spatula, and releases it from one side and the other; and if the blood resists your work, apply powdered vitriol until it is stopped, then return to your work until you have drawn all the blood;
then lift the place with liniments and bandages, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of abscesses of the throat Sometimes there are boils in the throat that are called "godath", and are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then take care:
if it is a hard abscess of small size and dusky colour, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also to prevent the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will lance it, or it will burst on its own;
and if it is white, swollen, and the root is subtle, prepare the instrument to cut, but first observe if the abscess is warm and has calmed down.
Then make the patient sit facing the sun, with their head in your hand, and open their mouth, and let the surgeon take the tongue between his hands, and press the tongue downwards with the instrument, of which this is the form;
and let it be of silver or fine bronze, like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the lancet and insert it into the swelling, and pull it upwards as far as you can;
and pull out any matter from the tissues with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, which resembles a forceps; and the tips are bent, and one point the other, and are very sharp, and are made of hardened iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument present, then cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: And be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
And when you have cut one of the tonsils, then cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, the patient gargles with hot, sharp and mild water, and if bleeding occurs, the patient gargles with water, or the peels of pomegranates cooked, or sprigs of myrtle, and similar things, until the blood is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two tonsils, so cut them thus, just like the two tonsils equally.
And I treated a woman for an abscess that had formed in her throat, namely, a small abscess.
and it had almost completely closed her throat, so that the woman could not breathe through the blocked passage, and could neither eat nor drink, and she would have died if she had remained like that for one or two days.
And the abscess had grown so large that it had pushed out two tonsils through the two nostrils.
I quickly acted, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out, and extracted a large portion of pus.
then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
after inserting the lancet into the abscesses, and cut away a portion, and only a small amount of blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she began now to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to treat that abscess for a long time;
and the abscess grew again, and filled the space I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I incised it and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did to her after me.
of the eye
When mucus descends to the eye, and it is swollen and elongated, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is beneath, large and round, it is called "eye".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment is not beneficial, and you see that the inflamed abscess is calmed, and it is small, then you should cut it.
and the one that is round, gathered, and not elongated; and if it is bloody or of a dusky color or black, then you should avoid making an incision on it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the way I have described, based on its color and length, you must have the patient sit facing the sun, and press the tongue against the instrument that we have previously mentioned; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments I have mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you should not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you injure the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said regarding the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of the cutting, you should use a method to alleviate the fear.
And the method of cautery is sharp, sharp. And have the patient place their head on your breast, and then press the tongue with the instrument we spoke of in the cautery chapter, and cauterize with hot, sharp iron, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and fill the tip of this instrument, whose shape is as follows:
And have a head on the tip, where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and put the instrument with all the medicine on the sore;
and let the patient lie on their side, so that the saliva and mucus run from their mouth into the medicine, so that it does not go down the throat, and hurt the wound;
then hold your hand over all the medicine and press it against the sore, for the amount of half an hour, until you see it heal and the burning of the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around any instrument, and wet the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton on the wound, until the cotton adheres to the sore;
and do this often, until the cautery is complete, then leave it to dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to reapply the cautery with the medicine, reapply it, and after the cautery wipe around the sore with cotton dipped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and be rinsed with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is more effective than the incision, than cautery;
If it is treated with fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and oregano and rue and chamomile and yarrow and similar herbs, and assemble them all or some of them in a pot, and put water in it, and boil it;
and the pot should be tightly sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot let there be an instrument shaped like this: And let it be of silver or bronze, and let one of its ends be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the eye through the canal, until the eye is dead;
After that, repeat it often, until the eye dries, and take care that you do not do this at the beginning of a hot abscess, for many things can happen; And do not do this often except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a canal and put a piece of egg shell inside the end, so that the patient's mouth is not too hot; For the egg shell does not let the vapor burn the mouth, and it is a good cure and safe.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or some other thing, gets stuck in the throat;
Therefore, you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue with the instrument in the sun, so that you can see the thing move;
And what you do not see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; Perhaps the lodged thing will come out through vomiting;
or if the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and ties a thread to the sponge, and then swallows it; and when it comes to the place, it will harden, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out with what we have said, then take a lead instrument according to this shape:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can enter the throat more easily, and have the head raised up; and be careful that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest the whole thing come out, nor push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient pushes the instrument, so that he knows where the thing is fixed; if it pushes down, or if he pulls it out with the whole instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech of the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I have said in the division, through the use of medicines; and when this does not help at all, then look into the throat of the sick person in the sun, and then press his tongue with the instrument I have told you about.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with subtle pliers that are good for this.
And if this doesn't work, take a heated iron chain, and put it in the sick person's throat, then put a heated iron on the end of the chain, and do this often. And if the sick person is feverish every day.
then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with his hand often; and as soon as the leech senses the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the sick person with asafoetida, with the instrument I have described in the fumigation of the eye;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals, and let the pot be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole shall be the head of the instrument;
then you pour your fumigation into it, and the sick person put the head of the cane into their mouth, and close the mouth, so that no smoke escapes, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall now, and if it does not fall, then recommence the fumigation many times;
and the sick person endures thirst, and eats salty and dry things, and drinks no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to issue forth by this method.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls the leech, is, when one can see it, like bent tongs to enter the throat; and it resembles the beak of a bird of prey, and there is roughness like a file, so that what it takes, it cannot let go;
Many kinds of abscesses are, according to what recollection comes here after one and the other in this book, and they are diverse in perforation and in size;
and it is in two ways, one of which is in its own appearance, and of what it holds of moisture.
And the second way is according to the places where they are in the body.
For an abscess of the head is different from one of the foundation, and an abscess of a fleshy place is different from one that comes in joints, and each has its own judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that should not be pierced until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that must be pierced when they are swollen, and do not ripen according to their completion, such as abscesses that are beside joints.
For when an abscess comes near a joint, and one lets it fester, perhaps the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which causes contraction in that limb.
Where the abscess is near the main limb, and if you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the main limb;
or if it is beside the foundation, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a swollen abscess without complete digestion, except the one that is near the foundation, so that it does not fester deeply, and extend inside, and a fistula comes. and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for the perforation of a ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is relieved, and the fever departs, and the lessening of pain and redness, and the subsiding and sharpening of the abscess head, and the other signs;
and you must place the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears soft.
and the perforation should be along the body's length, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all places equally where there is no bending. In those that bend, according to that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be spread out, and it is full of much filth. and perhaps it hardens the lips and the depth of it.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And you should apply small incisions to small abscesses. and to large abscesses, large incisions, and many cuts according to the size of the abscess;
and if there are such abscesses where it is necessary to remove the core, and cut; when it has become like a banner, and is dormant, it is necessary to do as one does to boils:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some that are cut like the myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the inguinal region;
and there are some where a round incision is made, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those that do not have a head, like a superficial soft abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected a great amount of pus, and you pierce it, you should not remove all the pus at that time, but remove a portion; then plug the abscess until the next day, then remove some more pus again; do this repeatedly, gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small children, or decrepit old men. For the spirit sometimes trembles with the discharge of pus, so that the patient may perhaps die, and you do not realize it.
Therefore, avoid this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, dry the wound, and see if the wound from the abscess is small; and if it is a gaping wound, apply bandages of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, you must put a bandage in each one so that they come against each other;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess and have scraped it around, you must fill it with old cotton or linen rags without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs during your work, apply cold water and ease, and soak a cloth, and place it repeatedly over the bleeding area.
And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and remedies, and the powders I have mentioned in this book, and if it is winter, and the area where the abscess is is very sensitive, you must apply bandages and cloths soaked in warm wine and oil;
and if it is summer, and the area is fleshy, you must place bandages soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then drain the abscess, dry it, and treat it, as is appropriate, until it is healed.
And this must be universally understood in the treatment of abscesses:
or I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
Where the head's bone comes small abscesses, and there are many types that are like webs, just like the yolk of an egg, and many are similar.
There are some that are greasy and some where there is moisture like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony when cut, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the incision is that you test with every instrument which is called "entromissoire", from which the form comes afterwards, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then you cut it through from above, lengthwise.
And when the moisture is emptied, then you scrape off anything without leaving the skin that contains that moisture, for it returns often when anything is left.
Then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; If not, in water and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day; And that which remained from the night will run.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that nothing remains from the night;
Then treat the wound with ointment suitable to it, until it is healed.
And if the abscess holds fat, then cut it along this shape, lengthwise. and put your lancets in it, and scrape it from all sides, and put all your treatment to draw out the matter where it lies.
and if the artery resists you, then do as I have told you afterwards.
And also do this with the abscess if it is hard, and how to cut and treat it as I have told you.
And cutting on a hard and moist abscess is easier, because they are made of little blood. And if some of these abscesses, or chief, have no moisture, and of these was the abscess that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, and it could not be broken; and if one had struck it, one would have inflicted a wound as if with a stone.
In other abscesses coming to the head, except those that come to the heads of children and to the roots of the ears, the opening should always be in the most dependent place, to allow the pus to escape;
and treat them as appropriate.
Many times these abscesses occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins, and sometimes come to other parts of the body, and are large, and are intertwined with one another.
And each scrofulous swelling is properly within its own cavity, like the boil and abscess of the head, as we have said; And the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
And the appearances of these scrofulas are many. Some contain moisture, and some are malignant and will not yield to healing.
In those, therefore, that you see well-disposed to the touch, and are similar in colour to the body, and move in every direction and are not near the nerves of the neck or artery or canal, and are not deep;
Then you must cut it open, and scrape it from every side, and spread the two edges of the wound with incisions, if you need to, as we have said about abscesses of the head;
and draw it out little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or vein, and let the lancet be neither sharp nor trenchant, so that the hand does not slip and does not go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or artery, and this hinders your work, then put powdered vitriol or other powders that stop blood, and tighten the wound; and leave it until the abscess subsides, and the wound softens and begins to rot.
And when the blood has stopped, return to your work until you complete it;
Then look with your index finger if there remain any small scabs, and if so, cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scab, you should not cut the scab at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and allow it to fall off without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scab, you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch them now, since there is no excess remaining due to the size of the scab. You must cut the root of it, pull it out, and stitch it as we have said.
You must cut the root of it, pull it out, and stitch it as we have said. Those scabs that contain excess, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce it as the one previously mentioned, depending, then apply poultices with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, treat it with ointments promoting flesh growth, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the sore throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the record of their words.
For those with quincy, it is necessary that the slit in the throat, called "epiglottis," be lanced; and no help should be given by that means, because all the veins and the body of the sick person are affected by those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the tonsils.
When the disease is in the airway of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the death that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we wish to lance the epiglottis, we should lance it below three or four small slits across, between the two circles, or by the amount of the slit from the surface, not into the cartilage;
and this place is suitable for the cutting of the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far apart.
And if the master is afraid, then it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat over the entire area, and then cut through the skin until he reaches the airway; and drain the vessels of blood, if you see anything, and then cut the surface, as we have said;
and it is shown by the cutting of the phlegm from the airway which leaps forth through the broken place, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open a while.
And when the time has passed that one fears strangulation, bring together the two edges of the wound of the heart, and sew it all together without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasim says that one should not do this until the throat is completely closed, and the patient is judged to be dying, and breathing is failing. Then one cuts the epiglottis so that the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the evil of the illness has passed, and it passes in three days or four.  And then they commanded to sew up the wound and heal it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a lady took a knife and stuck it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the windpipe;
and I was called to treat her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had flowed from it, and understood that she had not cut any vein or conduit other than the throat, and air was escaping through the wound.
I hurried, and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and the lady had nothing but a sore throat, and returned to her condition afterwards;
Therefore, I say that there is no need to fear the tailoring of the epiglottis.
This abscess is called "throat hernia," and is a large abscess, yellowish in color, and is very common in women;
and it is according to two manners: natural, and accidental;
where the natural has no device.
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which one is similar to a fat swelling, and the other manner is similar to an abscess that comes from an artery; and if there is fear, and it is not appropriate to use strong efforts except in that which is small, and prove and search throughout the intervening space: If you find it like a fat swelling, and it doesn't belong to any vein, then cut it, as one cuts swellings, and pull on the whole thing, if there is any; and thoroughly examine everything, and treat it as is appropriate, until it is completely healed.
Many types of swellings exist, of which I will describe all the appearances;
and it is necessary for me to describe all the differences between a swelling and an issue.
I say that an issue is hot and feverish, as long as the boiling is ongoing, and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With a swelling, there is neither heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains a sac, which is its own pouch, and is the color of the body, and begins like a blister, and grows large;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy or moist, and many of the colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to treating the swelling, that you first test and investigate it with all the instruments called "interrogatories," according to the form that will appear in the chapter which follows.
And the way to investigate abscesses of swellings is that you should take the most moist spot you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers slowly, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then this should be according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the instrument, and be careful that nothing escapes.
If the moisture runs quickly, whatever color it has, lance it as I have said of the other abscesses;
and if after the instrument no moisture comes, know that it is greasy; then lance it in a cross shape, and take it with forceps, and lightly scrape it from each side and protect the skin where it lies so that you may remove it healthy along with the swelling;
and if you cannot remove it healthy, then remove it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the swelling returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and put soothing things over a warm abscess, and cure it with other cures until it is healed;
and if the swelling is large, then stitch the two edges of the wound, and treat it with that which generates flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary to you or another, then hurry and fill the place with broken vitriol, and leave it there for two or three days, so that the wound rots, and the blood's boiling subsides; then return to cauterize what has remained from the night.
See here the forms of the intruding instruments, and they are of three kinds: large and medium and small;
and of them there are three squares called "albaret," and one called "breb," and of them there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, for searching abscesses of fistulas;
and are also like the needles with which one sews sores, and are of brass, or iron, or silver, and those that are yellow are better, and are more proven by black lead for searching the depths of fistulas;
and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the probes are of many appearances, as you see here:
and there are probes that have two curves of three kinds also;
and there are probes that have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are probes that have two curves, and probes of one curve only, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The head of those with which one cuts is sharp, and some of these cut only from one side, so as not to cut the vein or nerve, for which one scrapes the skin.
And of these instruments are lancets fitted into handles, so that the patient does not feel them when opening abscesses;
and are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only in fleshy places, like legs, arms, breasts, and knuckles, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, resembling the bark of a hazel, according to this form, with which one stops blood: and one puts it sometimes to the place that bleeds from cuts to veins and arteries, and sometimes according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to decay, so that they appear like women's breasts;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wishes to cure them, it is necessary to do so according to this form from this line .b. up to .g.: then scrape off the fat, and fill the wound with a medicine creating flesh, then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast sags and is softened because of its size, as happens in women, then split it into two parts on top, with two similar cuts; so that one part is attached to the other at the end of each, so that the larger part contains the smaller one, according to this form, from this line .b. up to the line .g.; then scrape off the skin between the two edges, and remove the fat, and administer to it what we have said about stitching and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not entirely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or due to blood flow, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining tissue and fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are a type of hard scrofulous swelling, where there are lumps, and some contain moisture.
Those, then, which contain moisture must be cut according to this shape, from line .b. to line .g.: And when all the pus in the abscess is drained, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is like scrofulous swellings, cut it as we have said in the cutting of scrofulous swellings, and if the wound discharges pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above is closed, abscesses often result, and the same happens with a swollen vein and abscess;
and if one recognizes it as being due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightening;
and when it is due to the vein, swelling and redness are apparent;
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the joints and neck and in many other places, and is very large. Therefore, avoid iron treatment, and the one at the head should also be avoided, and in that of arterial swelling, make an incision above the skin along its length;
then make an incision with forceps, and neatly separate the artery from the tissues, until it is exposed;
then put a needle underneath it, and pierce it through to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then prick the area between the two ligatures with a probe until the blood that is there comes out, and let the abscess be relieved;
then administer the cure that produces a boil, until the ligature falls off; then treat that with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is due to the cutting of the vein, then you must grasp with your hand the part of the abscess that is on the skin, then insert the needle underneath the part you are holding, and pierce it, and have a double thread, so that you pull it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, or the ligature of one of the two sides to the two ends of the thread;
and if you doubt that the thread will not hold, then reinsert another needle all the way through the thread under the whole abscess to the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess until the superfluities come out, then cut the superfluity of the core and leave that which is healed;
then place a wet cloth in wine and oil, then administer treatments of bandages and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses arise in the artery and in the vein, abscesses arise in the nerves when they are injured, or through excessive work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and the elbows and in all places where there are joints, and it is a grievous abscess, and its color resembles the color of the flesh, and it is in several conditions without pain;
and when it is squeezed tightly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep within the body, but beneath the skin;
and moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, nor below nor above, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut by iron: perhaps a contraction would result; and the one that is on the head or forehead, pierce the skin with a lancet.
and the one that is on the head or forehead, pierce the skin with a lancet. If the abscess is small, hold it with pincers, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound together, and heal it until it is healthy.
Sometimes it happens in the belly, and not elsewhere, a swelling, and is a sickness called "fungus" due to its resemblance to mushrooms, and its root is subtle, and the head large;
and there are small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly that were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had fine roots, and were slightly split, and moisture often flowed from them.
I cut them and found eighteen ounces in one, and six in the other, and the work in the incision is such that you look to see if the sick person is moist, and the color of the swelling is white and moist and of a subtle root; if you cut it with a broad scalpel, and have the fire cautery present.
if you cut it with a broad scalpel, and have the fire cautery present. For in cutting, there is often too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overwhelms you, then hurry to cauterize;
and if you see the sick person frightened and afraid of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and bind the swelling with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the swelling, and it breaks away from it without difficulty;
and if the roots are large, then there is fear in cutting, especially for the belly, but you can easily cut half, then cauterize it so it does not return;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the tissue which is of fixed colour and poor sense and milky appearance.
For it is a festering abscess, and I will come to the treatment of sores later.
when the swelling is hard If the swelling appears due to cauterization of a wound or a surface cut, and is on the abdomen and some of the swellings come out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from wind;
And if it is from the rupture of the surface and the exit of the swelling, the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and appears with various exits. And if it is due to the release of the intestine, then it is more varied, and when it is pressed with the fingers, it recoils and then returns, and perhaps it is hardened, and it grows greatly at the entrance of the bath and due to hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and appears well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrain it.
And if it is due to blood, the abscess appears large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity; And if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you observe if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or the vein, or wind.
And if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you observe if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or the vein, or wind. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I have told you in the chapter on abscesses, because of the artery and because of the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowels, you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and be stretched out completely straight, then sign with a hot iron all around the belly; then order him to lie often between your hands, then go around the area you have marked with a hot iron, then extend the half of the abscess above the large incision; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a strong silk cord firmly, and let the wound be loose from the binding;
then open the half of the extended abscess over the binding, and put your index finger in it, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the binding, untie it, and place the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, take it to the incision and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, go gently around, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross shape that you made pierce;
then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls away by itself; or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said; and remove the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place with what is necessary, and close the wound.
about a chancre We have spoken in the division about the types of chancres, and how one should work on them with medicine, and how one should avoid using iron to treat them;
and we say that a chancre grows in the flesh, and there is much caution in its treatment, and the ancients said that when a chancre is in a place where it can be scraped off, like a chancre on the breasts and in the thigh and similar places, it should be entirely removed when it is in its early stages;
No one has ever cured one before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile sometimes;
then make him bleed if he has an obvious fullness, then prepare the patient in a good place to do the work;
then throw away your probes or ulcers, and the scab from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow freely, and squeeze the area well with your hand or with something else, and if the flow of blood is contrary to the incision of the artery or vein, cauterize it until the bleeding stops; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already discussed the various forms of dropsy, how the water collects, the signs of each type, and the treatment using medicines and treatment using iron:
and one should not use iron in these two types: that is to say, tympanites and yposarche, for it is a deadly thing;
Therefore, when you treat this type of dropsy called "eclites" with medicine, and the treatment does not help, then check if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as stomach aches and similar conditions; Then do not use iron, for there is danger.
And if you see a patient with strong constitution, and they have only dropsy as an illness, and they are neither too young nor too old, then you should proceed as follows: Lift the patient straight up into your hands, and apply pressure to their abdomen by pushing the water to the lowest part of their chest, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on both sides. pointed, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestines when inserted and cause injury;
then see if the dropsy is lodged towards the intestines: if it is, you must cut above the skin in three straight lines beneath the blade; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, let your cut be on the left side of the skin in three lines;
and if it is for the spleen, let it be on the right, and the patient should not lie on the cut so the excess fluids do not flow to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and apply it, and lift your hand through all the space between the skin and the surface, as if flaying, to the extent of a fingernail or more;
then pierce the surface until the space reaches the empty place, and that is the place of the water, then pull it, and apply this instrument, of which this is the shape: And it is similar to a thin silver chain, and is of brass or light bronze, and has one small hole on the underside; and on the side of it, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is cut like a feather, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribe cuts the feather:
on top of the head is the little handle, so that when the instrument comes into contact with the water, it immediately descends onto the instrument;
empty it then half or a third, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient dies from the resolution of his spirit or the weapon, or he falls faint, or he approaches death;
but empty it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's virtue and his pulse signify;
Then pull the instrument and retain the water, and it is now retained by the heart which stops the opening that is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce according to this manner;
Then repeat the instrument the next day, if you see the patient enduring this, and draw a small quantity of water;
Do this several days, and be careful not to continue until there remains only a little water.
And if you doubt about the patient, and leave much water in him, cure him with a hot bath or sand, and by much sweating, or a bath, and the sun, and have him drink; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healthy, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
If it is necessary, it should be pierced immediately with a very thin needle according to this shape:
then place a thin lead plug in the opening, and bind it and keep it this way for three or four days, and when he wishes to urinate, remove the plug, and let him urinate, then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine which comes to flow does not leave it closed.
Those whose opening is small are treated with a lead plug, as we have said, and it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its place are wounded, for some are born with the opening at the top of the penis, so that they cannot urinate before raising their penis; and they cannot get pregnant because the material cannot come down to the womb, and that is a bad illness.
And the method of the treatment is that the patient lies often on his back, then stretches the head of the penis and cuts it like the slit of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and beware of the flow of blood that comes many times, and if it happens, stop it with what stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Many times these boils appear on the penis, and it is an unsightly appearance of flesh;
and some are malignant and some are not;
if it is necessary, take them with a fine forceps, and cut and clean them all, then place moistened cotton on Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the boil is malignant, of foul color and stinking, then it is necessary for you to apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the boil is on the shaft, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, then it is necessary for you to remove the boil that is inside first; and when it is removed, then treat the one outside.
For when you treat them together, the shaft of the penis is not reliably safe from being pierced, and blackening and corruption come to the penis and to the testicles;
then it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate bark and figs, then treat it with further treatments until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, then administer the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cauteries aid in two dispositions together: that is to say, to the discharge of blood, and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, then you must insert a lead pipe into the penis, and the patient must urinate through it;
and when the skin is raw at the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens because of a wound or an abscess, then you must burn it with a sharp instrument, until the adhesion is broken, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is a difficult thing to deal with this, then you should burn a small area of the head of the penis and skin with a spatula;
then gently separate them and put a thin, moistened linen cloth on it, so it does not become raw again.
Circumcision is not the same as the separation of other wounds; However, when we perform this operation of our own will, especially on children, it is necessary that we do the best and easiest work for their health.
I say that the ancients did not perform circumcision on their children, as they did not use it in their laws, and we have only what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the majority of masters and nobles who performed circumcision with a knife, and with force, and with a whole new blade;
Thus, the heart fled, because there are two veins, and perhaps one above was cut, leaving the one below. Or it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and the cleansing of the wound is not certain for the tip of the limb;
and in the cleansing of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and the work is ruined, and many times they heal without needing cleansing, and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing done with force, throughout the entire thread, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for force cuts precisely both above and below.
For when you press your hand, it cuts equally in all directions at once; but let the thread be tightly wound around the skin;
and the manner of the first work should be such that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the rod, and you should make him happy in all the ways that you can;
then place it between your hands straight, and position the forces either between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then place your hand on the rod and blow into the heart, and pull it up until the head of the rod is inside; then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below one stitch to the other stitch;
then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below one stitch to the other stitch; and hold it with your two fingers by the second stitch at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two stitches, then lift the heart quickly and pull the head of the rod; then let the blood run drop by drop, for it is the remedy; and put powder on it, and on top of the powder a layer of glue made of a beaten egg mixed with rose water, mixed with good, fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The form of the forces for cleansing is this:
the two heads should be taut and sharp, and the heads should also be as large as the handle, equally.
The error in the cleansing occurs when the heart flees to the incision;
Then you must stretch it with your finger, lest the place form an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your finger, then hold it with pliers, and then cut it.
And if it passes three days, and that which is beneath the rod is swollen, let it be until the hot abscess has calmed, and lightly scrape it;
cut it as you can, and guard the part of the rod, this will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with the things for treating wounds with powders, which we have said in the treatment of powders, and if you cut too deeply into the heart, and it rises, it will not hurt at all;
Then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is caused by the obstruction of stones, or congealed blood, or by mucus, or by dead flesh, or similar things, which we have discussed in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone lodged in the bladder neck or the bladder, then the patient should be bent over their knees. And their feet should be placed on their back, and their belly should extend from the upper part of the back, and the patient should restrain their breathing as much as possible. And then the bladder neck is constricted to express the stone upwards, so that the urine is released.
And if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe", of which this is the form:
And it should be made of fine, light silver, like the feather of a bird. And its length should be a palm and a half, and it should be slender at the head.
And the method of releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the head, and put the head of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and push it to the head of the syringe, then grease the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a seat, and lubricate the bladder and the penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then double the penis over towards the groin;
then push the syringe forward towards the bladder, and the patient feels it go down to the empty space, and this is not done according to this order, except that the passage it goes through is twisted;
then pull the thread with all the wool bit by bit, and urine follows the wool, then pull it out, and make the urine flow;
and repeat the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When sores or blood comes into the bladder, or putrefaction is gathered there, and you want to instill there acids and medicines, you do it with the entire instrument called "clepsydre," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three openings: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the channels through which the medicine flows should be such that it stops the flow of urine without obstruction, so that one might draw out the moisture, and push it in when necessary;
and when you wish to inject your medicines into the bladder, place the tip of the injector into the moisture, and draw while pulling it inside;
so you will draw the moisture to the injector, and then push the applicator forcefully inside; so the moisture will enter inside, and will go to the bladder now, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysters the bladder:
And it is of silver or of lead, and the tip is higher;
and underneath to the bosom where the ligament falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put the moisture in it with which you wish to clyster the bladder, then tie it between the two breasts in the form of a good double thread, and slightly warm that moisture over the fire;
then place the tip of the clyster into the tube, then hold your hand tightly around the bladder as all the moisture flows in, until the patient feels that the moisture has fully reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle, and pierce it round about; then put a strong thread through these holes, then assemble the circle just as one assembles a tile, and put inside it what you want of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.
of the stone
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones, and the extraction along with medicines;
and have stated the difference between the stone that grows in the kidneys, and all the signs, and for which stones one should use cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that the stone which grows in the bladder happens more often to children, and this is a sign that the urine flows from the bladder in a similar way to water in its subtlety;
and it shows sand, and the patient scratches their penis, and it hangs down many times, and then stiffens; and with much of this flowing the foundation weakens;
and the cure is easy in children up to four years old, and it is very difficult in the elderly, and it is moderate in young people, those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.
And when we come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the waste that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and raise and move them downward, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes pops out from a higher position;
then make him sit between your hands, positioned so that his hands are under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards;
then search for and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut onto the stone.
And if it does not fall out on touching completely, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a mature young man; and place it in his foundation, and search for the stone, and when you feel it on your finger, then draw it to the neck of the bladder;
then press on your finger, and put it at the place you wish to cut.
And order the minister to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to extend his right hand upward towards the nipples, and with his left hand remove the skin that is under the nipples in the area where the incision is to be made;
then place the surgical knife, of which this is the shape: And cut between that which is between the nipples and the fundament, not in the middle but on the side of the left groin;
and be straight over the stone, and your fingers be at times at the fundament, and let the incision be wide at the edge, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure of the fingers on the fundament will cause it to jump out without effort;
and know that there are some stones where there are angles and edges: if it is difficult to remove;
and there are some which are smooth, similar to a ball, and round, from which the removal is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the cut larger;
and if it does not come out, you must use pliers that are like a file at the head to squeeze the stone so it does not escape; or you place under it a thin, curved instrument at the head;
and if you cannot remove it in this way, enlarge the hole slightly, and if the blood flows, constrict it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first remove the largest one from the bladder neck, then cut above, then remove forcefully, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are more.
And if it is very large, it must be softened and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: or he dies, or the urine comes out frequently because the wound cannot heal;
but nevertheless, try to pull or break it with pliers, until you pull it out in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with frankincense, myrrh and dragon's blood, and bind it, and put over it a damp cloth in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then bind the patient's neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, clean the area well with oil and water, then treat it with diaphanic ointment and basil ointment until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses appear in the wound, and corrosion, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is thereby retained, which is recognized in such a way as to leak with the urine: Then insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will corrupt the bladder and rot it;
then wash the wound with water, vinegar, and salt, and assist him in all ways that you know, until he is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, that you bind his two thighs together, and apply the medicines to the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the channel of the penis, and is stuck in, and the urine cannot pass; if you treat it as I have previously described, that you cut it many times, the cutting is excused by this treatment. I have already proven it thus.
Take an iron rod according to this shape, and let it have three angles stuck in a form of a three-pronged fork.
Then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
Then insert the rod into the penis gently, until it reaches the stone; and turn the rod in your hand against the stone slowly and gradually, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
Then the urine will soon come out, then press your hand on that which remains of the stone that is inside the penis. Then it will soon be broken, and it will jump out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
And if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, then tie a thread below the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
Sometimes a stone is lodged in women, and if it happens, the treatment is difficult, and it is forbidden for three things:
One is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a woman well skilled enough to expose herself to mirrors, especially when she is chaste.
And the third way is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well skilled in this art of hands;
And the fourth way is that the woman's stone is deeper than the man's, so that a deeper incision is required, and there is great fear involved.  And if necessity demands this, you must take a skilled midwife, and they are hard to find, and if you cannot find one, then seek a discreet, skilled mirror.
And present a wise woman experienced in women's lives, or a woman who knows part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command regarding the examination of the stone; and look closely if the woman is a virgin:
and look closely if the woman is a virgin: Then she must insert her finger into the fundament and seek out the stone;
And if she finds it, she must press it beneath her finger, and instruct her to place her finger where the afflicted part is, and search and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, she should move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder down until it reaches the root of the thigh;
Then cut at the stone at the root of the thigh, towards the middle of the opening, where it appears and is in the position, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first; Then, place the instrument in the incision; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound until the stone can emerge forcibly, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have ridges.
So, know the appearances in order to know the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, place powdered vitriol in the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone emerges forcibly, and have the instruments that I have told you about in the extraction of stones, to have men to assist you in your work;
And if the blood overcomes you, and it is from an artery that is cut, put the powder on the place and bind it with bandages and cloths, and don't try again, and leave the stone and do not remove it, lest the patient die; Then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood has subsided, and the place is healed, then return to your work, until the stone is expelled.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white pus, under the skin of the testicles, which contains the egg;
and is called "syfac," and sometimes is properly within the sac of the egg, so that one might think it is another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white pus we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: where it is a color declining to jaundice, or it is without red, or black, or watery white, and this happens more often.
and these are the signs to recognize this gathering, for if it is as white as we have said, it is a recent abscess, not long, like the shape of an egg, and the testicles are not visible, because it has moisture all around.
And if it has moisture in the proper tissue, it is a recent abscess with a part of the egg, and therefore one thinks it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white surface, one can feel it well.
Therefore, when you want to know the color of the moisture, you test throughout the cavity, of which the shape is shown previously. According to that which comes after the cavity, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, the patient must be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body.
Then place him on his back, on something slightly raised, and put many cloths beneath him;
Then sit on his left side, and command the attendant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart of the testicles;
Then take a sharp lancet, and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle lengthwise, right down to the edge of the blade, and make your incision straight, splitting the skin of the testicles until you reach the white surface, and carefully scrape it off to the best of your ability;
Then pierce the white surface with one large hole, and drain all the water, and then put your forceps, and extend the surface upward;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the surface; Cut it all or in pieces, even the side of it subtly, for if you do not cut it well and wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle jumps out during your work, put it back in its place when you have completed the work on the surface;
Then stitch together the two edges of the heart of the testicles, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, you must tie the vessels that are the suspensory ligament, fearing the flow of blood;
Then cut the testicle with the entire suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if a bone is broken into two parts together, know that these are two fragments; Cut the other part in the same way as you did the first, then wipe away the blood, and place moistened wool in rose oil on the wound;
Cut the other part in the same way as you did the first, then wipe away the blood, and place moistened wool in rose oil on the wound; and place another piece of wool soaked in wine and oil over the two fragments, and put doubled cloths on top, and bandage it securely in accordance with this method:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with wool bandages according to this pattern, and sew them together at the waist of the breeches, and one should be placed on the fundament to the back, and the other on the side of the groin;
and the other two ends should be placed over the two thighs, and the whole binding should be tied at the loop of the breeches;
and sometimes this wound is treated with a cautery instead of a cut with iron, and you should take a thin cautery knife, and cut the skin of the fragments, and heat it as we have said, so that the white surface containing the water is exposed;
then take the cautery according to this method, and pierce that surface with the prongs, and scorch it with this heated thin cautery:
And cut it in all ways that you can, until you have removed it all;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg;
and know that this work is safer; and carefully watch for the outflow of blood, and avoid the work of incision;
and if anything opposes you, whether it be an abscess, or an outflow of blood, or anything else, then cure whatever opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to endure this procedure because of its horror, administer a perforation, as I tell you. And when you are certain, by the signs we have mentioned, that the watery fluid is there, then have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the part below, throughout the entire breadth, and place the perforation lengthwise along the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the moisture runs out;
then place cotton on the spot, and bind it, and allow the remaining moisture to drain, and then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the moisture to exit the wound's opening, then you must insert a reed or an instrument used to draw water from hydrops, the shape of which is shown previously;
and enlarge the wound's opening, and know that the moisture returns and is collected after six months or within that time, and when it is collected as before, then the patient will pass their days.
Know that in the section of this branch there is fear in many dispositions, for which it seems to me that it is better to leave it;
and I will tell you the work and the appearances of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come to the body, and especially to the testicles; and it is by many cases.
That is to say, by acrid and sharp superfluity, which is spread to the testicles, or by percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and finds no pain, and is a grievous abscess;
and perhaps is a grievous, fearful, and painful abscess, and of a fixed color, and sometimes comes from a wound of an artery, or from swelling of a vein.
When it is by a wound of an artery, it is known by the disposition of a hot abscess when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it at all.
The one made from a vein's swelling is known by its disposition upon the expression of the touch of the fingers, and one can certainly make an incision on this resemblance, and on the other flesh; and that you cut the root of the testicles, then lift the testicle upwards, and pull the white part of the scrotum, and release the suspensory ligament on all sides of the testicle.
If the testicle is already embedded with these surrounding tissues, then you must pull the testicle and cut it.
And if it is air in the scrotum, or within the vessels, you must release all that membrane and cut it smoothly.
And if the origin of the tissue is in the rear, you must cut it all away and remove the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess, wrapped in a covering similar to a tumor, with softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he walks.
And the treatment for this disease is just as difficult and fearful as the previous one, and nevertheless, we will tell you its method, according to what the ancients did.
You must make the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the support for the testicles down by your fingers, encompassing all the vessels near the penis, and the master should grasp and extend them firmly.
Then, with a sharp, wide spatula, cut across the vessels, until they are exposed, and then scrape from each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries found in the temples.
Then insert a needle, with a double thread, and tie it to the first place where the viscus emerged, and tie it again to the other end. Then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and remove the corrupted moisture.
Then treat the wound as the others, where pus develops, so that no vessels burst that nourish either testicle.
For by this, no harm comes, and if viscus come to all the vessels, then it is necessary to pull the testicles out from all the vessels. So that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and it dries out and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this affliction is through the wound that comes at the surface, or stretching on the belly in the region of the groin, so that the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is at the surface, or from the stretching of it, and these two kinds come from many causes:
or from percussion, or from a jump, or from falling, or from lifting a heavy load, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the stretching of the surface, are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are equal all the way to the depths, because the surface presses on the intestines.
And the signs when it is from a section of the surface, is that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess appears varied, beneath the skin close by, and it is because of the escape of the intestines and the body escaping from the surface.
And sometimes the viscera descend with the intestines, and are trapped, causing great suffering to the patient, especially when they are pressed.
And in these iron treatments, there is fear, therefore they should be avoided.
And the method of the work is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine to its place with his hand into the wound, if it can be returned; then be supported on his neck, between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then spread the heart above, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then insert between the sides of the waist curved incisions, according to what you need to open the wound, and be such that the pus can come out;
then scrape the surface that is beneath the skin of the testicles, until the hard white surface is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between the white surface that is under the skin of the egg, and between the second surface, and separate what is behind the egg, and between the second surface;
and then move the right hand inside the heart of the testicles, and stretch the white surface upward with your left hand, and lift the egg with all its surface toward the waist; and order the attendant to extend the egg upward, and loosen what is outside behind the ligament;
and search with your fingers if there is any of the intestine wrapped around the hard white surface, and if you find anything, then place it in the belly beneath;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of X threads, and put it in the back part of the surface, which is after the skin of the testicles; after the waist, then cut the threads that appear from the strands, until there are four strands; then join them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the surface, of which we have spoken, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, with a strong tie of two parts; then wrap the threads of the strands, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter them, so that a painful abscess does not come; and put the bandage again according to the first bandage, lengthwise for two fingers of that one, and after these two bandages, leave from the surface that is beneath the skin of the testicles the width of one finger; and after all the rest according to the roundness that the egg bears;
then cut in the part that is under the skin of the testicles, until the blood flows, and the swelling subsides, as we have said before;
then apply wool soaked in oil, and put it on the wounds, and apply the bandage that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white surface that we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, due to fear of blood flow. For this happens many times, and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, then it should be soaked in hot water, and put on what we have mentioned, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is completely healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this book, I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done as the book that is with the vessel, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after the incision on top or slightly below;
then cut it in half, and treat the abscess of what is open, until the vessel drains;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the sinews, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the groin, and if any do descend, it is little, and it returns at all times;
and nevertheless, if it stays too long in this place, the wound or ulcer grows, until the intestines descend;
and this happens through the extension of the ulcer which is on the sinews, as we have said, for it is stretched, then the place softens and swells and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the place of the ruptured flesh with a wide cut according to the amount of three fingers;
and then pull out the sinew which is under the skin that covers it, then take it and put it over the exposed place of the sinew;
and press it deep into the belly, then stitch the two exposed places of the sinew onto the head of the tendon, and stitch one and the other;
then pull out the head of the tendon, and do not cut any of the sinew or stretch the egg or anything else, as I have shown you in the treatment of the hernia of the intestines; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
then treat it with the treatment for wounds. And when you cut the threads, cleanse it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The sinew is constricted, and has no appearance of rupture, and cauterization is more gentle in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the nipples
Many times the skin of the nipples is softened in some men, because the flesh inside is softened, and is evident.
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one lays the sick person on their back, and cuts the softened skin above the natural skin.
then join the two edges with a stitch, and if you wish, first stitch the excess softened skin with three or four firm stitches.
then cut between the stitches, and cure it like other wounds until it is healed, and the thread falls out.
of the chastening
Know that chastening is condemned in our law, and therefore I would not speak of it in this book.
and is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the patient must be able to answer when questioned, and know the cure;
and the other, because we often need to chasten certain animals to help us, such as goats, sheep, cats, and other animals.
I say then that chastening is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by slitting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging; then grasp them in your hand, until they are returned to their place and you feel no more pain.
Of the castration of the tail: you must tie the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut on each testicle in one blow, when you have properly skinned them;
and leave no spot of the surface and the subtle surface that is over the vessels;
and this manner of castration is gentler than that which is done by pulling, because in pulling, by chance, some part of the testicles remains, whereby the animal desires lust;
then cure the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles there appears also the form of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows out from it.
And the other manner is in women, and has a penis-like protrusion and two testicles.
And the treatment for both man and woman is to cut away all the extra flesh, and to treat the wounds as other wounds;
in the second manner, for men whose urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tentigene is extra flesh on the natural part, making it too unsightly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and that is the cure.
You must cut off the excess tentigene with your hand or shears, and cut it slightly;
and do not go too deep, lest blood flow, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and another flesh that arises on the mouth of the wound, filling it, and perhaps breaking out, and resembles a boil, and for this the ancients called it "boil-like disease". If it is necessary, you must cut it, as we said the tentigene, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic it is when the nature of the woman is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is caused by birth, or by accident through illness that has come upon it;
and is caused by birth, or by accident through illness that has come upon it; or it is by added flesh, or by a thin or thick surface, and is made deep in the flesh, or in the sides, or underneath, or wherever it may be;
and it prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the ability to have flowers (children);
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the condition.
If the numbness is close at hand, you should look at your fingers or to the side.
If it is of a thin surface and it is close to the two lips, be quick, and do it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and the woman be on her back, her legs spread apart;
then spread the two lips widely, so that the thin surface is round, and the numbness is opened;
then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and let the woman lie with a man every day, so that he cannot sweat.
And if the surface is hard and thick, you must cut it with a spatula resembling myrtle leaves.
If the numbness is of newly formed flesh, suspend it from the hook and cut it;
and have the medicines that stanch blood, such as dragon's blood, frankincense, and a mixture of egg white;
then administer a wide lead band, so that the wound cannot heal;
and thus be it for a long time, and administer a tent of dry linen;
then be treated with other cures until it is healed.
And when in the wound comes flesh growing, it must be cut according to this method, if it is not festering abscesses. For an abscess that has festered in the wound, one should not touch with fire.
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become painful.
and we have already discussed the similarities of these, and the signs, and I will now discuss those that receive a cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and pain, when deep within the wound, and they are not apparent to the touch, then the cure is not by fire.
Those that are at the opening of the wound, which can be felt, are those that can be cured.
Therefore, you must place the woman in a cold house, then grasp the pain with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle medicinal powders that constrict blood, such as oak gall and dragon's blood and frankincense, and similar things;
then place her feet against a wall for an hour, then place her in cold water;
and if a discharge of blood comes, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and oil, and make a plaster for her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, then apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts without causing injury;
Then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or elderberry juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
And the one called "albathir" is red, and is like a rough head, so it must be cut as I have said the whelp; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscess come in the marshy area, such as sores and stony abscesses and herpes and boils and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscesses, and many other illnesses that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary, therefore, that I describe in this treatise the hot abscess that comes in the marshy area, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus;
And if you wish to know the treatment for it, observe if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red, if you can see it. Then do not hurry to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is calmed;
And then have the sick person sit on a seat, and have two small seats where they lean, and rest on their back and bring their feet together at the outer parts of the leg;
and let their thighs be spread out, and place their arms under their knees, and bind them well with a good bandage;
then suck the wound towards the right side, and apply the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the ulcer, of which the form comes next;
and it is necessary, when you want to apply this instrument, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the ulcer, so that what enters the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not hurt the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the ulcer with cloths, so that the instrument does not injure it;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is open, and it is incised by hand gently, it must be cut at the top, at the thin edge;
And when the wound is empty, it is necessary that you place in the wound soaked bandages in rose oil, or in dried green oil;
and place the bandage deep within the wound, and place over the wound and over the bandage clean wool soaked in water or cooked mallows;
then treat it after two days of suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes the wound is cleansed with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water or cooked roots of lilies and aristolochia; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is reopened in the wound, you must avoid using iron, but treat it as we have described in the division.
of childbirth First, the midwife must know the natural process of childbirth, and its signs are when you see the woman pushing downwards, and desiring to smell the air.
then the child hastens to be born. Then know that this childbirth is according to the natural process, and the issue is under its head, and the afterbirth with it.
And when you see these signs, it is necessary to gently press her belly, so that the child comes out quickly.
For when it descends under its head, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the mother is cleansed of her superfluities by good cleansing.
And that which comes out otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes out on its feet, and the body or the head, and the hands, or it comes out on its belly, or often, and is sometimes turned around on its neck, and by other bad positions.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in these things, and to avoid errors and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one should help her.
If the child comes out on its head by natural delivery, and the woman labors heavily, and her strength is weak, then have her sit on a stool, or have women support her.
And apply oil or fenugreek, cooked, then the midwife should put the small spatula, of which the shape is thus, between her fingers. and cut the afterbirth, and cut with her fingernail until the moisture that is inside flows out.
and grasp the woman's belly so that the child descends, and if it does not descend, it is necessary to enema the woman with fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then make her drink and sneeze with concoction, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: Then the child will come out now.
And if the two hands come out forcefully, you must gently reposition them little by little. and if they cannot enter, place the woman on a seat and raise her feet high; then lift the seat from the ground, and support the woman so that she doesn't fall when it's lifted;
and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife that is placed beforehand, and extract the child, and reposition it likewise.
of the child's exit from its feet When the child comes up on its feet, it must be lifted up; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take it by the feet and extend it little by little.
If it jumps up to the thighs, then command to grab it, and make it sneeze by conditioning; if it jumps away, if God wills.
And if it does not jump away as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to its natural shape. For then it is easy.
And if it does not jump away as we have said, then take a handful of alum, and oil of sesame, and melted gum, and grind everything together in a mortar; and put on the woman's nature within and to keep away this ointment, then have her sit in warm water up to her ribs;
and when she is softened underneath, then make her a poultice of myrrh, and put it underneath, and leave it for an hour; then have her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and pinch her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, for the child is jumping now.
of the issue of the child upon her knees When the child comes into this form, the midwife should gently place her hands on it; then be supported on her neck, and her feet hang down, and she be lying on the bed; and gently fold her hands, and then grasp her hands above her belly, and remove the cushions underneath, until she is positioned downward; and if the child does not jump, take her feet and move them forcefully, then move her stomach upwards, then apply your hands; and draw out the child gently; and instruct the woman to brace herself so the child comes out.
of the child's birth, which comes out with one hand extended it is necessary to devise a way to bring the hand back. if it cannot be brought back, then have the woman rise and go.
if she cannot walk, then have her lie on the bed, and straighten her legs firmly.
then administer the poultice that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then have her sit on a seat, then try to bring the hand back; and bring forth the child according to the natural figure, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes forth.
of the child's exit from her neck, and have her hands spread out, and her face turned towards her mother's back It is necessary that the attendant hold her hand, then gently turn it back and forth, and bring it out gently;
and when it is equal, then put on the natural mucus of aloe and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move gently;
and when you have done this, then make her sit on the seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner to all the secondines
in this same manner to all the secondines When it comes to force in this manner to all the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs on its face and on its neck, then cut it from the bottom, so that it is not held back, and the child may die;
then put the child inside, until you have put it as it should be, and tell the woman to take some rest:
of the birth of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two are a strange thing, and do not live, if little is known;
Two are a strange thing, and do not live, if little is known; I know that they are multiplied, and are separated by the surface that divides them, which is attached to the womb;
and sometimes they emerge just as naturally as one whole child, as we have said.
And if they emerge painfully, treat them as we have said, and let the delivery be subtle, and quickly and easily do what it does; and do it thus as it is worth doing to achieve health. of many children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb in the first or second or third or fourth or fifth or sixth or seventh, or many more up to fifteen, and are all formed in the form of a child according to the measurement of the wise and glorious, and it is necessary that the midwife know all this, because by chance similar things happen. so do according to what is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman of the dead child in the womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come forth, and you are constrained to the work of your hands; if it is necessary that you know whether the woman is of sound constitution, and has no accident or fear of death;
if it is necessary that the woman be laid on her back, and her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the minister should hold her in two parts, or she should be bound to the bed so that she is not pulled down by the child;
then rub the mouth of the woman with moist oils with a mixture of mallow and fenugreek and flaxseed, then anoint her hands with these oils and these mixtures;
then gently place them in the woman's mouth, then seek the place where she places the pins that are suitable for her, and watch if the child is ready to descend on its head;
if you place the pins in her eyes or neck or mouth or palate or under her chin or in the throat or near the ribs, and if the descent is on the feet, if you place them in the heels or on the ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the pin in his right hand, and place the curve between his fingers of the left hand, and gently apply all his hand to it, and place the pin in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
then place another pin, or a third if you need it, so that the extraction is equal;
and then extend it equally by moving it from one side to the other, to cause it to come out, and let the pins be toothed to hold it, as here is the form:
And if a part remains, then grease some of his fingers with oil, and place them on that part, and pull the other part;
and if any part still remains, place this pin in a higher place, and do this so that it comes entirely out.
And if one hand comes in front of the other, and it cannot be returned because of the constriction, you must wrap it with a cloth until it comes out completely; then cut at the joint of the sole or with a knife, and thus you must do to the other hand, and to the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the passage is narrow, or if there is a sharp point of the head accumulated, you must place the sharp spatula between your fingers, and cut the head and remove the point; or you round it with the instrument called "almidach," of which the form comes with the instruments or chapter that follows this one;
and likewise do if the child has a large head naturally;
and then pull the bones with the pliers, and if the head jumps out and is held tightly by force, it should be cut open so that the moisture that is within it can escape;
and if it cannot exit, then cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, you must pierce it until the moisture runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, the pulling is slight, and the straightening towards the mouth of the wound is slight.
And if it is tight in the belly or the breast, you must pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut the belly or breast, until the moisture within it runs out;
and if the other members are removed, and the head remains, the surgeon puts his hand deep into the wound, and pulls it towards the opening of the wound; then he puts one or two hooks in it and pulls it forcefully;
and if the opening of the wound is narrowed due to a hot abscess that has formed there, one should not work on it, but rather apply moist and greasy things; and apply poultices, and soak in softened and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it upright, then apply what we have said for the living child;
and if one does not have the strength, then pull it forcefully in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then apply what we have said for hot abscesses that arise in the wound;
and if a discharge of blood comes, then it should be placed in constricting water, and apply other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had been dead, then another was sewn onto that one, and the other one died. After a long time, an abscess appeared in the groin, and it swelled so much that it opened, and began to discharge profusely.
I was called to treat it, and I thought long and hard, but the wound could not be closed.
I put on a strong-pulling plaster, and a bone came out, and after a few days another one. I was very surprised, because the belly does not have any bones.
I thought it must be bones from a dead child.
I probed the wound, and pulled out many bones, until the woman was in a better state; and the woman lived a long time like this, and sometimes a little pus would come out from the area;
and I have recorded this chapter only so that, when the master finds a strange thing, he might know how to provide help.
After this comes the form of the press, with which the books were made;
and two turns at the two ends of the two strings. However, the horns should be finer than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the opening of the tube should be one doigt wide, and the margin of the wood one doigt, and a palm and a half long; and within the two strings should be two joints of this same tube, which should be fastened on one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two joints are placed in the mouth of the mortise to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar but finer and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, resembling pliers; and have at the two ends two joints, as you see, one palm long, and two doigts wide;
and when you wish to open the mortise with the entire instrument, make the woman sit on a bed, feet dangling and legs spread, then place the two joined joints into the mortise, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then operate your hand on the entire instrument, as you did with the pliers likewise, according to the extent you wish to open the mouth of the mortise, until the patient does as she wants.
These instruments are all mounted, and their forms are multiplied; and when the smith has prepared them, so much the faster is the work, and so much higher are the men for their quantity.
Do not neglect the instrument until you have prepared it, for their necessities are not excusable.
When the secondine is retained during childbirth, you must instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then cause her to sneeze with cordials, and hold your hands firmly over her mouth and nose; and if she coughs by this, well is it.
If not, she takes a pot and makes a hole in the lid, and puts herbs in it that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be cooked in a pot in water over the fire;
then put one end of the cane into the hole of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb, and hold it until the vapors come into the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. Then the afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out quickly, instruct the woman to moisten her left hand in oil of sesamum or in the juice of mallow, then place it in the passage, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, she should grasp it and draw it out gently, so that the womb does not rupture during the extraction;
but it must be moved gently to the right and to the left, and then pulled; then it will come out and detach itself.
And if the passage of the womb is tight, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing and fumigation with herbs;
and if it is not by any of what we have said, take care that you do not force it out;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, you tie it to the woman's thigh, then administer a clyster of four-herb ointment; if it will fester and return, and come forth;
however, when it festers, a foul odor comes to the stomach and head, and hurts the sick person. Therefore, suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
None of the ancients have proven fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates a woman in the retention of the flowers and afterbirth is this:
And it resembles a chain, and one places the slender end in the nature, and the wider ends over the fire;
and let the fumigations be over the embers, and the ailment until it is destroyed, and begin another.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but it is stopped by small, subtle films: so it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that film with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and to guard the binding so that she does not touch it;
then put moistened wool in wine and oil, then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will not be stopped up again, put a lead chain in the opening and leave it for several days, and remove it when the child wants to go to the chambers.
And sometimes this blockage comes from the closure of a wound or an abscess; if it is necessary to cut that closure. it should be treated, as we have said, with a lead chain.
Fistulas that come from under the fundament are bumps, and swellings that come from next to the fundament, or in the space between the two parts, have one or more fistulas.
and when that swelling is old, it opens, and still moisture, whitish or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are piercing.
and they are recognized because gas or wind comes out when the patient expels something, and perhaps a worm leaps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce right through to the bladder, and to the middle of the penis; and they reach the joint of the thigh, and to the beginning of the buttock.
And thus one recognizes the fistula piercing to the foundation, and not not piercing: And that is that you put your index finger in the fundament, and put a fine needle of brass or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
And if there is twisting, you put a thin lead tent, or horse hair, until you feel the tent or hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and it does not come from the opening, nor wind, nor pus, as we have said: know that it does not pierce at all; so hurry to cure it.
And when the fistula pierces to the bladder or to the conduit of urine, urine escapes, and cannot be closed by medicine.
If it is pierced to the joint of the thigh, the tent is coming to the place; if there is no twisting and the source of the pain is around it, it often discharges pus, and no medicine or ointment will help close it.
and in these piercing fistulas, there is no cure but labor, and the vanity of foolish pretenders who meddle with them.
In the one that is not pierced and is not ancient, there is hope for health through iron, as I have proven, and it is that the sick person lies between your hands on their back;
and the person raises their legs up to their thighs, and has their thighs inclined to their stomach; then place a tin, or lead if there is twisting, until you know where the tin/lead comes.
If the sick person feels it around the foundation, then you should place your index finger there, and if you then feel that the lead has pierced it;
and is uncovered where you feel between your finger the surface or the flesh, then know that it is pierced; if not, do not work on it because it cannot be cured.
It is said, however, that some can be cured, but this happens rarely;
and the aid that is given is that one heats the fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it has been said before; and places it, all hot, into the fistula until it comes near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that these misplaced tissues are burned, which are similar to a bird's feather;
and then cure with tents soaked in butter, until that tissue comes out, then cure with an ointment that causes tissue to grow and fuse.
If it is thus healed, that is good.
If this, otherwise cannot be healed;
and if the tent is inside, and does not pierce the finger which is at the base, and there is a thick covering of flesh or skin between your finger and the tent, and you see the fistula from that which has covered the heart; If you cut the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward, and then cauterize after, until it reaches the tip of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those misshapen flesh that look like a bird's feather, and nothing remains.
And if the blood overwhelms you, and flows between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine.
For cauteries of fire gather two good things: that is to say, the burning of these adhering flesh, and the stopping of blood and the drying of the moisture;
then treat it with tents soaked in butter or in crushed herbs, until the place discharges pus, and the burned flesh is separated from the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that penetrate hard flesh, and are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula reaches down to the bottom, and is far from the body, then you should put your finger into the bottom and examine it.
If you feel the tent, and between it are the tissue or the skin or flesh, where it is near to pierce, then there is no other way of trust and hope, by the administration of one of the three ways:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, you put in tents and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the ligament that holds the bottom, and the secretions come out without your will; then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it since it is cut from the bottom, or by a tent or other appropriate instrument; then cleanse that rotten flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound and to keep the fistula on the part outside the bottom:
then strive to restore the wound and to keep the fistula on the part outside the bottom: it will be a lighter thing for the patient.
And sometimes there are fistulas according to this manner: and it is when you put the tent into the fistula, and it is on the side of the bottom near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the head according to this form: And he puts one thread twisted into two, and puts the tent with all the thread into the fistula until it is at the head.
If it is piercing into the edge of the bottom within, then pull out the thread from that hole, as if you put your finger into the bottom;
and pull the head of the thread, and bring the two heads together, and tighten one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and tighten it on occasion, so that the thread cuts those flesh which are between the two, and they fall away;
then treat the wound until it is closed and healed.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in every way you can, if it is not too deeply embedded. For it is not appropriate to cut too deeply for the lacing, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatumile spine, with which one opens the fistula, is very sharp on one side and sharp. and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are within the fundament, like a grain of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they often bleed, and there is one or several, and they are outside the fundament and at the head of the fundament;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and they often bleed or a little yellowish water or a little blood, and they have the color of the body;
and the cure for those who have them within the fundament is that you instruct the patient to strain himself to go to the bathroom, so that the fundament makes him bleed, and the threads are visible; if you hurry, and you pinch it with pliers, or you hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the tweezers cannot hold them due to their moisture, then you take them with a cloth, or cotton, or a piece of chameleot; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and powder them with some hot powders that are in the place of cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then cure them with other cures until they are healed;
and if the fundament cannot come out, then give the patient a mordant and harsh clyster to wash what is in the fundament, so that it can come out openly; If the patient endures, and the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is light;
If the patient endures, and the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is light; and take them with your nail or pliers, and cut them, then cure them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they dread the incision by iron. Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: Take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread over and pierce the needle on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide.
and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and remove the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave one to run the superfluity of blood;
then place over the foundation a moistened cloth in rose oil or in cerote, and place it over the foundation, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they dry, and when they are dry, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they are healed.
of the drying of the wound or foundation Many times there is drying of the bowels in the intestines, and through constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. If it is necessary, you must scrape at the edges of the scab or with your fingernail the skin above, so as not to let it moisten; then treat it until it is healed as is fitting.
and if it cannot heal, scrape again more forcefully than before, until it bleeds a lot and is scraped raw; then treat it until it is healthy.
so that it trembles. A formice is a small, false appearance around the body, and goes very deep.
And sometimes it finds the cold, and it is felt like trembling, and death comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is that you take a stick of goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that stick on the trembling, so that the circle surrounds the trembling completely. Then turn your hand around the whole stick so that you cut all around the trembling, and put it deep, and pull the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, make one of bronze or iron according to this form, and let it be thin beneath and pointed above: not piercing, so as to hold it on the finger and press it.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as it is described in the chapter on cauterization.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or gold, or of melted or wrought bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small or large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those, then, which are administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small.
Those, then, which are administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is, therefore, wide at the top, where the abdomen is bound in this manner:
and there should be a separation or the abdomen should be bound, as you see, and the bottom should be pierced;
and have two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and the abdomen, where one puts the medicines, should be made of a beast's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and have a space of one inch between each hole, then insert a strong, thick thread in an X or spiral shape around each hole, and assemble the belly as if it were a she-goat; and when the medicine is inside, bind it to the instrument with a strong thread, then administer the clyster;
and this is the shape of the circle:
And let the medicine neither be too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the minister squeezes it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then remove the clyster, and the patient should raise their legs against the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, let it come out as much as possible; and if he sleeps soundly for a night, it is more helpful.
And if you use a clyster in a disease of loose bowels, and the medicine rushes out quickly, then repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as thin as for a child;
and this is the form of the thin clyster by which the skin is constricted:
We have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the treatments of hands and medicine, according to their completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and by what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing stones, and cutting with swords and knives, or with lances or wood or arrows, or similar things;
or those made according to the parts of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar limbs;
and I will tell you the cure for each wound, and will begin with simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, then take care if it is from a thrown stone or similar things, and the skin is nonetheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear a hot abscess: then make it bleed immediately from the cephalic vein itself, if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side of the injured area;
and prevent the patient from filling up on wine and heavy foods.
And if it does not want to bleed, then his food should be reduced, and he should not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if a hot abscess comes there, cotton soaked in rose oil only, or in astringent wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood and not affected by the air, a powder, which I will describe a little later;
and if the burn has affected it, then put on some ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together with sutures, then bring them together by stitching, as I will describe for wounds of the belly or the ribs.
If the wound is exposed to the bone, and it hangs, and holds only by a little, then cut it off; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat hearty foods, such as roasted meats and cooked wheat, also as well as poultry, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it is not touching the bone, cut away all the rot, and throw it out, then treat it.
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicine, then seek out the artery, and if you find it torn, tie it with a thread; and if that does not work, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is light. and you should put this powder on so that the wound will heal.
And the way of the powder is: take incense one part; dragon's blood two parts; live charcoal three parts, and powder it finely, and fill the wound, and press it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bandage it well, and leave it without loosening, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses charcoal alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but only if the burning has not changed the wound.
And if the burning has changed the wound, especially if it is, then one does not put this powder in it;
but puts on some digested ointments, or poultices of barley flour made from water and honey, until it casts pus; then treats it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture comes with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with delicate forceps;
and I will tell you afterwards about the fractures of the head.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is a nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and not put anything constricting on it, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is also with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be soft, like heated water mixed with rose oil, and lukewarm water, and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, stitch and bind it with bandages, then let it heal until it is sound.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, pierce it in the lower area;
and if the artery is cut, and blood flows from it, stop the bleeding, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine in the throat is cut, or the trachea, and the passage is protected, through which the food goes, stitch the trachea to the throat's cartilage, and do not touch the throat, but return it to its natural shape; and then restrain the swelling, and leave it for a few days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, remove it; and if there are pieces of bone, remove all the loose ones if you can, and those that you cannot remove, leave them until the wound has pussed, and the exit is separated and healed;
and if the wound is fresh, then powder it with the powder that I have mentioned. And if the wound has bone and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, then look to see if wind comes out of the wound when the patient breathes: then know that the wound is fatal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put powder on it at first, nor bandage it because of the blood so that it does not linger deep, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but put an attractive ointment on it, and bandage it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the wound to absorb the moisture, and have the patient sleep on the wound for three, or four, or more days; then there will be no spasm, nor tremor of the heart, nor constriction of the veins; and when you see the good conditions, know that the wound is healed. Then treat it with bandages and other remedies until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and opens again, know that there is a fistula;
if you treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and it is simple, whether on the chest or back, treat it like a wound on the front; if it is large, with stitches;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it has pierced the bone, and broken pieces, clean the wound, and pull out the splinters if they are detached; and if they are not detached, let the wound fester, so the removal will be easier;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The rupture of the belly is great, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, leap out, causing their penetration;
and the treatment is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because one must put the intestines back in more carefully, if one does not replace them immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel cold, so they are more difficult to replace, and therefore a medium wound is worse, because one puts the intestines back in their place more easily than in other two.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common treatments occur in the treatment of the belly, and the treatment of other wounds of the body, and two other specific treatments are common to other wounds;
and nevertheless they are more specific to the treatment of the belly, and I will describe each one and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine protrudes, and it is difficult to return it, this is done in one of the two ways: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen due to the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a linen cloth in lukewarm water, or you cook it in water with squinant, cypress, and spices, and warm the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes use astringent wines, and it is better than water alone for reducing the swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water or with cooked rue and mallows, for by this the entry is eased a little.
and if it cannot enter, then slightly open the wound with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, that no one should cut unless there is great necessity.
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
so cut inwards into the curve and not outward, and see here the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine jumps out, then return it according to the natural form to its proper place, if you have the power, for this is worth much.
When the wound is large, and it is in the part beneath the belly, then you must make the patient lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the part beneath the belly, raise the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, then focus on making the wounded part higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, put what you have prepared, then have in your hands a compassionate assistant who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common method of sutures, and you should take a needle or several, according to the width of the wound, then leave a space of an inch from the top of the wound and insert a needle or several with strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the underlying skin, until you have pierced it through that part, and bring the two edges of the underlying skin together;
then pull a doubled thread through the needle from two sides, then bring the two edges of the wound together, and then leave an inch of space and insert another needle;
then tie the thread as you did with the first needle, and do not stop doing this as needed with the needles, until the entire wound is closed;
and the needles should be of medium size, between thin and thick, for thin needles cut through all the flesh, and too thick ones cannot enter well: therefore they must be medium;
and you must not push the needles too deep into the flesh and skin, lest they cut and damage the wound before the stitching;
and then cut the points of the needles so they do not injure the patient while they sleep, and place bandages or strips at the points of the needles to hold them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles would suffice.
The second stitching method is common, and involves bringing together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the surface with a needle and a strong, medium thread;
and when you have pierced all four edges together, return the needle to the starting point, in the manner one sews cloth;
and place the space between each stitch the thickness of a little finger;
This stitching is useful to men, and I sewed a wound a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm wide, and intestines were protruding about two palms wide, and the wound was in the middle of his belly.
I returned the intestines after it had been twenty-four hours out, and the wound was healed by fifteen days, and I treated him, and he was healthy.
And the doctors had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle.
And I did not treat him with any ointment, because I was in a place where there was none to be found, nor any other medicine; and I placed old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper ways of stitching:
Take the needle, and pierce it from the outside to the inside;
When it has pierced the heart of right to right, then leave the head of the thread or stitch where you put the needle, and pierce it from the inside part to the outside part;
And the understanding of this stitch is that you stitch just as the leather workers stitch leather, and that you leave the thread on one side, and pick it up again on the other, until the stitch is complete.
The second way of stitching, which Galen properly calls, is as some do, who assemble the two parts naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in such a manner:
Insert a needle into the nearest head of the stitch and pierce that spot only, and leave the two ends of the thread; Then turn the needle, and pierce it from the outside to the inside, at the two ends of the thread;
Then pierce each one from the outside to the inside, at two other points of the stitch which are on the other side;
and this is the middle way of stitching and the most common.
Galen said this, and some testify, that one should sew the belly with two needles, or each one with a thread;
and one should insert one needle on one side, and the other on the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh, with all its blood, before the flesh has changed it, you put the intestine back and stitch it;
then put on powdered healing poultice, and if the flesh has changed, put on any available ointment until the wound heals; and stitch the threads, and let the edges and the parts be united; then treat the wound as the others, until it is healed;
and if you do not have medicines, then put on, as soon as it begins to heal, old cotton, and move it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any further medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple;
and if you doubt that the wound will affect the main limbs, you must soak light wool in oil of temperate heat, or in rose oil, and place it around the joints and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or corruption in boils, and this often happens, then give him enemas of warm dark wine, especially if the corruption reaches the intestines;
and pierce it, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine called "jeun" cannot heal when wounded, and this is due to the abundance of veins within it, and due to the subtlety of the entire body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the herb (zirbe) jumps out of the wound, put it back in as with the intestines, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and turned black or dark, you must tie the blackened area to prevent blood from flowing, for there are veins and arteries there;
then cut what is between the ligature, and hang the two ends down from the part below the wound, to facilitate the extraction when the herb falls, and the wound swells.
of the rupture of the bladder
When the intestine is torn, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some people, because I saw a man wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it became aged and turned into a fistula, and excrement and flatulence were coming out;
I applied treatment as best I could, and did not cease to refine it until it was healed, and the area was closed.
And when I saw it closing, I feared the patient might have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
And some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestines, it should be bandaged in this way: Take a strip of linen, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the linen has opened its mouth, place it over the two edges, so that it closes its mouth over them;
and then cut off the strip's head, and this holds so that it cannot be loosened, then put another strip on in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely closed; and stitch the wound.
This chief then burns in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can bind the intestine with a fine thread cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
Take the end of this intestinal thread, which should be very lean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine linen thread, twisted; then put the thread in the needle and stitch the intestine, bringing it back to the rupture;
And this manner of stitching with strips is no stronger than according to the way of faith and hope;
And if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the large intestines, there is no remedy or skill, other than subtlety.
of fistula or that it be Know that any wound or abscess, when it grows old, is universally called "fistula", and especially when it is festered and running with pus.
And a fistula, according to truth, is a hard and white, knotted swelling, where one feels no pain, and is also festered like the feather of a bird;
and sometimes it spurts clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes little, and other times quite a bit;
and I have spoken of this in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and there is no flesh, it is no further than by one of the eight causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or because of its malice; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, that does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the cure; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because the property in the region is slow in digestion, and delays health, and swells by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Or it is necessary that I make you know the cure of the fistula that is made by the work of hands.
Know that fistula occurs in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that come to large veins, and to arteries, and to nerves, or to the surface, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to some joint of the hands or feet; and there are some that come to the property of the main member, and to similar places.
And all fistulas of this kind are of difficult healing, and there is only work, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not come to the place I have mentioned, and you are confident of the cure, and you wish to know it, then take a tin or iron tent, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then seek it with a subtle lead tent, for lead bends itself around the crookedness;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot properly seek it with tents, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture flows from one opening to another, and cleanse it;
then seek it wisely to your ability, so you know if there is bone or nerve, and if it is deep, and ask the patient carefully about the pain he feels when pressing your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove forcefully the corruption and putrid flesh that is within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is deep and straight, then you must cut deeply, as far as you can, then put moistened tents in sharp medicine, and push them down to the head of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the superfluity that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that promote healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve is affecting the main limb, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then remove it until the corruption is completely gone, then treat it with things that promote flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns to its previous state, know that you have not reached the source:
then expose and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, that is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep for you to reach; if there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with tongs, then pull it out with a suitable instrument, and if there are many bones, then pull them all out, leaving not a single one;
and if the moisture resists you, and there is no mistake or fear, cut through the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, put something on the wound to cause decay, and leave it until the surrounding area around the bones is rotten, and then the bones will be more easily removed;
and if it is a large bone, such as of the leg or thigh, restrain the corruption only until the blackness is entirely removed, then restore the wound;
and if there is a large part of the corrupted area that extends down to the bone marrow; then it should be cleaned and cut completely down to the corruption, and then cured until it is healed;
and I will tell you about a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take an example and help in your work.
He was a young man around 30 years old, who had pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, so that the matter came to the leg, and it became swollen with a large abscess, and had no apparent reason to avoid opening it;
but the physicians in their foolishness worked so much on it that the abscess opened, and a lot of matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many openings came from which flowed pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians applied treatments for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of medicine, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which they treated it, and what flowed from the openings to great bodies; and the young man's body turned red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these openings, and then searched all the openings, and found that one was meeting the other from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the openings until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted and pierced, and the corruption was reaching the bone inside;
I cleaned what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought there was no other corruption, except for what I removed;
and began to restore the wound with quick medicines for a long time, and it could not be closed;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing into the bone, and cleaned it, and then removed it, and tried hard to close the place; but I could not until I cut around a palm's width of the bone, and it was all completely rotten, then I restored it with medicines; and it was healed and closed quickly, and it was no longer necessary to start the work again except for the patient's weakness, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had of him. For because of the blood evacuation, he coughed often, but he was completely healed, and a hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or contrary at all, neither in the air nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be treated in this way: Take a ligature, and bind it to the head of the bone that is exposed, and order someone to extend it upwards; and place another bandage of wool, thicker than the first ligature, and bind it over the flesh that is above the bone, and extend the head, so that you pull the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh over the spot where you wish to be, so that the ligature does not injure the flesh;
and place a cinder or a wooden plank under the bone to help cut the corrupted flesh;
and you must continue until you can see and feel the corruption, and do so again.
And if the bone is corrupt, and does not show, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a cinder underneath, and then bandage from one side to the other side of the corruption, and let the bandage be the length of the corruption, a little, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint and bandage the bone where it is on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut it;
and if the corruption is in the finger of the hand, or in the finger of the foot, that is a very strong thing, but nevertheless you must inquire into that corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but let the vein or nerve not oppose you;
and know that the instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the arrangement of the bones and the appearance of the flesh, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and for this, it is necessary to prepare an instrument for each type of work;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the ways of diseases; therefore consider the instrument you need according to what is appropriate.
The shoulder may dislocate either due to internal causes or due to external causes;
and when you have treated that corrosion with medicinal cures, and they do no good, then it is necessary to cut that limb down to the place where the corrosion is, so that the patient escapes either by this from death, or from the worse evil, of the limb's defect;
and the sign of this is that the limb turns black, so that it seems that it has been burned by fire, and after the blackness, then that corrosion of limb to limb, and takes over the whole body;
so hurry to cut it, and if it is due to the sting of some venomous creatures, such as sea scorpions and vipers and similar ones, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it, and do not allow it to spread to the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it comes to the arm, cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no strong remedies are of any value except according to the measure of their virtue;
and do likewise when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the entire foot; and if it rises to the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the sick person to die;
and the method of cutting or setting the limb is that you tie it above and below, and have one attendant pull one of the ties downwards, and another attendant pull the other tie upwards, and you separate the flesh between the two ties to a space of one span, until the bone is exposed;
then cut or set it, and put a piece of linen on each side, so that the setting does not touch healthy tissue, and cause further injury and abscess to the patient.
And if bleeding occurs when you work, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some astringent powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man on his foot:
he suffered a blackening that seemed like a burn from fire, and that corrosion first came to his toe of the foot, until it affected the entire foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off the foot, and was healed;
and a long time later, the corrosion returned to his finger of the hand, and he came to me, and I applied restorative things after cleansing the body, and the corrosion could not stop;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of restoring the matter; and also feared that if I cut off his hand, he might die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have written this account only so that others might do likewise if needed.
Sometimes an abscess occurs in a fleshy area and lasts so long that it gathers a large amount of pus; and then it bursts and the pus escapes, and the area remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin above is as thin as delicate cloth, and does not reach the bone, nor the nerve, and such an illness is called "sinus" and is not called "fistula";
but if it extends so far as to reach the bone deep down, then it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you must cut all the surrounding skin, especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it will not heal due to its corruption.
And if you believe that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with an enema like this:
See if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes out has a foul odor, then irrigate it with Egyptian medicine which is made like this: Take oil, and litharge, equally, and put them in a pot over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
And then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and irrigate the wound, and compress the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the swelling is cleansed, and the foul smell is gone;
And sometimes irrigate with water of ashes, when this medicine isn't available, and that you take ashes from a vine's wood, and pour water over it, then strain it, and irrigate with it until you know the swelling is well cleaned;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the water of ashes, then irrigate with water and honey, or if he has a little bit of litharge ground; or you irrigate with honey and mixed wine, for the honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine makes the swelling dry;
and when you have done this, and you have ensured that the swelling is well cleansed, then irrigate it with that which causes flesh to grow there, and that you take a diaphinit plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you irrigate it with some medicines and ointments, of which I have discussed the properties in the treatment of ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the tip of the enema cannot enter, then widen it a little with an iron instrument, and place there a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basil ointment, until it is enlarged;
and if the wound is too wide, then stitch it, leaving only the area where the enema can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is on the top, then cut it or a lower area where it is.
and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, then arrange it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest place possible, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, then arrange it in this manner: so that the pus runs easily downwards, and nothing of the pus remains;
so that the pus runs easily downwards, and nothing of the pus remains; and take consolidating medicines to put on the swelling, and spread linen cloths over the entire swelling; then cut as deep as necessary to widen the opening of the swelling, then spread a soft ointment over another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the opening of the swelling to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth at all except after many days, one time;
and the one that is over the swelling's opening, remove often to remove the pus, and know whatever comes from the pus, if it is venom or little or enough, or digests, or indigestible;
and watch if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this manner and you see the nature that rises over the opening of the swelling, then know that the swelling is already healing, and health approaches;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health approaches.
For there are people whose wounds take a long time to heal, and others who heal the opposite way.
And if indigested pus leaps from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal;
And if the swelling is slow to heal and is prolonged, add drying medicines, moist in substance but dry in virtue, such as the diafinit ointment, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and this is the final medicine;
Take the diafinit ointment, and make it with rose oil, and mix it with equal parts of old wine in substance;
Then prepare and use it;
And this same thing, better cooked and thickened, when diafinit ointment is not available, or you take myrrh, aloes, and incense, and grind them, and powder them over the honey while it is over the fire;
And then apply it in strips, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes administer a long aristeoloche root, and the roots of the lily of the valley, which is also like the flour of vetch and centaury; and use it in simple or compound forms: Grind them, and make a powder, and put it over the honey I mentioned, and use it;
And if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and has made an impression on the bone, or the hard tissues, or the ligaments; if the cure of the fistula is as we have said before.
Panaricium is an abscess that arises under the nail of the fingertip of the hand, or of the foot, or perhaps arises in other fingers;
and when it is old, and one does not take heed, it becomes a deep abscess, and it spreads and discharges pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it spreads across the whole nail;
and the decay reaches the bone, until there comes a foul pain, and the fingertip is swollen, and the color is dusky.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not benefit, you must cut away with a sharp instrument all the excess that remains of the nail, and then cauterize the wound afterward. Cauterization is very helpful if the bone and nail are healthy;
and if the nail presses against the flesh, beginning to prick and wound it, you must place a wedge under the nail that is pricking the flesh, and push it upwards, and carefully and gently cut the flesh, and apply burning and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh to remove it all. then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corrosion is in the bone, you must cut it open and remove the pus, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal.
And if you see the finger becoming corrupted, you should cut it open in an 'I' shape, as previously described, and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is injured and bruised, and it feels great pain, you must first treat the wound.
Then cut the nail of the spathula with a sharp, transverse cut, and watch that the cut doesn't reach the flesh under the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain.
And if it happens, place something on it to soothe it.
The swelling that arises in some men's hands by chance is all fleshy, and sometimes there is bone, and sometimes there is a nail.  Some arise at the joint's root, or their origin is in some of the fingers' bones.
The swelling that arises in any fingernail does not move, and that which arises at the finger joint sometimes moves.
The size of the fleshy one is slight, in this way: Cut it at its root with a wide scalpel.
The swelling which arises at the joint's root is difficult to cure: So hold it, by cutting.
In that which arises or is due at the back of the neck, you must first cut the rounded flesh down to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable knife, and then treat it until it is healthy.
The swelling that comes to the fingers together comes by birth, or by the uniting of a wound, or by burning with fire, or by similar things.
You must cut that swelling so that the fingers repair according to their natural forms. Then place between two tents or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not unite. or you place between two pieces of thin lead, until the place is healed, as is necessary.
If swelling comes to any of those fingers with the palm, cut that swelling as is necessary.
Veins are large veins wrapped full of melancholy superfluities, that come in many parts of the body;
and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you should administer a purge of phlegm, and then heal with the basil.
The treatment of iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and black blood is drawn out; and the other way is that you bind the vein, and draw it out fully.
The cutting is according to this manner: first, raise the leg with very hot water, so that the thick blood is thinned, then hold the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the area below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or two or three, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood into your hand, from one end to the other, as much as the patient's strength can tolerate;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods producing black bile;
and recommence the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and harms the patient.
The raising of it is according to this manner: raise the leg of the patient, if there is much hair, then place it in a bath, and warm the leg with hot water until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, then warm it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the top of the knee, or in the part below the ankle;
then open the skin with the lancet, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when touched;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it looks like a white cord;
then put the rasp underneath, until it is lifted from the skin, and then scrape it lightly with the lancet, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the rasp, as you did before, and scrape it with another lancet, as you did first;
then make another cut, or several if you need, then lift it, and cut it at the toe of the foot, then pull and lift it until the second cut;
then pull it from cut to cut until it is completely out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a needle with a strong double thread, and tie and pull it, and put a rasp underneath, and turn your hand back and forth until it comes out; and watch that it does not cut, for if it cuts, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and harm comes to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, put moistened wool on the wound's place in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, twisted, and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it crookedly, but do not cut it; and pull it out as we said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vein is curved, and does not cut straight, so that it does not cut the vein;
and is of large curvature, for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the shape:
This vein is entwined in the legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and in dry land where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the rot that comes under the skin, as it comes inside the body of serpents and worms, entwined between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes to the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like the root of a plant.
When the vein appears, you must wrap around a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces, and the knot, and leave the lead hanging on the leg, and every time any comes out to the outside, wrap it around the lead and the knot;
and if it is too long, cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it is entirely out. for if you cut it, it returns into the flesh and causes abscesses and rot in the place, and a bad illness.
for which reason it is necessary that it be treated little by little until the end, and nothing remain in the body.
and sometimes this vein, when treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man came to me once, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, insert a knife or a probe, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out;
and let the matter within be emptied, and apply healing medicines to the place to prevent any rot, then treat it as abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it opens at the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many small openings appear from which it spurts forth.
Then treat it as we have said before.
of worms that arise between skin and flesh This ailment is called "ox disease" in our land, because it often afflicts oxen, and it is a small worm that arises between skin and flesh, and it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, and one feels it clearly moving from limb to limb, until it pierces the skin where it goes and causes a boil.
and it is bred by corruption of certain humours, as do worms and serpents and leeches and ascarides in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it travels through the body, and it ascends to the head, and it reaches the eye, by chance it enters and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you wish to cure and extract it, it can only be done when it is moving.
so it is necessary that you bind the location above and below with a strong bandage tightly, then cut above and pull it out forcibly, and if the worm is deep within the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire above, so that it dies.
and the greatest harm that it does is that it damages the eye, as we have said.
and if you see it coming near the eye, hold the eyebrow tightly beneath it, then cut above it and pull it out forcibly.
and the patient must use cleansing body remedies, solutions for bad rotten humors, and abstain from foods that cause putrefaction.
of the pain that comes from wind. This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in some limbs, and can move from limb to limb.
and I saw those that I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of her arm.
and a little later, I saw it rise like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quick silver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran throughout the body, until it reached the other arm;
then she told me that it often circled around the body, just as I saw it.
I marvelled greatly how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many who had experienced pain moving from one place to another, but I had never seen it like I saw it in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a thin body, and exposed veins, and for this reason the windiness was apparent;
and it is not apparent in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then quickly bind it above and below, and then cut above so that the constrained windiness in the place is released. and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with those that expel windiness, like fetid pills, and pills of saffron, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearance and according to the places of the body where they strike.
The diversity of them is that there are some that have large points, and small, and feathered, and soldered; and some that have two angles, and some that have tongues, and some that have pieces;
and the one that strikes any limb strikes in two ways: or in a chief member, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it falls, then, in any of these members, and the sign of death, which I will tell you later, appears: so you must beware of the extraction of this arrow, for death comes afterwards in many conditions; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deep, pull it out and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow strikes it and pierces the bone, and the soft tissue on top of the brain is torn, are: scotoma and dizziness and paleness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps there is fluid flowing from the nostrils or ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and from the wound there flows white moisture resembling pus, and also burns the flesh;
and if these signs appear, then refrain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not embedded.
The sign of an arrow striking the heart is when it is near the left breast, and feels as if it were lodged in hard matter, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat, and fainting come; Then know without doubt that death will follow.
And the sign of an arrow that has struck the lung is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and gasps loudly and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the breast, it is near the small ribs; and causes great pain and great suffering and gasps; and all the shoulder members move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something of undigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and a bit of straw spurts out through the gut, there is no hope for treatment, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts out and comes forth, and the sick person feels great pain: know that the wound is fatal.
The other limbs, such as the face and neck, and throat, and shoulder, and shoulder blade, and the spine of the back, and the forearm and thigh and legs, and similar limbs, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not poisonous, as I shall tell you what happened to me, so that you may do the same.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of his nose: I tried it, and extracted it from the other side beneath the fat of the ear, and he was healed without difficulty.
And I pulled out an arrow that had struck him in the eye's fat beneath the lower eyelid, and the arrow was lodged, and I could only reach the tip towards the shaft, and the arrow was large, from a Turkish bow, with all the iron light without wings;
The man was healed, and no bad accident occurred to him.
And I pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic with wings:
I softened the (surrounding) tissues, and I worked so finely that I pulled it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I pulled an arrow from a man, which had struck him in the belly, and I thought that he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, he did not change his condition at all; I cut around the arrow, and I removed the shaft, and I pulled it out completely, and there was no bad consequence.
And I saw a man whose arrow struck him in the back, and the wound was sealed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and his natural disposition did not change, nor did he find harm in any of his natural activities.
And I saw another man, who had an arrow strike his face, and the wound was sealed over; and remained thus without suffering much pain;
and many others like these.
And he extracted an arrow from a nobleman of the king, that had struck him in the middle of his nose, and was slightly slanted to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had been embedded for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very fine probe, and didn't feel anything; and he felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the arrowhead. I placed an attractive and digestive plaster on the spot, so that the area wouldn't swell; and the arrowhead's location appeared to me.
and the arrowhead's location appeared to me. I applied the plaster again, and the wound healed anew, and the patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead in his flesh one day;
and he told me so. I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound repeatedly, until it was open, and probed it, and felt the head of the arrowhead that was beginning to appear at the spot;
then I added more of that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound, until the arrowhead's tip became clearly visible;
and the healing took approximately four months, and then the wound widened so that I was able to insert pliers, and moved it from one side to another, and it could not come out;
then I did not cease to devise and invent different instruments, until I obtained a pair of well-made pliers, according to what their form will be at the end of this chapter, so that I extracted it, and healed the wound.
And the doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely healthy.
Or I have told you the quality of extracting some arrows, so that you may apply your treatment to what I have not said, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but skillful masters consider even small things, and what is present and lacking, to find new work, and new instruments, in response to the strange things that occur in this art.
I say that arrows do not exit the limbs in which they are lodged except in two ways: or through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and the one that leaps out through the place where it enters, is an arrow that entered flesh, and sometimes leaps out now.
And if it does not leap out now, leave it until the flesh around it is rotten, and the exit is made easier;
and also if it is lodged in the bone, and cannot exit, leave it thus for a few days, and move it each day;
and then it will leap out, and if it does not leap out, pierce around with a very thin drill, until the surrounding area is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged inside the body where it cannot be seen, then search for it throughout the entire wound. and if you feel it, then pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot due to the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve or vein, then enlarge the wound until it is large.
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs with which it holds, then remove the flesh that is stuck in two places as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow so that you can pull it out.
and be careful not to break the arrow, so that you pull it out more easily.
And if you cannot at once, then leave it until the surrounding flesh is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood makes you uneasy, then administer what we have said about the cure in its chapter.
and beware of cutting the nerve and vein, and devise how you can remove the arrow without danger, quickly or slowly, firmly or gently.
and place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest aid there is, and if you cannot, then place him according to the signs that show you.
The arrow that comes from another part, or if anything is evident from it, or the skin is swollen in a place that can be seen or felt clearly:
then cut above it, until the pliers can grasp it, and then pull it out. if it leaps out now.
And if it is lodged in the bone, then turn your hand round and round until it enters the bone and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it for a while, and then resume pulling until it leaps out.
and if the shaft of the arrow is in there, pull it out with the entire shaft.
and if the shaft has fallen, and you want to apply a pushing instrument, then apply a pointed instrument, so that the tip of the arrow enters the point of the instrument.
and then push strongly, and if the arrow is pointed, push an instrument with a pointed end inside to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is embedded, you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if possible, then treat the wound as appropriate.
And if the arrow lies in the groin or the belly or the bladder or the ribs, and it is close to the surface, and you can cut above it, then cut above it;
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then close the wound if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pliers with which arrows are extracted are similar to a bird's beak, and see here the shape:
And there are many kinds of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the arrow-head shaft is also like the feather of a bird, for thrusting at the tip of the arrow, so here is the shape:
Of the veins from which one bleeds are thirty-one, of which there are sixteen in the head, that is to say: Two beating ones which are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are in the two apparent temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two veins which are in the neck; and the two veins that are on the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins commonly treated are five in each arm:
One is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the common people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste," and is composed of the cephalic and basilic, and the common people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "vein of the belly," and it is above the fossa, and it is the one that is commonly treated, which is clearly visible above the wrist.
And the salvatelle is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the foot on the left side, and the second is on the ankle of the right side; and the vein called "nesse," which is on the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins behind the ears helps with chronic colds and headaches;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient tightens their neck with a bandage, so that the two veins appear behind the ears in two places depending from the head: then grasp them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse beneath your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet and place it beneath the vein to the bone, then raise your hand over the entire vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein cleanly twice, and cause the blood to flow as much as you wish;
then restrain and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already described incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for chronic migraines, and severe, and habitual ophthalmia, and for sharp eye aches.
and the qualities of bleeding are as I have said: and the patient is to press their neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse beneath your finger, then bleed from the inside.
Then lift the heart above the vein to your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done to the other two veins, and make the blood flow according to your need;
Then release the patient, and put your finger on the vein for an hour, then apply cotton; and then bind it firmly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cuts and their extractions, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein in the forehead is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for diseases of the face, ancient ailments, and migraine, and redness.
and the quality is such that the patient tightens his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument called "fosaire," of which this is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and strike it with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow out according to the quantity you desire; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed, and sometimes the work of a wide flame.
However, the flame should not be too sharp; and the flame should be placed sideways, for the bone is near, and perhaps the flame will break when it is thin.
The incision of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts aids the eyes, and the inflammation, and redness, and the inflammation in the eye, and the illnesses of the face;
and the quality of their incision is such that the patient constricts his neck by twisting with some binding, as before;
then the incision, and let the incision be across, a little along the flame a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the flame is thin, perhaps it breaks;
then make the blood run, as much as you need, and then bind over with cotton, and bind it well.
The incision of the vein near the nose is good for fever, and for sudden madness, and for facial illnesses, such as migraine and redness that comes to the face, especially when it is old;
and the properties of the incision are that the patient strains his neck, then presses his nose into your left hand, and take a thin long flame, and insert it into the lip in the space between the two nostrils, for the vein is not clearly visible there, and the blood will now begin to run;
and do not go too deep, and make the blood run according to your necessity, then bind it for a night, for it is very quickly restored;
The incision of the two cheeks helps with the constriction of the throat, and in the beginning of swelling, and in many illnesses, and in impetigo, and in scabs, and in herpes, and in ulcers;
And the quality of the incision is that the patient strains his neck from both sides, as we have said;
And let the master be standing over the patient's head, and the patient sit on a seat, then incise the vein along a little width, then draw the blood moderately, or as much as is necessary;
Then do the same to the other vein, then loosen the ligature, and moderately constrict both veins, so that the patient does not choke; and leave it until morning, so that the wound is healed.
Of the incision of the lips The incision of the veins in the lips above helps with phlegm in the mouth, and with the corruption of the gums, and the splitting of the lips, and the nose and throat.
And the method of the incision is to have the patient sit in front of you, and to hold their neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, one being on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognized by their blackness, and by the fact that around them are small, black veins:
Then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest of each side, and do the same with the two veins above and below, for it is the same method.
Of the incision under the tongue The incision of the veins under the tongue helps after the incision of the cephalic vein, and it is for constriction of the throat, and for ailments of the eye, and ailments of the mouth;
And the quality of the incision is that the patient sits still between your hands in front of the sun, and lift the tongue, and look underneath on each side for a black vein:
Then cut one and the other, and do not go too deep, for the arteries are underneath.
The veins of the arm that are commonly incised are incised according to two manners:
or by pricking with a wide, sharp blade, or a thin olive-shaped blade like a cutting knife, and it is called "anesil"; and are wide and thin according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the sharp blade is very famous, and is wide as you see:
And it is necessary for opening the veins filled with thick, visible blood, and that contain thick and troubled blood; and that is the shape of the olive-shaped blade:
and is more slender and pointed, and is for lancing thin veins, where there is thin, yellowish blood.
The lancing of the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps those maladies that are under the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the abdomen;
and it is fitting for the surgeon that he lance wisely, and that he beware of the artery that is beneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a hemorrhage of blood comes, it should be stanched, as I have said; and the lancet should not be piercing, but cutting, like a knife.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, you must press it and change to another; or you want some vein of it, or you lance in place of it the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and the cut with the lancet, like we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the incision, then you must first compress the arm, touch the place until you know the pulse; then mark the place with a mark, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the lancet; and be careful not to hit the artery when you see the place bleeding, for it is of the artery: Wipe it then.
And if you see it gush out like a child's urine, and the blood is red and subtle, know that it is blood from the artery: Hasten then, and place your finger over it for a long time, then remove your finger if the bleeding stops, which often happens; Then tie the arm, and leave it thus, and let the patient not move it;
and let it be in fear, and let him not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overcomes you, and the physician is not present, if the artery is exposed, cut it, for the head will retreat; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of fig bark, and split it, and take one half and tie tightly until the next day;
if the blood stops, that is good; if not, treat it as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the stopping of it is not difficult in many dispositions due to the small size of the wound, and the strength of the arm's binding.
The vein's bleeding assists by drawing blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilica and cephalic, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the practitioner to be careful of the nerve beneath, and if it pierces too deeply, and finds the nerve, it swells and the wound is difficult to heal, and perhaps cannot heal;
and this nerve is often exposed, and if it is not exposed in some people due to its subtlety, you must drain it with a lancet; and dry the nerve to your power.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head and aids the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking the olive vein or the myrtle vein, for it is the safest of all veins, for it has neither nerve nor artery underneath. However, one must seek the easiest place, and do not hurt anything if one fails the first time, and one starts again; and perhaps the place swells in some men when one fails the first time, but it does not hurt anything.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your thought.
The first thing you should know about bleeding is that it is not administered just for any reason but to maintain health and avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow: that is to say, cephalic, basilic, and median cubital; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear;
and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding administered to the sick has no set time, but whenever needed, by day or by night, at all hours and in all times;
and it is not appropriate to bleed children until fourteen years of age, nor women carrying a child except from the fourth to the seventh month. And the elderly who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled, in whatever manner, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines with a gentle clyster, if they have retained much waste, so that the veins do not draw impurities from the intestines harmful to the principal limbs;
nor should those who are overly full of food, nor those who are drunk, as long as they are feverish, nor those with dropsy, be bled.
and one should abstain from bleeding after a bout of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, and excessive exertion in women, and from labor, from staying up late and fasting, and anything that depletes the body's strength, whether through the mind or the body.
then subtly reduce the humors, if the blood is thick, through food and drink and medicines, if you have the power to do so.
then enter a bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein on the breast near the third rib, as we have said.
and guard yourself that day from work, and hardship, and lust, and similar things.
and be relaxed and joyful, and let the leeches be higher than the person being bled, and rub the arm two or three times, then tie the bandage moderately, for if it is too tight or too loose, the blood will not flow.
and then rub the area with your hands until the veins swell and are felt.
Then the leeches should moisten the flame with a little old oil, and then place their left hand's finger on the vein just below the area where they want to bleed, so that the vein does not burst when struck.
For there are veins that flee like ropes when bled, and some are full of wind, so that when you place the flame, the flame retracts, and the vein cannot open, and so it is with those. And if the vein does not open, the wound is too narrow, therefore the leeches must be careful in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good. If not, begin again a little below or above the place, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, let it be for one or two days, and do not bind the arm. Perhaps a hot abscess will come.
Do not enter the bath, then restart the bleeding if it pleases him.
And if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you fear that it will not release as much blood as you want, then apply the flame directly to the opening itself.
And work a little hastily, before the place is swollen. For this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not restart the bleeding, but place a little linseed oil, for it alleviates the body of blood, and the linseed is milder in this place than oil.
And thus administer the linseed oil with every incision you make in the veins, to stop the flow of blood.
And this same thing makes the wound and sores better when it is placed on the place. It thins the blood and separates it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess forms, which happens frequently, especially when the incision is not deep enough, or when the vein opening is small, hurry and place a sponge soaked in hot water and salt on the area and hold it there for an hour.
And you should do this after the blood has flowed from the vein, and if any blackening or greenness remains in the area after a few days, it does no harm. And if you wish, apply something made of aloes or myrrh mixed with juice of calamint, or similar.
And many times, abscesses and appearances occur at the site of the basilica incision.
Therefore, place your hand on it, and if you find the area soft when compressed by your hand, that appearance is bad. Then, stop applying anything of the things we have mentioned, because perhaps an artery is ruptured.
But make a dry poultice to harden the area, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And draw off each quantity of blood according to its virtue, and the colour of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let so much of it issue until it is red. And if you see it thick, leave it until it is thinned; And if it is too hot, let it cool down.
And it is necessary for one who is robust and needs bloodletting that a larger wound be made, and the incisions be wide.
and for the weak, do the opposite, and it is necessary to bleed him little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this way of bleeding is safe from blood flow and nerve damage, and is better than bleeding from the long or the wide.
And to those whose bodies are failing during bleeding, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold disposition, he should eat bread soaked in syrup of figs, or in syrup of aromatic honey with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bleeding, after the outflow of much blood, he should drink broth of meat, and subtle scented syrup, and use the other things that we have discussed in the section or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wishes to let his arm vent, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by excessive bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his continuing strength.
And he who wishes to let his arm vent after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, should bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wishes to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; so a great quantity must be drawn, and the opening widened until it bleeds profusely; since you observe all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand upon his pulse while he bleeds, so death does not come instead of profuse bleeding, and this happens many times when the blood-letter is negligent;
and it is not necessary, when you wish to loosen the arm and make blood issue a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press forcefully upon it; nor if it is crooked, that he extend his arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but let him bleed a second time; or you prick it with the point of the flame, so that the blood which is congealed in the opening of the vein issues forth, and place a bit of moistened salt on it, and press lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, then bleed him in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the vein in the head because it is better.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the vessels are red;
then it is tied moderately, so that the vein appears clearly, then bleed it straight through, not wide nor long;
and let the opening be wide, and be bled close to the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, then put the hand in warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is summer, then do not put the hand back in warm water, for it is put more in winter than in summer;
and the bleeding from this vein is safer than any other vein, for there is neither artery nor nerve.
Bleeding from the vein of the right hand is good for all liver ailments, and this is the method:
Hold the hand tight, and put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if the bleeding is across, and if you cut it completely, then nothing will be harmed;
and do not go too deep, because the nerves are beneath, all bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is frozen in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, then put oil and salt on the vein to quickly seal it, and do this with each vein.
The bleeding in the left hand is helpful for the mice disease, and do everything as I have said for the right.
Bleeding from the sophene is good for all diseases beneath the body, such as diseases of the marrow, and retention of flowers, and diseases of the kidneys, thighs, and old legs, and similar illnesses.
And the method of this bleeding is that the patient puts their foot in hot water, and rubs the vein until it bursts, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot, many kidneys go there;
Then bleed where the kidney is largest, or at the ankle, whichever is better.
And if you bleed above the foot, watch out for the nerves that are below, and bleed through as if you were cutting;
and let the fire be gentle.
And if the blood cannot come out, then return the foot to the water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, then start again a little higher the second time, for the place is bad.
and do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and thus do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot as well.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the heel of the foot, and its bleeding is worth the pain of the hip, when it is for hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is that the patient enters the bath, and tightens above the ankle four fingers by twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, then bleed it in every way that you can, and crosswise. and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very responsive to hands.
and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very responsive to hands. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and cause as much blood to flow as you wish, and then loosen the ligature, and put on cotton and tighten it; It is now healed.
Cups are made of horns, or of brass, or of glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping that is without striking is in two ways: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and cupping that is done by striking and by drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, of which one is right on top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others in the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping of the two shoulders; and the cupping above the buttocks; and cupping between the two arms; and cupping of the two legs; and cupping of the two ankles;
and the cupping draws no blood, except for small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore does not weaken one, as is done with vein-bleeding; and it should not be administered, neither with nor without fire, in any illness that comes from fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
And if, due to the necessity of illnesses, or by custom, one must apply cupping, one should administer it each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between, and at every time.
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and in their neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have their tongue swollen, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we order cupping after three hours of the day.
The bleeding from the temples helps the heaviness of the head... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary for this to be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bleeding from the cephalic vein, and it is not fitting that one of cold complexion use it, or who has a cold, for this does them much harm;
And therefore it is not fitting that the elderly use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And those who often bleed from it become forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower, for fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bleeding from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for tightness in the chest, and for a tear in the windpipe, and for everything, and for fullness;
and it should be applied gently, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness in the stomach and the heart.
Cupping on the second ribs of the neck is good for head aches, ophthalmia and migraines, and for strangulation, and pain in the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bleeding from the basilic vein;
and you must tell the master to press his hand when applying it, so that he does not cut the artery, and there is no excessive bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is good for diseases of the mouth, and for corruption of the gums, and similar illnesses that are in the mouth; and it is in place of bleeding from the two lips.
Cupping on the shoulders is good for illnesses that come from heat and fullness.
Cupping on the elbows is as good as cupping on the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins;
and instruct the master not to strike too hard or deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and is near nerves and arteries.
The cupping placed on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament and for illnesses below, and the cupping should be large, and of bronze, so that it is good at drawing; and perhaps, if it were thin, it would break. and it would make large wounds.
Cupping on the legs draws blood openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains in the kidneys, and the bladder, and the uterus, and they remove the bad things;
and are in place of two leeches, and two bandages, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause weakness in many conditions.
The manner of applying a cupping is that you first put it empty, and gently suction, and quickly put it on, and move it evenly, and do not cease doing this until you see the area reddened and swollen, and the redness of blood appears;
then stop, and put the cupping away, and be watchful of the body's condition, for there are those who have delicate flesh, and thin bodies: so it is appropriate to strike only once, and it is appropriate to make wide wounds, and somewhat deep ones; and gently suction.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to thin the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike the third time;
and when we want to draw little by little from the blood, we should suffice with only one strike. And if we want much blood, we recommence often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those with thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with arousing and dissolving oil: if it is in this state, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or oil of pumpkin seed;
and if it is in winter, with oil of cress, or lilies, or chamomile, or something similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take astringent oil, or balm oil, or anise oil, and the like.
And if the one being treated has tender skin and wide pores, one should not put any oil on it, but it should be washed after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or mulberry water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And those who have much moisture, let them rise with oil of myrtle, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities, let them rise with old wine, or water of saffron, or a decoction of anise or chamomile, or similar things;
and one should not be bled by cupping before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath an hour or two;
and do not sleep after cupping, and one must be careful, when one is to be cupped and when one is cupped.
And beware if the person being bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; if so, he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces in the shade, and similar things; and eat young pigeons, and hare meat, and moist foods.
and eat young pigeons, and hare meat, and moist foods. And he who has a cold complexion should take syrup of honey, and middling fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat young pigeons and small birds and young pigeons;
and the day he is to be purged, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes treacle or nutmeg before or after the purging, to strengthen the principal members; and the blood should be thinned, but it is not appropriate for those who are hot to drink it.
The cupping that is applied without striking is that applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the buttock and the kidneys and the hip, for these members do not tolerate being struck on them, and it is done only to draw blood from member to member, just as we apply to the breasts when the nipple bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the member, as we apply cupping to the belly and buttock to thin the member;
and it relieves the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, so it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and thus it acts when it is applied to the liver and the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cupping glasses are applied empty only to suck; and sometimes are applied with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in illnesses of the pleurisy, and in such a manner that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which one has boiled suitable herbs for that.
The form of the cupping glass applied with fire is thus:
And it should have two fingers in width and half a palm in depth, and have on the side near the middle one small hole, as for passing a needle, and be of bronze, smooth on the front so that it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and have in the middle a cross-piece of bronze or iron, for putting a lit candle, and let there be large and small ones according to the illnesses and the age of those who take them;
For the cupping glasses of children are different from those of the old, and of the thin from the fat.
And one should thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
Take the candle of wax or ointment, and place it in the middle of the cupping glass through the rod that is in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping glass and it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the opening we have spoken of, so that when one wishes, the vapor will go out, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the ointment as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass, then, which is administered in a pleurisy, acute, there is no rod nor opening, and it is administered only when it is full of water, and is placed only on the limb;
and this is the form:
Leeches are administered only on limbs where one cannot put cupping glasses due to their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places bare of flesh, such as the ear or nose, and other similar ones;
and the quality of using them is that when you find leeches that are in clear, fresh, uninjured water, take them;
and put them in fresh water for a while, until they are full, and have nothing in their stomachs; and then be bled from the vein and cupped, then rub the limb until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can put a cupping glass, then put it, for this is very helpful.
If not, then wash the area with warm water, and then dry it well;
and if the area heals too quickly after the leeches, then soak a linen cloth in cold water and apply it, until the blood is dispersed.
and if the blood is multiplied, then apply ground vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it is dispersed.
or you place half of peeled beans on the area, and let them remain until they become hot on the area, this will now stop it.
and if you need more, then take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to adhere, then rub the area with fresh blood, or you stick a needle into it until blood comes out, and then put them on, and as soon as they sense the blood, they adhere.
and when you want them to fall off, then sprinkle a little ground aloes and salt, or ash, on them, and they will fall off now.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that fools scorn this chapter, because they never saw any of the ancient books, nor read any letter in them;
and for this reason, the science is estranged in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing, except through the science of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have dealt with the science, and by experience, and by the custom of my life;
and I have described in this chapter what is contained, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, just as I did in these two chapters before.
Therefore, it is necessary that we say in the prologue of this book the summaries of the words and the chapters where the wise man applies his understanding, and remains in the truth, so that those who have experience may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a break or dislocation or twisting or fracture happens to anyone, you must quickly bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of the body, or children, or the elderly; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and avoid cold foods, that is to say cold meats, and the flesh of birds and young deer, and drink no wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not fill up too much on foods that fill the veins with blood, lest you fear a hot abscess or the spreading of matter in the limb;
then the patient return to his first prior treatment that he has used.
And when the broken bone begins to recover, it is necessary to feed the patient foods that cause substantial nourishment, or that have viscosity, such as cooked wheat in water, and rice, and soups, and calves' feet and paunches, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment the breaking heals more quickly and more easily.
And know that broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot recover or mend well according to their nature due to the dryness of their limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
But there is a cure, to reset the broken bone with strong bandages that hold and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and not the slightest bit of his work, and therefore he must be nourished with hearty foods, as we have said.
And know that breaks are diverse in many ways.
For a break of the head is different from a break of the arm or the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of breaks. For there are breaks that go inwards and others that go outwards, like the edge of a writing feather.
For there are breaks that go inwards and others that go outwards, like the edge of a writing feather. And there are breaks with wounds, and breaks with only a small crack.
And for each manner there is its own tool and instrument for restoration, according to that which brings the remembrance to its place;
And a broken bone is known by the fact that the place is twisted, and clearly apparent by looking at it, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting nor sound on touching, and the patient does not feel much pain, there is no fracture;
but there may well be twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. Therefore you must not move it by hand, but apply the medicines which will come after, and then gently hold it steady.
And know that a fracture which extends to the joint, and the two parts are separated, they must now be put in equal alignment, lest pus come.
and if pus comes, then leave it for a few days until the pus is calmed;
then align it gently and skillfully, and know that the restoration of a fracture with less damage is easier than that of a fractured limb with fragments.
then hold it steady, as it is appropriate to do next.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, if it is in the hand or foot, or in your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you carefully return the parts to their places as much as you can, and be careful that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and properly join the two ends of the bone according to the best forms.
And feel it carefully with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well:
if you straighten it beautifully, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do whose work causes hot abscesses and contractions in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is in place, you must carefully instruct the patient not to move it, neither when waking nor sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other way; and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when he feels no pain, it is not yet properly set, and it must be put into such a position that he feels no pain;
and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when he feels no pain, it is not yet properly set, and it must be put into such a position that he feels no pain; and be careful that it is placed straight, so that no twisting comes when it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I have told you.
Know that broken limbs vary in size, and in shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar things: so it is necessary to wrap soft and thin linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thighs and legs:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and hard bandage, for wide bandages encompass the entire large limb, and bind it equally from all sides, so that there is no imperfection;
then bind around light dressings, three or four turns according to the limb, and slightly tighten your hand on the entire bandage, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture is slightly apart;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and wrap it around the fractured area again;
then return to the part below the fracture, and tighten it moderately, neither too tightly nor too loosely, as we have said in the first bandage above;
then place linen dressings or cloths between the bandages, until it is all even, then bandage everything over the bandage, and then place your well-made splints on top, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then place something soothing for abscesses, hot, and that removes the swelling, and leave it like this for some days;
then bind over your splints, and let them be half the width of a skilfully cut cane, or of wood from which cleaves are made, or of palm fronds, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint placed over the fracture be a little larger and wider than the others;
and be also as long as necessary for the limb's size or smallness; then bind over the splints as you did to the first bandage, then tie over it a thread, evenly, as in the first bandage over the fracture; tighter on top, gradually less;
and the threads should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, like the works of fools who make their bandages from twisted linen cords, and that is great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not necessary for there to be less than a finger's breadth of space between each splint.
And if the patient is wounded by the edges of the splints after the tightening in healthy areas, then place under them linen or wool wadding, so that he is not hurt.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all fractured limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to put splints on it strongly until after 5 or 7 days, or more, according to your certainty of a hot abscess arising.
And see here the method of ancient plasters for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twisting.
And it is that you take flour that sits by the mill walls, and mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common way of plaster to restore a fracture in many situations, especially for women and young children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twisting: Take 3 parts of abareis and ladani and enule and asefetide and gum arabic and mugat, each 10 parts. Myrrh and aloes, each 5 parts. Alechil 8 parts. And make it into powder, and mix it with the white of an egg. If the man's complexion is hot, then use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and restores broken bones quickly, and is of value to many men.
Another type of plaster that is good for sprains: Take mugwort and yarrow, each 10 parts. Myrrh and aloes, each 9 parts. Acacia 6 parts. Armenian bole 10 parts, and grind well, and mix with water or abundant egg white, and administer.
Another manner of plaster for joints and for bones separated from their places, and it soothes the pain arising, and the bone's cutting, and the fracture: Take new wool, and soak it in warm oil and cooked oil, and put it on the place.
These plasters do not restore, but they are good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly remove the pains.
Another manner of plaster which restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves, and leaves of ground ivy, and grind together, and make a plaster.
Another manner of plaster for the restoration of bone fracture and for lessening the remaining abscess. Take root of mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and flour of vetch, of each one part;
and grind, and bind with wine, and if the limb is heated, then bind with moist coriander water, or water, and use it.
Another manner of a stronger plaster than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take roots of mallow, and flax seed, balm, melilot, and yarrow, and violet flowers and chamomile, of all an equal part; and grind, and bind with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not place on a fractured limb for restoration anything but a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and he says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a broken limb, for restoring it, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and chopped human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and equal amounts of flax, and grind them, and make a plaster and apply it.
And then remove it a little later, and watch to see if the patient feels no pain, and that the bone hasn't moved from its place. If not, do not remove it for several days. And if pain comes to the place, or itching, lack of rest, or swelling, then hurry, and remove it, and take the plaster away immediately.
and take light cloths, and a wet sea sponge, and dip it in water, and apply it to the place, until the itching stops, and the pain is calmed. Then let the limb rest for an hour, then put dry wool, soaked in water or rose oil, on top, and bind it for a night, until you are sure there is no hot abscess.
and the inflammation of the limb will rest, and the pain will be gone, then resume the subtle bandage, and a small amount of plaster, and do not bind it so tightly as before; and bind it subtly until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling have all gone away, and you need plaster and a bandage, then start again, just as you did at first.
And if nothing of what we have said happens to the limb, do not unbind it for less than three or four or five or seven days. and sometimes leave it for twenty days, according to what one sees, until the fracture heals and the flesh comes together.
Then restrict it more than before, and increase its nourishment, as I said before;
and if you see the area drying out more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there. Therefore apply warm water frequently, every third day, and loosen the bandage a little.
By this work, then, nourishment flows to the limb, and quickly corrects the mistakes of foolish surgeons who restore the limb crookedly.
That is bad, and it is a fearful practice, and I see no other remedy than to leave it alone and work correctly.
Many kinds of fractures exist, with various shapes, and the causes are diverse.
For there are fractures caused by the impact of a sword, and the collarbone breaks all the bone down to the surface beneath the bone, just as a stick or a shaft does. And for that reason, this type of fracture is called a "haichure.
Where the sword cuts the bone from above in a piercing manner, and this type of fracture is called "absolute.
And the wound from these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a penetrating impact, or a fissure or a blow from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which approaches the tissue beneath the bone, or is upon the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound that penetrates the bone as thinly as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary.
and if the wound is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and causes a piece of bone to move inward, and the place is splintered as when blacksmiths strike on cauldrons; if between the stones inside.
And this happens more to those who have moist bones in the head, such as a child's head;
and happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated, like splinters; and I will speak on its place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the pulling on them, and the examination with probes, and by the corrupt flesh on top.
The similar capillary is recognized by this, that when one has uncovered the bone, and one rubs on it, the fractured blackness appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, beware of the patient's accidents, and if you see any bad accident, such as vomiting, and loss of understanding, and extension, and fainting, and acute fever, and the eyes appearing to be strained and reddened, and other similar things in many cases, then it cannot heal without a doubt.
And if you do not see a frightening accident, and you hope for healing, then begin the cure.
And when the injured person comes to you first, and it is in winter, you must remove the bone before the fourteenth day, at the time that you are able.
And if it is in summer, hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue beneath the bone is corrupted, and the accidents that we have mentioned come.
And if the fracture of the bone comes up to the tissue that covers the brain, you must split the broken part like this:
and you should take the head of the injured person and uncover the bone in every way you can, and over the shape of the wound gently as you can, and if the discharge of blood comes from uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help with what is necessary, and you should fill the space with cloths soaked in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and be sure of the discharge of blood; then begin to remove the bone, and it is done according to two methods of work:
One method is that you cut at the narrow cut in front, and this is the form:
And then you make another cut larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of various cuts, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and made of hard iron;
and work gently, so you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is hard and tough, you must pierce around it, before you administer cuts with drills, not so deep that they pierce through the skull bone, and there should be a margin or circle above the point, which does not allow the point to pass through the bone;
and you must have several, so that each one fits into its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all skulls;
and this is the form of the three types of drills:
The quality for piercing around the broken bone is that you place a drill on the bone, and turn with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then return the drill to another place a little after, and thus do around it all, then cut with the chisels the space of the bone that is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you draw out the bone with your hand, or with any of the instruments that you have, such as tongs, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the surface.
And when you have pierced and extracted the bone, it is necessary that you remove the remaining fragments of the bone with any other instrument similar to a chisel, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other chisel;
and if anything of the small bones or any scales remain, remove them lightly with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with ointments and dressings as we have described.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen describes, which is safer; and it is very strong, and that is his statement. First, you must expose a portion of the bone, where the fracture is apparent; so that once you have exposed that portion, you will place beneath the head of this incisor, lenticular, of which this is the shape:
And do not cut from one side only, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet on top, so that you gently cut the bone all around, and take good care of the cloth that is underneath;
if it is adhered to the bone, then remove it gently, for it is removed well without harm and without fear.
And if the bone fracture does not pierce through to the cloth, and the bone is cut only on the surface, and there are small pieces, then you must remove the roughness, and remove the scales with a fine rasp, of which you should have various sizes, in order to fit each place, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
If you begin with large rasps, and then with finer ones, and do not cease until it is well.
In each of the other cuts and subtle fractures, you must apply a treatment according to its direction;
and this is something not easily understood by one who has not devoted study to this art.
And if the surface is exposed, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth doubled in two or three, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so you do not burden the surface, then apply another bandage, and do not bind it too tightly, only enough to hold the wound;
and leave it thus for one or two days, until the inflamed abscess is calmed, then remove it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and make a powder of these things, and place it on the wound, and apply more medicines that are harmless without causing any pain;
and be sure that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave the ointment there, nor allow pus to collect, because when pus gathers on the brain membrane, it will spread and fester, and cause the patient great harm;
For when one puts something caustic on the surface, it will burn from above. Beware therefore, if any bad accident comes to the patient, as we have said, it is certainly dangerous.
And if blackening comes forth only because of the medicine applied, such that it has such a quality, you must take one part of honey, and three parts of rose oil and make a plaster of it, and put it on the surface; then treat it with the appropriate methods, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both parts of the nose above are broken, or only one, for these are two bones;
and the one underneath is cartilaginous, and does not break, but only bruises or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must put your little finger in the nostril, and align the fracture with your index finger and the thumb to the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and beware that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, you must align it with the head of a small, somewhat thick stick.
And if the fracture is from two parts, do the same again, and hurry to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess is calmed, then attach strips of linen to the head of the nose, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you place one on the other side, if the fracture is there; and let the strips be so large that they fill the holes of the nose.
And some restorers say that one should moisten the strips in butter and change them every day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they should be moistened in a mixture of egg white and mill powder; then leave the strip until the bone is hard and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes one puts goose feathers in the nose in place of strips, and a soft bandage is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held still, and the patient blows through it; or do whatever you wish.
And if a boil comes to the nose while you are working on it, put cerote or moistened cotton in rose oil, or a little bit of diachylon.
And if a boil does not come, put a plaster on the outside, made of millet flour and incense powder, mixed with a little egg white, then put on some light bandages, and do not bandage the nose;
and if the nasal fracture is small, and it is broken into small pieces, remove it with suitable instruments, then suture the fracture, and treat it with things that heal flesh, and with mending, such as suitable plasters and ointments;
and if there is no wound in the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead strips on it, until it is healed.
When the jaw is fractured from below, and there is no open wound, and the fracture is only superficial, and is not broken in two, except for the slight bending inwards, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger into the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is on the left jaw, place your index finger of your right hand, and gently insert the fracture inwards, and align it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the jaw fracture is broken in two, you must apply extension to both parts, until they are equal.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or rupture, tie them with a gold, silver or silk thread, then place a plaster on the fractured jaw, and put a double cloth over it; and place a large, well-made splint, or a piece of equal-sized leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape is changing, untie it on the third day, and then adjust what has changed. and apply a plaster of mill powder with plenty of egg or chickpea flour, after you have removed the plaster;
and place light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster heals, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until he is healed; Many times he is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses come, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and a wound together, examine if any piece of the bone has been removed; if subtle by removing with suitable instruments for that.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with fire according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, stitch the wound, if it is wide, and put suitable plasters for that on it, to encourage the flesh to grow, until it is healed.
The forceps break many times before, towards the shoulder, and the breakage is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
where there is breakage with a wound.
And the work is like this when the breakage is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken forceps; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then put the breakage even with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor end.
And if you need to extend further, then place a round sphere of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and it should be thick according to your need; and extend and lift the forceps, and hold the sphere in your hand, so that you put the breakage even, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the forceps out, because it is deep inside, then it is necessary for the patient to lie often on their back, and place a moderate pillow under the shoulder, and let the minister push the shoulder down, until the bone of the forceps is raised.
And then straighten the breakage with your fingers, and if you find it broken, you must split it open.
and gently pull the pieces apart, and if the bone cannot join together due to any obstacle, then cut it with one of the scalpels you have; but that you place this instrument under the forceps, to protect it from damage:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the strength of the work;
and have two heads, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the rupture of the wound you made when you pulled the bones;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, then cauterize the wound, and if the rupture is small, or you doubt a hot abscess, then fill the wound with bandages and tents, according to its quantity.
And if a hot abscess comes, then soak the bandages in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply them.
The tightening of the bone, when there are no wounds or cuts, is that you put on the bone the plaster of mill dust and egg white, and put light wads on top, and put a splint under the arm, if you need it; Then take a very wide bandage, a palm in width, then put a double bandage over the wads and the plaster; Then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage hangs down; and place the splint over the fracture, and turn the bandage over the shoulder, and under the healthy armpit, and under the diseased armpit; and bind it from each part, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the splint does not move from above the broken bone, then check it every day, and when the bandage loosens, tighten it;
and have the patient lie on their back, and place a small pillow under the armpit when they sleep, to raise the shoulder; this will lessen the fracture's pressure by raising the shoulder, or you tie the arm to the neck, and do not untie it unless an adverse event occurs, for up to 20 days;
then reapply the plaster if you see it needs it, and tighten and leave it thus, until it is restored;
and it is restored in at most 28 days, and in less time in some men.
of the fracture of the shoulder
Sometimes the shoulder breaks in a wide area or in the middle, and one doesn't know it is broken except by touching it;
if you align it according to the shape of the break, and reposition it according to its natural form, in every way you can;
then place on the area flour from the mill with plenty of egg, and light bandages, and place over it a double cloth; then place over it a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if there are gaps beneath the splint on any part of the shoulder, fill those gaps with flax bandages, so that the splint lies evenly;
and then bind it tightly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day;
and every time it softens, bind it, and make the splint even if it has shifted from its place, and let the patient lie on their side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this number is complete, unbind it, and be sure, for it is not a bone that moves easily out of place.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes forward and is underneath the skin, cut it open, remove it, and do what we have said in the treatment of a painful abscess.
of the fractured breast.
The breast is sometimes fractured in the middle, but this happens rarely. But it often breaks at the edge.
And when it is fractured in the middle, it inclines downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and a lack of breath, and nausea, and perhaps vomits blood, and the splinters show in the broken bone, and one can feel them well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on their back, and you put a cushion between their shoulders, then press the shoulders, and bring the ribs of the two ribs together with your hands, and carefully try to align them in all ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put plasters and bandages over the finest layer of salt, or another light material, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and wrap the bandage around the back, and tighten it properly, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, then tighten it;
and if it needs to be untied, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the area, or pain or an abscess, then hurry and untie it, and remove the plaster, and treat whatever has happened there with the appropriate treatments;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs usually happens only in the thick parts behind the back, and at the top of the chest, and they only bend because they are brittle; and one feels it well by examining the sides.
And the restoration is that you put the fracture in line, as is necessary. And then apply a plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need one.
And if the fracture of the ribs is inward, the patient feels very great pain and piercing, as if from pricking, because the bone pierces the tissue; and breathes in fits, and coughs and vomits great quantities of blood, and it is a serious illness, and the ancients have devoted great efforts to it.
And some say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest a hot abscess come about if it has not already. And if it has come, then treat it.
And some of you say that one should place cupping glasses on the site, to draw out strongly, and that seems reasonable. However, there is doubt that the cupping glass will draw the superfluities to the spot because of the weakness of its disposition.
And some of you say that one should cover the spot with wool soaked in hot oil, and one places tents between the ribs to place a bandage around it, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, food, and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear because of the bone piercing the flesh, and doubt exists in the patient, then it is necessary to cut into the place of the broken rib, and it is necessary to put something underneath the instrument to protect the surface.
and then one must cut the bone, and draw it out gently, and then stitch the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come, then place damp cloths in rose oil on the spot.
and treat the spot as is appropriate for the abscess, and let him lie often on the side where it should be, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you wish to know if they will be healed or not, be watchful if you see their hands softened and swollen and lifeless, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it.
Know that it is mortal in many conditions, and if they move and feel well when they are squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured if a cure is applied.
And if similar things happen to the spine of the back, and you wish to know if they will be healed or not, be watchful if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are present as in the hands, and above the back there is windiness and expulsion without volition;
and when one turns it over on its stomach, there is also expulsion without volition. And when it is turned over on its back and it wants to sit up, it cannot. Know that it is mortal: so do not labor in its cure.
And if these accidents do not come to him, then the thing is less severe.
And the cure is that if there is a hot abscess, you apply rose oil or egg oil until it is calmed;
then apply a comforting and drying plaster, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the part where he feels pain until it is healed.
And if any bone separates, it is necessary to cut on the heart; and remove the bone, then join the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a stitch, then treat it with a healing ointment until it is healed;
and if the bone head is broken, which is called the "head of the thigh," place your left hand on it, and try to align it with your other hand as best you can, then apply a plaster and bandage, if you need it;
then bind it tightly, and if any bone is separated, it should be cut open, and the bone removed, and the wound treated until it is healed.
of the fracture of the hip bone
Sometimes the hip bone is broken, and if it happens, there is little reduction at the head; and it breaks lengthwise, and deviates inward, and the patient experiences pain at the site, and a prickling sensation, and the broken part swells.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, so that you are over the fracture; and know what is the fracture and the shape of it;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then place the fracture equal, so that it is in the natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it declines inward, then have the patient lie on their stomach, so that the restoration of that fracture may be prepared for you. And when you have placed it equal, then put on the poultice, then put on a splint of wood or of leather, and bind the fracture, so that it does not move;
and fill the space beneath the ribs, so that the limb is equal. And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess comes there, do not touch it until the hot abscess is calmed, and put on that which we have previously said; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as necessary, if there is no bad accident;
of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the rib and the head of the shoulder, and if it is fractured, it should be restored according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape:
And tie two ends to two points, and hang them upwards, and let the patient sit on a chair;
then place the broken arm on the wood, so that it reaches the armpit, and put a bend of wood in the middle, then hang it on some heavy object or let the attendant extend it downwards;
then let the attendant align the fracture with the hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And another method is that one supports the patient on a stretcher, and ties the hand to his neck, then instructs two attendants to hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and the other below, all the way to the knot, and each extends to his part.
And if you wish the extraction to be stronger, then tighten one knot below the fracture, and one above the fracture, and each of the attendants extends to his side.
And if the fracture is near the shoulder blade, then you must place one knot below the armpit, and another towards the ribs, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the ribs, then one knot should be lightly placed, without effort, until the fracture is aligned over the place, and over the ribs;
then align the fracture as necessary, and hold it tight, if a swollen abscess does not form there.
And if a swollen abscess does form there, do not tighten it for seven days, and place moist wool in a sling and rose oil, until the swollen abscess has subsided;
then tighten it, and the manner of tightening it is that you place the plaster over the fracture, then assemble the arm over the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the chest;
and place the bandage, and tighten it over the shoulder, and over the arm, so that the arm is in its proper position, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not dislodged.
And if you doubt that the bone will move, use splints, and place over the fracture a splint wider and stronger than the others, and have one finger's width of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it extends three fingers' width beyond the fracture on each side;
then tighten over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter regarding the fracture, more tightly and less loosely as you go.
And if you see the placement of the splints and the tightening, as we have said, during the time that you are restoring the fractured limb, and you doubt a hot abscess, then leave it to be bound until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check the bandage every three days, that itching or swelling or infection do not occur in the area, or that the nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If it is straightened, as we have said.
And if no such accident occurs, then do not loosen it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on their back, and have their hands on their stomach;
and put under the shoulder one cushion full of wool equally, and watch every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the fractured limb does not move, or the bandages are not softened;
if it is straightened by the virtue of medicine, and give the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a manner that the food is initially subtle; and when it begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and leg should be recovered in forty days altogether; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and medicinal ointments to straighten the place.
And if the constriction is bad and swollen, it should remain unbound for 10 days or 2 months.
of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the "ulna" and the "radius"; of which one is smaller, and that is the one that touches the thumb.
and the other is large, and it is the one that is underneath, near the little finger.
Perhaps only the large bone is broken, or the small one, or perhaps both together.
When the smaller bone is broken, the restoration is easier, and the healing.
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and worse than when they are both broken together.
If it is only the small bone that is broken, it must be slightly stretched and placed straight.
And if it is the large bone, it must be tightened more strongly;
and stretch it over a cushion, and hold the thumb higher than the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient lie crossed over himself, and the cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient suffers no exertion;
Then the minister stretches his arm to the part under his hand, or to a strap, and another minister to the other above.
And then the physician should place it straight, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture it is broken into pieces, then place each in its place, and if there is any detached one that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it open and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter. Then take the cure.
And if in the beginning of the restoration hot abscesses arise, then apply a bandage of plaster made of rose oil and white wax, neither too hard nor too soft. and bind the bandage subtly over it until the hot abscess is calmed.
And then remove the plaster, and put on the poultice of the mill's powder with plenty of egg, then put on the splints, and the splint for the fracture should be stronger, and a little wider than the others.
and know that there should be six splints for the arm in several positions: whether the fracture is in one bone, or in two;
and bind more tightly over the fracture than elsewhere, and gradually less as it heals, as I have said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard nor rough;
and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard nor rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And watch the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any bad accident comes to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must wash the limb with hot water, until the itching is calmed;
and let the limb rest neither too tight nor too loose.
And then resume the tightening, and if the bandage is softened and the bone separated, or similar things, then readjust it.
And be wary if nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it thus for a few days, until nourishment runs to it, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, do not loosen it until twenty days.
or, in the meantime, let him hang his hands around his neck, and let his shoulders be equal, and guard against movement and handling, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is restored in thirty or thirty-five days, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of the virtues.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and the ends of the fingers, few fractures occur, and only bending happens many times.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, the patient should sit cross-legged, and sit straight in front of himself equally;
then place his hand on a flat surface, and let the attendant extend the broken bones, and align them properly, so that they are well joined;
and apply the plaster and bandages, if no abscess forms, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and wrap it in a linen bandage.
And if the fracture is within the sole of the foot, make a ball of bandages, and instruct the patient to hold it against their broken foot; and then bind it with a long bandage, and let the splint be made of soft material, as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you should place a splint on top, and another underneath on the sole, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it completely around the hand, and close the bandage between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the knuckle, put it in alignment as necessary; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small, straight splint to raise the fracture, and do not move it;
and if the fracture is in other fingers, such as the index or one of the others, put it in alignment, and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or you bind them all together in a line, that is what is best, or you place a splint on it, as on the knuckle;
and be careful in the restoration and arrangement of a hot abscess, and help what comes from it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and one can clearly see it when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is done by binding one bandage above the break, and another below. And the patient lies on their face, then each attendant extends their bandage equally on their side;
and that's when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is close to the root of the thigh, then one bandage should be towards the groin, and the other bandage below the break.
And likewise, if it is close to the knee, then the bandage should be next to the knee, and the extension should be downwards;
then the attendant should place the bone straight with their two hands, so that it is in its natural shape, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscesses occur there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside then return to your work and your treatment; The binding is done in this manner.
You must wrap around the fracture with one hard bandage doubled in two or three, and leave the excess, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and place one long thread between the thigh and leg, below the knee, and the thread ends above;
then turn the bandage around the leg and thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to make the constriction even, then begin to tightly bind three or four turns over the fracture; and as you go further up from the fracture, bind less tightly;
then tie the two ends of the thread you placed between the leg and thigh, and bind the three splints that are above, then return below to the end of the thread, until you come beside the foot;
and bind it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like this, so that there comes neither abscess nor swelling nor other such thing. And if it happens, untie it, and correct what comes, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of the bone that are protruding, it must be extracted, if one can; and if one cannot, it is necessary to split the place and pull it forcefully; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken in such a way that splints are placed in it, as in the shoulder and in the arm;
However, with such restoration, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in seven days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversity of the complexions.
Know that in the joint of the knee there is little fracture, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and occurs in all wounds, with or without a wound, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is done by putting together the parts that are broken at their ends, until they are joined as much as possible.
Then apply the plaster, and put a round splint, if necessary, and bind it as required, then observe all the treatments we have described for other fractures, such as hot abscesses and similar conditions. So apply the appropriate treatment for each condition until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that the leg has two bones, one called the "tibia", and the other called the "fibula".
And every type of fracture occurs as it does in the arm, and for this reason, the restoration is similar to that of the arm, and the treatment is the same.  And if the two bones are broken together, the leg turns out of place in all directions.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the thick bone is broken, one feels great pain, and it is clearly visible. and turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and put it straight, and bind the splints similarly;
However, if the fracture is severe, and there are several pieces, the extension should be gentler and lighter; and treat it according to your skill.
And when you have completed all your work, take two bundles of wooden splints that support the leg on either side, and are the length of the leg from the knee downwards;
then wrap the two splints with one bandage over and under, and tie it in the middle as well; with this bandage the leg will not deviate to the right or left, and thus it is well;
and some use one splint the length of the leg, of wood, and place the leg on it to prevent movement; this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or another accident. if treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but sometimes there is a fracture in the bones of the foot and toes, and there is only a crack in several positions.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, have the patient place their foot on the ground, as if they were going to walk, then immediately place your foot on theirs, over where the bones are raised, and press it until they return to their places.
Then place a plaster and bandages over it, and put a small board under the sole of the foot, two inches wide, then bind it to the foot firmly, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones aligned, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, realign them, as we have said for the fingers of the hand. Then place a splint along the length of the broken toe, slightly wider, then place the board I mentioned under the foot, and bind it firmly.
And if there are two or three, or more, broken toes, place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot. And let it rest on the top of the board, away from the sole of the foot, so that it holds it firmly.
And you must not forget the other things I have said about other fractures, as we have already stated. And treat each injury as appropriate.
of the fracture of the bone of the finger.
When the bone of a woman's nature is fractured, place her seated with her legs spread, then incline her towards her back, and hold her from behind.
Then the attendant should fill the patient's natural area with cotton, and put in as much as will fit.
Then raise the woman up, lifting her back slowly, and the cotton will then rise until it reaches the entrance of the natural passage, and the bone will return with the cotton.
And when she wishes to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and do this for seven days or so. Then the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a string to the opening, and put the entire bladder into the natural passage. Then blow into the string forcefully, until the bladder is filled inside. The fracture will return to its place.
Then fill it with cotton and leave it thus for several days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's or woman's finger is fractured, restore it as we have described for the hip bone.
And these fractures, close by to those who apply themselves to study and use, and understand my book, are not hidden.
For the fracture signifies, in several dispositions, the right path to restoration: Understand it then.
In the finger, when it is fractured, take a goose's throat and apply it to the finger; then wrap it in cloths, and leave it three days or so wrapped, and it will be healed quickly.
of fracture with wound
It is necessary for someone with a fracture and a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder or similar, that he be healed promptly, so that the bleedings we have described bear witness to it.
And if the wound heals, stop the bleeding with vitriol, if you have no other thing, and then resume restoring the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if a hot abscess does not develop.
And if a hot abscess develops, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a bad accident.
And if the broken bone is visible on the exposed flesh, it is necessary that you put it in place gently with your hands, with a small extension.
And if the extension is not suitable for placing it equal with your hands, then reposition it with this instrument that is of iron, which has seven or eight fingers in length, and its width is according to the extent of the wound; and for this, the surgeon needs three or four, according to what he needs in each fracture treatment;
and let them be round and somewhat thick, so that they do not bend at all when compressing the limb during your work, and be pointed in front, and thick from the middle onwards, like this:
And it is called "palanche," because it is necessary that the curved part be placed over the exposed end of the bone; and push it all at once, so that it returns to place, and the parts are equal to one another. And if the fracture is slight, and the instrument cannot properly grip the bone, you must cut the end of the bone, so that the instrument has purchase.
And if you cannot return the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument for this, either a sharp or a saw, to the best of your ability;
then remove that which remains in the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is returned, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
So do so until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in dark astringent wine, and properly if it is in that condition; and do not put any plaster or other oily substance on the wound, lest it cause rot and corruption;
then apply splints once you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering completely around it, according to the size of the wound, and carefully ensure that the wound is not constricted by the fracture;
and many times foolish healers have done this, and have caused either death or sores in the patient; and let the constriction be gentler and softer than other fractures.
And if the wound is large or severe, and you fear that bad outcomes may occur, as we have said, and you find pain at the site, then you should not put splints on it; but wrap around it, instead of splints, hard cloths, and tie them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming on the wound, then remove what you have put on it completely, and put on healing ointment for wounds, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is necessary that you loosen the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And the limb must be positioned in such a way that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass and it cannot heal but keeps returning to pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, therefore you must probe the wound with a tent, and remove all those separated pieces that cause this pain.
And if a fistula forms at the place, or another manner of corruption, then you must treat it, according to what he says in his chapter before this.
And when the bone is broken and exposed on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and other similar large limbs, do not pull it out, for many times death results, but leave it until it rots.
Perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can.
and if you cannot, leave it.
We are often visited by bruises after the injury to the break, especially when it is near the joint, and a pitiful sight is the appearance of the limb. and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Beware then if the wound is fresh. if he administers astringent medicines, such as aloes, frankincense, and myrrh, and gum tragacanth, acacia, and similar others, then you should take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with astringent wine or with egg white or with oil; and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not unbind it for many days;
and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not unbind it for many days; and then loosen it, and begin another, until the swelling is gone;
or you bind it over a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is such that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the swelling has already hardened like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut above it and remove the excess; or you scrape it with a razor until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after the healing
When the broken bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and fragile afterward, it happens due to many causes: one of which is because it was bound too tightly and not bound properly; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or due to excessive watering; or due to excessively large movements, and not at the correct time; or because he has little blood in his body, and is weak.
And the treatment is that you should make the patient eat, and make the body tender, until the blood is multiplied within him; and give him baths, and provide him with joy and ease;
then apply pitch to the limb, so that the pitch attracts great nourishment, and often wet it with warm water, so that the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
a limb twisted after sickness When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is exposed, and the shape of the limb is unsightly, nevertheless it does not entirely lose its natural function:
so do not believe the foolish who say that one should break the limb anew, and many foolish men have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm results, and perhaps death;
However, if the knots and torments are fresh, they should be soaked in hot water, or softening herbs be boiled, such as figwort leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon, and take the juice of figwort, and mix it with goose fat or sesame oil, and make a poultice over it;
or take ripe figs, and crush them with flaxseed meal, and similar medicines that lessen the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with wet hands. And movement should be given to the limb every hour.
And if the deformity is old and hardened, like stone, and removal with iron is needed, it should be cut down to the bone, with a fine, light incision; and apply dressings and attention to the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, so that it cannot move, and the limb is misaligned, causing the patient great pain and injury.
When dislocation occurs to someone, it must be immediately brought back into place without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it is difficult to return it to its place.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to move it when it is swollen. Many times it causes spasm and other pains.
However, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave him until the abscesses are quieted.
Then anoint the limb with hot water and oil, then gently reposition it, and treat each limb as it returns to its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
Sometimes the jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways/methods. or they are slightly separated from their places, and softened a little; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and the saliva flows from the mouth that he cannot contain, nor can he close his mouth, and he wraps his tongue with the speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns through several positions/arrangements.
And if it is complete and accomplished, you must reset it quickly, and not delay.
and in such a way that the attendant holds the patient's head, and the assistant puts the tip of one of his hands into the root of the jaw dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is of two parts; and the other finger of the hand is set away, in order to put it equal/in line.
and instruct the patient to relax their jaw, and move it in every direction. And the assistant puts it in line, until it returns to its place.
And if the repositioning is difficult, especially if it's the two jaws together, then lubricate them with hot water and oil, so that you can reposition them gently;
and do not delay in repositioning, as we have said.
And when they are properly repositioned, and the patient's mouth closes well without resistance, then place damp cloths over it in a bandage made of rose oil and wax, then tie it lightly with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on their back, with their head supported between two cushions, so that they do not move it to either the right or the left, nor make any effort to open it, but let them eat light food, until the pain is gone, and the jaws are healed;
and then let them eat whatever they want lightly, and do not force the mouth open to eat and drink until the jaw is fully healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be put back in place at once, and are not restored to their proper positions, it results in accustomed fevers and aches, and perhaps bowel movements, and perhaps vomiting of pure phlegm.
And when you see this, then know that it is a loss. and many times those who experience this die within four days.
The fork cannot dislocate from the ribs within the continuation of it and the chest, and it is sometimes dislocated outward, and this is clearly felt.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on their back and extends their arms; and then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tightly;
and the shoulder which is towards the ribs cannot dislocate; if not, and if it dislocates occasionally, then reset it to its place, as we have said;
then apply the plaster and bandage, and bind it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and in the same way is the shoulder reset, when it is dislocated from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways:
one of which is that it dislocates to the side of the shoulder blade below; and the second is to the side of the breast; and perhaps it dislocates to the upper part, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind the shoulder, nor does it dislocate inward towards the nerves;
and many times it dislocates downwards towards the shoulder blade, especially in those with little flesh, for in them it jumps easily;
in those with ample flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And perhaps in some men, a blow or a fracture occurs, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they believe it is dislocated because of this.
Therefore you should test it, until you are certain. And then begin the treatment.
And dislocation is recognized when it is lower towards the armpit, and a difference is observed between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a clear difference between them. and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone. and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way.
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly when touching it.
and this type of dislocation is only to be reset, when it is new, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the minister lifts the patient's hand upward, then places his palms under the armpit, and lifts the joint forcibly upward to its place. And the minister lifts the hand, and extends it upwards, then places it underneath. Then it will be well.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then the patient must be bathed in warm water; and the minister should administer a softening and soothing lotion, such as a decoction of mallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
Then the patient should be laid on their back, and a layer of even wool, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit; then the patient's heel should be placed on the wool, and the shoulder head should be raised firmly, and the patient's hand should be pulled;
and another minister should hold the patient's head so that it does not move down; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you want to see how to reposition it in this way:
and you should have a man present who is taller than the patient; and he should stand straight toward the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and raise the armpit upwards so that the patient hangs in the air; and another minister should pull the patient's arm down toward the belly. And if the patient is too light, then hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is reset also in another way:
and one should place a long piece of wood in the ground, whose head should be as wide as a pestle, and should be neither too thick nor too thin; then it should be placed under the patient, but let there be soft cloths on top, and the patient should be lying on the length of the pole;
then his hand should be stretched down on the other side forcefully, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not wish to return despite all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a piece of wood two arms long and four fingers wide, which has a rounded head so it can enter deeply under the armpit, according to this shape:
then tie soft cloths over the head of the pole, so that the pole does not hurt the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm over the long pole, and tie the shoulder over the pole, and the arm to the top of the hand, then place the arm over a rung of a ladder that is wide, and let the hand be stretched downwards, and let the body hang down on the other side: the joint returns now.
And when it is in, in whatever manner, you must put a sphere of wool beneath the armpit, then apply the prepared plaster of mill powder, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then bind under the armpit fittingly, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to his neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal sooner;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and it is not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is forced out of place by moisture that has come to it, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries to three points, as it is shown earlier in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it separates after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm upward, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder is cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations that are towards the breast, or the back, are caused by pushing and pulling of the hands, and another treatment is applied.
and treat until he is healed.
And if after healing, there is stiffness in the limb and delay in movement, the patient should use baths many times, until the stiffness is relieved and returns to its original nature.
of the dislocation of the rib
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated in spurts, and returns in spurts.
and it has dislocated on all sides, especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not hidden, for it is clearly seen and felt. and dislocates according to each shape. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can clearly see it. For the joint is twisted, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch the shoulder at all.
And you must reset it before any hot abscesses come, for if hot abscesses were to come, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be entirely reset, especially when it is in the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps death comes from it.
And the restoration, when it is such that it can be reset, is that you stretch its hand with your two hands; and its arms be spread out, and the hands from the mirror according to the knife around, above and below, and put the joint to its shoulders together, or to the root of its palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when it doubles its hand to its hand, and strikes from the root of the palm with the knife that is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, then administer strong extension;
and it is that two ministers extend the arm, and hold it two ministers, so that it does not move with the extension;
then turn the arm each way, after you have wrapped a double cloth long and wide;
and when the man places the joint to his hand, then anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then put the joint firmly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, then put on a dry plaster with a bit of egg, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm at the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then unbind the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint is not well tightened, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it thus for a few days, until it is firmly placed; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the joint is reset, and it moves, then bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or you place a layer of fat mutton on the joint, then leave it for one day and one night, then remove it, and put it in a bath; and when it sweats, rub the joint gently, then replace the layer and put it back in the bath; and do this two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, place warm, moist cow's hay with butter on top, and bind it on;
it will return to its position.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than other joints. However, it must be brought back to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place becomes swollen, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the repositioning is done by placing the diseased hand on a table, and the minister extends the hand, and the minister puts it straight, so that he puts his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
However, you must check if it is properly in place; then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table during the extension and repositioning. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, the patient should place the back of their hand on the table, and the minister should place their hand over that apparent joint.
If it returns now, that is good. If not, apply soothing poultices to the abscesses, and leave it like that without repeating.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put the joint back in place after several days, the joint remains twisted.
and it does not harm the patient any more than that the hand is softened, and cannot grasp anything at all: Then know that the nerve or artery is severed.
There is no other remedy but to cauterize nearby the case, and perhaps nothing else will work.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it thus.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, soak it in warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
Of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated in various directions, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly (palm side).
Then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your fingers until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then put it back in place that same day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it again at night;
and do this often, until it is strong, and likewise do this if it is dislocated on the palm side of the hand, and do as you did before, until it is healthy;
and likewise do this, when it is dislocated on the other side.
where dislocation of the shin from the back
When the shin from the back or the neck is dislocated, or there are several dislocated, there is no cure, for death hastens the patient.
And the signs are that the excretions jump out involuntarily, nor can he hold them, and many times some limb is softened, or both thighs or both arms or one.
And many times the shin moves in four directions;
that which moves to the back is called "gibbosity":
the cure is that you observe if the gibbosity came from childhood: if not, there is no cure nor healing at all.
And that which comes from falling or impacts or similar things, the ancient healers described cures in grand words, but there is not always great benefit in them;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the chest in front, there is no remedy nor health;
and also that which comes directly on the two sides, and one cannot cure those except properly that which comes to the back, as I say;
and that the patient be stretched out on his face in one even place, and have something to support under him, so he does not injure himself;
then place one burning stick in the ground firmly at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a bandage under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and knees, and ankles;
and two assistants should hold the bandages, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two burning sticks;
and be firmly held, the sticks as we have said, and the master should place his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns to its place.
And if it does not return with this treatment, take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and the patient should be on his side, and place the head of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the master place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with the turning device that turns in the hand. And you should place two sticks at the patient's head, one arm's length apart, and two others towards the feet, and have a palm's width of space between each stick, both above and below.
and have a hole in each stick, through which the turning device runs, and let the sticks be firmly planted in the ground so that they do not move.
and between each two sticks place one rotating stick, upon which the ropes turn, and have two small sticks of a palm's length on the two pivots to turn the turning device.
and then tie the rope that is among the ropes to the turning device towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other turning device, and each of the assistants turns their turning device around the entire rope, and the master puts the splinter straight as we have said.
And when it is straight, place a desiccant plaster with a lot of egg, then bandages, then a splint of a tablet three fingers long, that covers the place of the bump and the healthy part of the spine, then bind it with a bandage, as we have said, and the patient use light nourishment until he is healed.
And if any problem arises at the end of healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned earlier. And sometimes a piece of lead is administered, and sometimes an appearance arises in the lower spine of the back, and it is believed to be a dislocation. And it is the bone that appears, therefore there should be no presumption. Perhaps it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations occur, and not as at other joints.
And the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward elsewhere, and slightly dislocated forward and backward.
And the knowledge of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the sick leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the sick person's knee is more prominent than the healthy one's, and the sick person cannot bend their knee to the fire; and the place next to it is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which comes to the outward is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the signs of that which happens to the front are that he extends his leg well according to the completion; however, does not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make him walk, he cannot go forward, and he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when he walks, he passes over the heel.
And the signs of that which happens to the back are that he cannot spread his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The resetting of this type of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is old, and it remains according to its position, there is no cure; and there is no need for him to have presumption.
And in the one whose dislocation is fresh, and it is one of the four types of dislocation, hurry to turn the joint, and extend it inside and out, and move it to the right and left; Perhaps it will return, and no other cure is needed.
And if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg forcefully with two hands, or with a strap tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a manner that he places his hands under his armpits, then tightens it with a gentle strap on the thigh; and another holds the end of the strap;
and all pull upward and downward simultaneously, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains suspended.
This manner of extension is common to four similar cases, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is good.
If not, then treatment must be applied to its likeness.
When the dislocation is inside, you must have the patient lie on their healthy side, then place the strap on the root of the thigh, and the place beneath the armpit, then extend the strap upward towards the armpit, and toward the force.
then have other assistants take hold of his arms, and grip the large area of the diseased thigh, and pull it outward strongly: it will return to its place now;
and this manner of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot secure it in this manner we have described, you must tie the patient's two feet together with a strong soft strap over the two heels, and over the two knees, and have the diseased leg extended two spans more than the other;
then it should be hung over the head of a post, and be two arms' length above the ground;
then command one attendant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another attendant hang with the patient, embracing the thigh firmly, for the joint will return quickly now.
And when the dislocation is at the hip, the patient lies down, as we said for those with hip-joint disease, and one attendant tightens a strap over the diseased leg properly, and over the hip as well;
then place two pieces of wood, one at the head and the other at the feet, then place one piece of wood between the patient's thighs in the middle of the form; and let it be covered with damp cloths around so it does not injure the patient, then let each attendant pull towards him, and the one who watches should place the dislocation level with his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place it on a table and press it as we said for hip-joint disease, and the patient lies on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the sick leg forcefully, and according to what I have said; and let the watcher place his effort on the affected joint, then press with the other hand, and extend it downward toward the knee.
And if the dislocation is backward, it is not necessary to extend the patient downwards, or raise him up from the ground, but rather he should be positioned as if the hip were dislocated backward, as we said about lying on both hips; and be on his face, and the ligament extended as we said previously, and one must press on the joint to the table; and it will be in place when the patient extends his legs, and they are even; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are even, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and let it move gently, until the limb is strengthened.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inward and outward, and backward;
and it does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend their leg at the thigh, and if it does not fit against their thigh, know that it is dislocated;
And the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and place your back against their face, and put their foot on your feet;
then take their knee in your palms, and retract between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee firmly; and another attendant extends their foot, so that the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that their leg fits well against their thigh lightly;
and apply the plaster, and make the leg fit against the thigh, and bind them together firmly for three or four days, then unbind them;
and the patient does not work at all, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not completely healed, the attendant applies strong stretching, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healthy.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes moved, and sometimes dislocated completely, both inwards and outwards.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and bulges forward on the side where it is dislocated:
The reduction is gentle, and one should gently stretch it with one's hands when it is only moved.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and hold the leg firmly above the ankle with two assistants.
then pull the foot towards your right hand, and then to the left hand twice, then stretch it upwards, and gently place the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
if it returns, that is good;
if not, then recommence the work, for it will return;
and if it cannot return thus, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly place a post into the ground between their thighs, and tie straps around it so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the attendants hold the thigh, and other attendants extend the foot to their hands or to a rope, which they tie to the top of the foot; then let each attendant pull equally, and the post should be between the patient's thighs to hold the patient when they are being stretched;
then let the assistants hold the dislocation in their hands, and another attendant hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, put the plaster and bandages on, and bind it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves that are on the ankle behind, so that the bandages are not too tight;
then leave it two or three days, and if the bandage loosens, bind it tighter;
then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if a boil comes there, you must soothe it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without effort, and that is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any part of the back of the foot, you must have the patient sit on a flat surface or a table, perfectly upright, and place your foot on the exposed joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns.
And when it is aligned, and nothing shows, place a table with two supports under the sole of the foot, then hold it firmly, and leave it for three days, then release it. And keep it resting until it is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
So do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and you have not used it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, and not rash;
and use at first soothing things for the hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hand if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, then restore the limb to its place, so that the hot abscess may come to it;
And when the limb is in place, administer soothing things for the hot abscess, and treat the wound, as is appropriate, with drying ointments;
And if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then set them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
And guard yourself from entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for this will be a boon to you according to your Creator, and for the health of your arm and your body.
