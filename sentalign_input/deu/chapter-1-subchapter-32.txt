Chapter Thirty-Two:
On the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with yellow water, you should cauterize the feet on the top between the little toe and the ring toe, lift your hand with the cautery without twisting it; then lift your hand and do not completely return it, because the yellow water will discharge.
The cauterization is done in this way: make two cauterizations on both thighs, and on each thigh, the cauterization should be done with the tip of the knife-shaped cautery.
The cauterizations should be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh; and make two cauterizations on each thigh.
Leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some of the water can discharge from it.
Then treat it with the remedies we have mentioned.
