Chapter sixty-seven on the hernia that is in the groin.	CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN. On the treatment of the rupture that occurs in the groin.	0.7392664
A hernia may occur in the groin, as we have said, and the place swells, and nothing of the intestine descends to the testicles.	Sometimes there occurs a rupture in the groin as we have said, and the part protrudes.	0.55737233
And if it does descend, it is slight and returns at all times.	No portion of the intestine descends into the scrotum; or if anything it will be only a tiny portion and will reduce at any time.	0.40230784
But if time passes, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and omentum descend into the scrotum.	But if it goes on for a long time the rupture in the membrane increases until the bowel and omentum descend into the scrotum.	0.86712563
This occurs from the extension of the peritoneum that is in the groin, as we have said, and that is that the peritoneum extends, then relaxes, and the place swells and protrudes.	It arises from a stretching of the membrane in the groin, as we said; the membrane stretches and then relaxes and the place swells.	0.82525563
And its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.	Its treatment by the cautery is as I have already described.	0.8537866
It may also be treated with iron in this manner: The patient lies on his back between your hands, then you incise the place of the swollen hernia transversely to the extent of three fingers, then you pad the peritoneal layers that are under the skin until the white peritoneum that follows it is exposed, then you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two protruding places on the edge of the probe from the peritoneum and stick one to the other with the stitching.	Sometimes also it is treated with the knife in this manner: With the patient lying back before you, make an incision three fingers wide, transversely across the swelling of the rupture which projects. Then perforate the subcutaneous tissues so as to expose the white membrane that lies under the skin alongside the rupture. Take a probe and place it upon the projecting part of the fascia and push it back into the depths of the abdomen. Then sew together the two swollen portions of membrane over the end of the probe and suture the one to the other.	0.81168514
Then you pull the edge of the probe and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds. So when the threads are cut, you clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the protrusion of the hernia does not increase.	Then take out the probe. On no account make the incision into the fascia nor touch the testis nor anything else, as I taught you on the subject of treating the intestinal hernia. Then dress the wound, and when the stitches come apart remove them and bandage the wound again until it is healed over. For the membrane will draw together and the rupture will not come out again.	0.8549439
Cauterization is better in this place because it is closer to safety.	But the cautery is better at this spot, for it is safer.	0.75839496
