Of the dislocation of the knee	On dislocation of the knee.	0.76099944
The knee dislocates in three ways: namely, inwards, outwards, and backwards; and it does not dislocate forwards.	The knee is dislocated in three ways; it is dislocated interiorly and exteriorly and inferiorly, that is, posteriorly. It is never dislocated anteriorly.	0.9077471
And the sign is that you command the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not attach to his thigh, know that it is dislocated.	The sign of dislocation is to bid the patient flex his leg on his thigh, and if it does not reach the thigh you may know the knee is dislocated.	0.8174242
And the treatment for all is to have the patient sit up straight, and extend his leg if he can, and place your back against his face, and place his foot on your feet.	The way of setting all the types of dislocation is to make the patient sit down with both legs extended, if he can, with an assistant sitting behind him to hold him by the middle and incline him slightly backward.	0.6796198
Then take his knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then press the two sides of the knee firmly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he can bend his leg to his thigh easily.	Then do you yourself sit on his thighs with your back to his front, and put his leg between yours; then the palms of your hands should be applied to his knee, and join them together by twining the fingers; then with the palms put strong pressure on both sides of his knee while another assistant extends his foot until the knee goes back to its place. The sign of its return is that the leg can be flexed back easily and without hindrance upon the thigh.	0.88466966
And apply the plaster, and bind the leg to the thigh, and tie them together tightly for three or four days, then untie it; and do not let the patient walk until the limb is strengthened.	Then apply a plaster and flex the leg on to the thigh and bandage them together for three or four days; then loosen them. He should do little walking for some days until it gains strength.	0.8447996
And if the limb is not right, apply strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.	But if you cannot effect reduction by this method, apply powerful extension by bandages as we have described above for the treatment of the hip, until it goes back.	0.676584
