O you, very dear children, I have completed this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, together with its fullness, and have made the end by its expositions and by its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I complete it with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery.
And because the work of hands is very difficult in our region and is completely strange, the science is lost and cut off, and nothing remains of it powerful except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that hands have changed. And from this came the error and the vanity, and the intentions are closed and the science is estranged.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it, along with the ordering of this treatise, according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and will come along with the forms of cautery irons, and the other instruments of the work, with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is estranged. And whoever undertakes it must excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that they know the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and conjunctions and separations, and have knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and their number, and the movement and stillness of the veins and the places of their origin.
And therefore Hippocrates said that the name, with the name, is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of hands.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the previously mentioned things, let them be careful not to fall into error and kill people;
just as I have often seen many of those who undertake this science abandon themselves to theory and without experience.
For I saw a foolish surgeon who cut an abscess of scrophules on a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; so that so much blood flowed out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And saw another surgeon who extracted a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large; and carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and saw the patient's condition and the size of the stone, and knew well that if it was cut out, he would die.
And I saw another surgeon who treated the Duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break there was a wound;
and the surgeon, full of ignorance, squeezed the break over the wound with strong bandages, and did not leave the wound any slack, and left it thus for a time;
and told him not to loosen it at all;
and it remained like that until the leg, and the foot, became completely swollen and led to destruction.
I was called to come to him, and hurried to come and untie the leg; and when I loosened it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But in any case, the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb, and I could not cure it;
and the corruption continued to spread through the limb until the entire limb was lost.
And I saw another mire that crushed the infected abscess, and then inflamed by the malice of its lord.
For a chancre, when it is pure of melancholic humor, it is not necessary to touch it with iron unless it is in such a place that all that is corrupted can be removed.
And therefore, my dear son, you need to know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work in which there is danger in many dispositions;
and I will show in every place of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to be careful, so that foolish critics cannot speak ill of you.
So take your weapons in readiness, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best way so that through the grace of God you come to salvation and be praised;
and leave the terrible illnesses of grievous health;
and remove your weapons from that which causes you fear, and have faith in yourselves so that you may come from this world to the next with glory.
Galen said in some of his admonitions: Do not take on a serious illness as a cure, lest you be called a foolish physician.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is on cauteries by fire and cauteries by sharp medicine, and the chapter is arranged from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and the ironwork of cauteries, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is of cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and of similar things;
and the chapter is arranged and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is of restoring dislocations and twists, and of similar things;
and it is ordered from the head down to the feet, and of the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I say the quality of the aid and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the quality of the aid, and of the harm, is the longest discourse and subtle science and the secret answer;
and about this many wise men spoke, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear length.
I say that cautery helps universally in every complexion where there is matter, except two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a hot and dry complexion together with matter, some disagreed and said that cautery is great help; and others said the opposite: that cautery is not worthwhile for an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and should not be used to treat a hot illness with heat, or with dryness;
and the one who said the opposite said that cautery is of great help for hot and dry illnesses that come upon people's bodies. For when you compare a man's body and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it sometimes by experiment.
And nonetheless, do not interfere except those who have tested it, and who know through long use the chapter on cauteries, and the diversity of people's complexions, and their dispositions and the causes of their illnesses, and their occurrences and the passage of time;
Of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the doctors assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not affect anything except the limb that is afflicted, and harms no other limb, if at all.
Burning medicines move from one limb to another when applied, and cause severe illnesses in the limb affected; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not cause harm, unless there is an excess.
And this I have found through experience and the length of service and study I have put into the art, and it is based on the truth of things;
and for this, I apologize for the length of my words, for I do not wish to hide the secret contained within fire, and the nature of the work, how it expels illnesses from the body, just as the philosopher demonstrates; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauteries should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the resulting harm is overcome with the help of cautery; and especially if the cauteries are necessary for pain, urgently and quickly, before greater harm can befall the limb.
And never think about it, dear son, as fools do; for the illness cured by cautery has no return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not as they think, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion and dries the humours that are the cause of the pain, and it is better than other medicine for its speed, and for the power of its work and its mastery.
And a powerful thing it is that the illness sometimes comes according to the complexion of the ill person and the location of the illness and its power;
and if superfluities gather in him through the intake of food and similar things, unless cauteries are applied where there is little superfluity and moisture, like cauteries on teeth for pain, and similar things, then such pain does not return; but this happens little.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and that is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is effective after other treatments, but their intentions are false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for an illness and they are ineffective, then we administer the cautery, and it is effective.
Then it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intentions of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than one of iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the high quality of its substance;
and they said that the place of cautery does not cause decay, but this is not true, for I have proven it, and have found it to be true in some men;
and cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly;
and if one heats it too much; so do they do in the fire; and thus there is enough hindrance.
Or I have arranged this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way may be easier to find.
These cauteries are good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two types made for a disease called "soda", and for the cause of many humours that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all diseases that come from coldness, such as paralysis, and soda, and apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The method of this cautery is that the patient should be purged by a solving medicine, cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to the strength and age and habit of the patient. and then, do the head of the patient again.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands upon his knees;
Afterwards, place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and let your middle fingers come to where his nose bleeds, then heat the cautery which is called "olivare," of which this is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and move your hand down and in, squeezing it little by little, turning it; then lift your hand quickly, and look at the spot if you see the bone slightly protruding; and if you do not see it, then reapply the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
Afterwards, take a little salt, and put it in water and soften some cotton within, and put it on the spot, and leave it for three days;
Then place moistened cotton in butter; and leave it on until the heat is gone; Then treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer a wound remains open, the more it purges itself; and therefore so it helps.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery on until part of the bone is burned, and then remove what is burned from the bone, and then be treated.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on for so long, and push it so hard, that one removes a piece of bone as wide as a spindle that women use in their spindles, so that the humours may issue forth.
and one should leave the wound open for a long time; after that, one should treat and close it.
And these two ways of cauteries do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some men where there is a way of fear.
And I seem to have to leave it.
for the shoulder is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other limbs;
and even when the patient's shoulder is weak by nature, the first semblance of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and with this one I use work in this way together for health.
When chronic pain comes to the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills called "cochie," and head washes, and oils, and plasters; and if one does the cautery that we have previously said, and it is of no value. Beware if the patient's shoulder is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; Then cauterize below that cautery a little that we have said above. After that, cauterize on each horn of the shoulder down to the bone, as we have said before, and make a cautery in the place called "vessels"; and it is the place where leeches are applied; and place your hand so that you do not see down to the bone: The patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of that elsewhere;
And the cauteries of the horns should be finer than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the shoulder, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When sudden pain occurs in a part of the head, and the patient's suffering extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed by purifying medicines, and the other cures I have mentioned in the division of diseases have been undertaken, and none of this helps: Then, perform cauteries in two ways, namely with sharp medicine and by burning.
The cautery with sharp medicine is that you take a slice of alum, remove the bark, and cut it into two pieces, and then cut the temple where the pain resides in such a way that you can place the slice of alum under the skin;
and when it is placed there, bind it tightly and leave it like that for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the slice of alum, and leave the wound like that for two or three days; then place on it a piece of cotton soaked in butter until pus comes out.
Afterward, treat with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do so with some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The cautery of iron is thus in this manner. Heat the cautery with which this form is:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the form of a closed container, where there is little curvature, and in the middle a small appearance;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron slightly, until half the thickness of the core is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and that abundant blood flows.
After, place cotton in boiled water, and put it on the area for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want to cauterize this headache with the cautery called "cultellare", at the very tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this headache that is not old.
of headache
When you treat a headache, as we have previously said in the divisions of diseases, and it is of no benefit, and you see that the previously mentioned cauteries of medicine and iron do not suffice, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white;
and thus, apply it to the aching area in a line half a finger in length, and remove your hand once, and be careful not to cut the artery and not to reach the bone;
and beware of the jaw that moves when one chews, and the nerve does not move except when chewing and that spasms do not come to the patient, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or the cutting causes great fear, especially to the one who does not understand it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work halfway;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that these cauteries are not enough for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have said, and cure the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two knives; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the pain of the ears due to cold.
When pain in the ear comes from cold, and one has applied dissolving medicines and other treatments as we have said in the division, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery that is called "poins", of which this is the shape:
Then prick all around the diseased ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move slightly above the root of the ear once you have marked the location. and make ten pricks around each ear;
afterwards treat the area until it is healed.
of the torture of the mouth
Tortures that must be treated with cautery are no different than those caused by phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases;
and do not apply cautery to those that arise from dryness and nerve spasms.
When you treat this type of torture caused by phlegm, through emetics, purges, or gargles, and this does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and apply it to the head of the ear a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery there until half the heart is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it resembles the scalpel that we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
after treating the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
When the apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one at the place called "vessel" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, give the patient large herbs and pills that purify the brain;
afterwards, raise the patient's head completely, and place a mustard plaster, as described in the treatise on plasters, on the patient's occiput;
and this is the manner of cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If it is thus healed, it is good; and if it is not, make three cauteries from the middle of the head, descending down to the neck, and have one finger's breadth between each cautery;
and treat it like the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is enduring, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two more on the two horns, and treat it until it is healed;
and let the cauteries be called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of sores and of what we have said before;
afterwards, treat the patient's head, then cauterize it in the middle of the head and on each horn, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, then apply four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the majority of the heart is burned, and remove your hand; after the treatment, until it is healed, and let the cauteries that are called "olivare" be as we have said before.
of the epilepsy
Epileptics should not use strong fire cauteries except those who are phlegmatic, and the brain must first be cleansed with years and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is large and suffering from taking medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate it, then have them gargle and chew, cleansing the brain often with good foods;
After the head is shaved in the middle, and apply cauteries according to what we have said before, and cauteries on the vessel, and on each horn; And if the patient is strong and suffering, apply cauteries as I said for paralysis and body softening, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to the manner I have described.
If the patient is a child, apply small cauteries according to this method:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or moistures are corrupted and phlegm is thick, then cauterize with the same type of cauteries as we described for paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are inclining toward melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain is purified, according to what is stated in the previous division.
Then, shave the patient's head. Then make a well-made linen bandage, like a circle, and place it around the head;
and the patient sits crossed-legged, and is firmly held on all sides;
Then apply the liniment, and it is worth a mixture of old bear's butter; and warm it with a moderate fire, so that the patient can endure the heat when applied; Then remove the circle from inside the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient every week once, with other good treatment, until he is healthy.
Or if you want to cauterize it by making many small cauteries.
This manner of cautery softens the brain equally;
and then put on cotton soaked in butter and goose fat.
of the eye's water When water first comes to the eyes, according to the signs I mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink to purify the head and protect it from moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times when fasting.
After that, he commands him to rest his head, and he does cautery in the middle of the head, and does two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is in both eyes, or in one if the descent is in one.
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and beware of a flow of blood, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stop it with whatever power you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and the incision the precaution how you will stop it;
And sometimes one does cautery or cauterization under the two bones behind.
and when one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then apply the cautery that I have mentioned at the beginning of the disease descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or cauterizations under the two bones; and if there is further need, then cauterize wisely above the eyebrow with all the small cauteries.
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not benefit at all, then give the sick person three nights' worth of barley porridge to drink; After the head has rested, and he makes a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries of the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and be careful not to cut the artery.
And this is the shape of the cautery called "clavilis":
When the membrane of the eye is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery called "olivare". of which this is the shape:
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until a third of the membrane is burned, according to the manner I have said.
from hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelids are turned inward, and prick the eye, and cauteries are made according to two methods: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For cautery with fire, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your care; afterwards, draw on the skin of the eyes a shape like the leaves of myrtle, and let the beginning of the sign be next to the hairs;
then put cotton moistened in egg white and persillage on the eye, then heat the cautery with the shape of which here is the form:
Afterwards, cauterize on the figure you have marked little by little many times, so that the heart is burned in that place;
and the sign of the health of the work is that you see the skin retracted, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it thus for three days, then put cotton moistened in butter until the burning is removed; afterwards, cure with ointment until it is healthy.
And if afterwards the hair grows, and the skin is softened, then begin the cautery again on the same place, as you did first;
and if the hair is gone, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural position, and is even, and the hair does not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hair grow long and even, then make the shape of a myrtle leaf from parchment;
then take of French soap and of live coals, of each one a third, and grind well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it over the shape that you have made, like the myrtle leaf, and place it over the skin around the eyes; and if the patient has pain in only one eye, you should work on one, and if in both, likewise. and put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white;
and the patient's head should be in your own hand and place your index finger on the medicine, and press lightly and move it every time the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for it feels like a burn as well.
When you have done this for a long time, then remove the medicine from your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, then lift the place with water, and see if you see the paper raised as if it had been raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, then it is well.
If not, then apply more medicine to the place where the medicine hasn't worked, until your efforts are equal, and your eyes are focused.
Then put moistened cotton in butter until the burning pain is gone, afterwards treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if you need to, be very careful in your work to prevent any medicine from getting in your eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick the eye, then reapply the medicine to the area softened by the paper properly, as you did before. After treating it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that human eyes vary in size and smallness, and according to this, be your constraints.
and the right path should not be denied to the one who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments are of no benefit, then it is necessary that you apply cautery to it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place his head on your lap. and let the attendant hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move, nor does his head shift.
then place moistened cotton in egg white or persillion juice over the eye;
then heat the cautery which is such:
and is shaped at the head like the form of a swallow's wing, the same as the cautery;
if you wish, it may be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it may also be like a tent;
however, this one that is shaped like a wing is more suitable for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the corruption, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it and draw out the pus;
Afterwards, apply the hot cautery strongly, and keep your hand on the cautery at the part near the eye, so that your hand does not cause harm; and put the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you bring the cautery to the bone from the beginning, it would be good. If not, reapply the cautery once more, and again if you need it, and leave it for three days;
Afterwards, apply moistened cotton in butter, and treat it with desiccant ointment until it is healed.  And if forty days pass and it is not healed, apply an acute corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and the rest according to what he would come to in his chapter.
And there is a manner of cautery of fistula that none of the ancients said. Understand a fistula, and cleanse the place; Afterwards, place into the fissure a subtle cautery, of which the shape is this: and there are made in the quantity of a lead three. and hold your hand on the cautery firmly, and let the patient not move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one place on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water:
The lead burns the fistula site, and heals it with marvelous soundness.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, it is good. If not, then a hole must be made in the nose, and the fistula returned to its proper place in the nose's body.
Cracks in the lips Often cracks appear in the lips, called "hair," especially on the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly into those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterward treat the area with a plaster until it is healed.
When an abscess arises at the root of the throat or in the uvula, or the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, afterward it causes putrefaction and rot and becomes aged and develops into a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does not benefit at all: Then it is necessary that you apply cautery according to the extent of the fistula; afterwards, cauterize the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom and the back of it;
and do this once or twice, after the treatment that we have mentioned in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is thus cured, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicine, and that is not effective, then place the patient's head on your lap; after heat the cautery, of which the form will come afterwards in such a manner that you place a rod on the tooth;
and place the hot cautery quickly inside, and hold your hand there so long that the patient feels the heat coming to the root of the tooth;
afterward raise your hand and repeat the cautery according to your will;
afterward let the patient fill his mouth with salty water, and hold it for an hour and rinse vigorously.
And in such a manner the tooth that was moving is thus strengthened, and the soft gums restrained, and the corrupt moisture dried.
of the pain of the teeth
When tooth pain comes from cold, whether it is cold or real, and the treatments of medicine are no avail, then there is need for cautery according to two methods: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter, and the tip in a spoon of iron or bronze; Then take cotton and wrap it over the tip of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and place it on the aching tooth quickly, and hold it until it is cooled;
and thus do often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on top, so that the heat reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take a piece of iron or bronze, and it should be thick enough so that the fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person;
Then heat the cautery, from which the form will come later, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
Do this often, for the pain will be removed either that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then remove it quickly.
and this is the form of the cautery:
And make cautery of whatever head you want, and according to what you have power to do;
and this is the form of the chain:
of the scrofulas When the scrofulas are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery according to what will be presented below, and have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and place soaked cotton in butter until the burning is relieved;
afterward treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When moisture overcomes the channels of the lung, and especially when it comes from a cold constitution, then the patient must first be relieved by soluble medicines;
afterward apply cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to reach all the way to the throat itself, and not to burn the heart but a little.
Afterwards, apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let the cautery, which is called "clavile," be of the form we have shown before.
and treat the area as we have said before until it is healed.
When coughs and lung ailments are of cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is longstanding, apply two cauteries above the collarbone in empty spaces. and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cauteries be those called "clavile" according to the form that has been previously described.
And if you wish, apply cautery by pricking the entire cautery called "poins," of which the form is previously described in the illness of the ears;
and let the poins be up to 30, or in that vicinity.
After treatment of the area as previously described, and let the cauteries be in three rows according to this form:
And because of this, the cauteries are lighter, because you make three in a single strike.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset, but it cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement that occurs, as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on their back and on their side; Afterward, lift the heart that is inside the titillite with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inside, then heat the cautery that has two nerves, the form of which is this:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces the side, and the figure of the cautery would be like four cauteries together;
and for this, a cautery with three nerves is made, so that the figure of the cauterization is six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent, and this is the shape of the cautery with three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to that, so that there are eight cauteries.
After that, put the cautery on the crushed charcoal with fire; after that, make the patient rest, and do not move the limb for a long time until it is well healed.
And if it is dislocated above, which rarely happens, then make cautery on the thick part of the cautery's blade, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When cold and much moisture enter the stomach, so that they disturb its complexion, and the catarrh multiplies in it, and in the usual methods of treatment, and it does not benefit at all, then the patient should be placed on their back, and extend their legs and arms. After this, he makes three cauteries: one under the armpit, the size of a finger, with the entire cautery blade, and two cauteries outside the two ribs, so that the figure of the cauteries forms a three-angled shape, and there is such space between each that they do not touch when they generate pus.
And let the cauteries be so deep that they reach both sides of the heart, and let the figure of the cauteries be according to this shape without any adjustment:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape;
And whoever is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and making a mark on the stomach at a point according to the amount you desire. Then cauterize it with the entire cautery, which is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment we have had before, until it is healed.
When the liver is afflicted with pain from cold, moisture, and large windiness, so that it is forced out of its natural complexion by superfluities; And if the patient is treated with what we have said about divisions, and it does not benefit them, then the patient must be examined upon their bed; and mark three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity upon the liver, to ward off the hypochondria, where the ribs of the man come;
and let there be the thickness of a finger between each cautery; and let the cauteries be the length of the body, and do not press your hand too much onto the cautery;
and let only half of the heart be burned, and let the patient be upright on their feet;
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a knife, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and be careful that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not reach pus, for the heart is very sensitive in that area, and you should know that for sure.
When there is an abscess on the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain not too strongly;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels violent pain.
And then, when this treatment dries up the pus, the patient should be placed on his head;
and then drain the area where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery iron, which is shaped like a ray, of which here is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the flesh is burned, and it comes down to the surface, until the pore is completely opened;
after the treatment, according to the treatment of poultices, until it is healed;
and it is not appropriate for anyone to use this cautery except those who have studied medicine for a long time, and through whose hands these illnesses have run sometimes.
Then he can work boldly, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone.
by cauterization with a cautery.
The ancients said that one should make cauteries with aristolochia roots, and in this manner: Take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and also as thick and as long as your fingers; and soak it in oil, and hold it over the fire, and cauterize with the cautery between the cheek and the jaw, and two small cauteries a little further down on the part below the beard;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping back a little; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and one more above the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast, outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly, just as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery that resembles a razor, and they heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess; and the pain leaves, just as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work, there is fear, where the patient dies now, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse according to what we have said about the divisions of treatments, and it is of no use, then three kinds of cautery apply, all of which are good.
Of which one manner is that you make three or four cauteries, cutting along the length of the mouse, according to the shape of the liver cautery we have mentioned before;
and do not press your hand too hard on the entire cautery, and let the patient lie often on their back;
and another manner of cautery is that you heat the cautery with two nerves, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is near the mouse, or the patient's ribcage comes towards the left side, and let the elevation from which you lift the heart be according to the heart's direction, according to the length of the body, and the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards, put the two inflamed nerves so that the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the entire cautery on three nerves.
After the treatment, when it has cast off corruption for a long time, and this is worth more than the other treatments previously mentioned.
Cautery is of no value to a dropsy patient, except in the manner called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in divisions, and your treatment does not benefit at all, then you must make four cauteries around the abdomen, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back on the spine, and one on the breast. And let the cauteries be close to the thick part of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to allow the pus to drain for a long time, and do not discontinue the treatment of the patient after the cautery. And healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be joined together with the help of God.
The shape of the cautery for the abdomen should be the clavile that we have shown before. And the one for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what has been described before.
When the feet are swollen in someone who is hydrops, and are full of yellow water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the yellow water should burst forth, and let the cautery be according to this shape:
Afterwards, make two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the little finger; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without curing, so that the water may issue;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have spoken of.
When belly discomfort comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive virtues in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by any treatments; and if you see the patient suffering greatly and with strong powers, apply a large cautery to the stomach, according to what has been discussed previously, or a circular cautery of the stomach; and four smaller cauteries around the belly, one small cautery on each hip.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, apply a cautery to the groin, and one cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach next to the large one, for the cure is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, moist, corrupted humors, and have been treated as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help at all, then apply cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those that are completely outside the buttocks, little by little in a triangular shape, and one cautery below the belly on both sides.
And if you think his stomach is cold, and the food does not digest, and you see the face swelling, then on the face place one large cautery on the stomach, as previously mentioned, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen, placing all the cauteries at the proper intervals. And leave the cautery open for a long time. After treatment, leave the area until it is healed.
When you cut the althelul, heat the cautery, which resembles a razor, and then place it, all ablaze, onto the cut althelul. and hold it there with your hand until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows.
Do this once or twice, and if there is much althelul, cauterize each one as we have said. Afterward, apply ointments that are beneficial until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on the alchatim, it will be of greater assistance.
When the patient cannot tolerate cutting or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness comes that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula appears, and it is old and casts off corrupt pus and moisture, you must probe it thoroughly with a fine probe, and carefully note how deep it goes.
Afterwards, heat the cautery, which resembles a scraper, and insert it into the fistula according to the depth the probe reached, and repeat the cautery until that putrid and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to its need.
and beware of burning the nerves that are nearby, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the bladder and the intestine, then beware of those places, and only apply the fire to the fleshy areas, and consider that it is not penetrating.
Afterward, treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed.
And if the matter has not been removed, know that the area is gaping, and the bone at the bottom is corrupt. And thus, as one of those that we shall describe in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from great windiness, and does not take the form of a woman, then it is necessary that you make cautery on the kidneys on one side and the other with the clavil cautery that we have previously described;
And if we cauterize it in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and greater aid will be given.
Of the bladder When the bladder is weak and cold and damp, so that the patient retains urine, then make cautery on the outer part of the bladder, where the hair of the knife begins, and one to the right and one to the left, and let each cautery be as long as the nail of a thumb;
and make one cautery outside the back, or two if you need it;
and let the cauteries be shaped according to the form previously stated.
When the marrow is cold and damp, and does not allow conception, and the flowers are corrupted and their ends delayed; and when they come, there is great pain. Then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the bladder, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries behind the back;
and let the cauteries be sharp, as we have said.
When viscous moisture descends to the socket of the hip, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and if the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip socket with one cautery shaped like a circle, and mark it in front of the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is within the circle;
and let the cautery be of the same kind as those used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the other cauteries;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain in the hip When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient has been treated according to what we have said in the division, and the treatment is ineffective, and the illness is old: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of the thick humors with foul pills, or other similar good pills. After that, apply cautery;
and the method of cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, burning medicines together, and cautery by fire.
Cautery by fire is according to many methods, of which one is this:
that you cauterize over the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this shape, and make them deep and wide, and have a space the thickness of a finger between each cautery, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes cautery is made in the middle over the head of the hip, so that there are four according to this shape:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the thick parts of the core are burned.
And this is how it is done in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or the leg.
And if it goes down to the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle, four inches, slightly to the left side;
and let the cauteries be knife-like, and let the thickness of the core be burned;
and if the patient feels the pain extend to the toes or near the heel, cauterize where he feels the pain three or four times with the cautery that is called "points". And if necessary, make more.
And if you know that the pain is below the knee toward the thigh, make a cautery with a knife-like or circular cautery, and take good care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and major arteries, and that you do not cause the patient further harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen several who made a cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot as well, and the entire foot was pierced and corrupted. After a solution of the belly, from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make cautery on one and on the other, according to this manner.
And the wise said in the cautery of the hip, of which this is the manner, make one such iron and let it be at the head as thick as a finger-nail, or a little less, and let it be in cross-sections and let it be from one cross-section to the other a distance the size of a finger joint;
and let the cross-sections be opposite on two sides, and let them be like knots, and let there be one handle of iron well made;
and this is the shape:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then one places it on the hip of the sick person, and let it be turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize once, cauterize again and leave it three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment of ointment until it is healed.
Albucasim says that we use little of this cautery because of fear of its effect, and we see few who use it;
and nevertheless, this is a good cautery, for those who can endure it, and in the place where it is suitable.
The cautery of burning medicine is such that you make an instrument with hinges on which the blade of the door descends, and it should be of brass or iron with a long blade, and in the height it should have two nubs, and there should be the thickness of a finger between each; and they should be open at the front and above, and join together according to this shape:
Then place the box of the hip on the sick person lying on the healthy side, and firmly place your hand on the hip box; then pour between the two circles of warm water, which has been heated by the fire a little, and leave it for an hour, and let the patient endure the heat and burning.
For he finds there a burning like that of fire;
and when the burning is passed, remove your hand with the instrument and lift the hip from the sweet water, and leave it for three days, and apply butter until what is black from the scalding is removed; and leave it for three days for the pus to drain out;
and this would be the final aid after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has spread to the thigh or to the leg, you shall make an instrument that stains with water, in the same way as you did for the hip;
and this is the method of hot water, and I have written it in the treatment of the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole to allow the point of a razor to enter;
where there is a small hole to allow the point of a razor to enter; and place another well-sealed pot over the first, and place alkali and lime and sweet water on top, until there is a finger's breadth above the powders when you have held it firmly in your hand;
and let it sit thus until the water descends and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very sharp and is administered in various medical works and cauterizations of other limbs.
For it works like fire, and there are other medicines with which one can cauterize the hip well, such as thistle, honey, myrrh, and lime mixed with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of hip and sciatic pain, and praises it highly, saying that no other cure was made, and that he was healed in a single time after this cure was done, and he was bathed as he shows below.
And says in this manner that you should take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it finely with a little grease, and put it on the hip, thigh, and leg where the pain is, and bind it.
and leave it on for three hours, and by the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then have him enter the bath until his body is slightly wet, and have him go to bed, and the pain will go away entirely and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it helps greatly.
and the cauteries must be done in such a manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it over the hollow that is between the big toe and the other toe, which is called the foscile.
Afterwards, take dry goat's dung and heat it in fire until it is embers, and place it over the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
and repeat this in the same way, and do not cease doing so until you think, by your senses, that it reaches the hip, and that the pain has ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "cautery of goats".
of the pain in the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from falling or impact or from excessive evacuation, or from a similar spreading of cold matter, none of these methods are valuable for cauteries, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary, after the patient has been emptied of fetid pills or other similar things, that one make three lines of incisions on the back, wherever the pain resides, and in each line five cauteries, or more, according to the strength and quantity that the patient can bear;
and let the cauteries be made according to the cautery that is called "points";
and if you wish, make three or four cauteries at the middle claviform cautery, according to this form:
Often this sickness comes to young children, and the signs of its beginning are that they have a tight chest when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and on the others where it appears.
When you see this and wish to cure it, cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery encompasses each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a pointed cautery, two or three lines, and the points should be close together.
After curing the area until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not apply cautery to any swelling that is in the area of a nerve.
Of the pain of the joints
When joint pains are caused by moisture spread throughout the body, and when pain is in the feet, which the doctors call "podagra" properly, and when it is of a cold nature and cures with medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cauteries in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary that you prick on the sole of the foot, make a cautery, the whole cautery is called a "point". And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, make three or four cauteries on each knee, of each part, all olive-shaped cauteries;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there for longer than necessary to burn the thickness of the heart.
And if the pains descend to the knee and the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make pricks around the knuckle, two lines.
and if any pain remains in the fingers, make pricks on each joint and on the hair of the hand.
and if the pains come down to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and have them take medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge the phlegm, he will be healed by God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the swelling descends to the testicles, and it is new, then when you wish to treat it, he should not eat that day. and that he use things that loosen the belly, so that the stool descends from his belly;
Afterwards, make him sit on his back in your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the swelling is repaired, and bring the swelling to your fingers, and make a sign underneath the rupture on the bone of the thigh, and a whole sign that is similar to half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery with which this form is:
until it is white and emits sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and let the minister hold his hand upon them so that they do not return back;
and properly open the patient's thighs, and put a cushion under him and a servant upon the thighs, and another upon his chest who shall hold his hands;
then place the cautery upon the mark with all your hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, then begin again another time until you come down to the bone; and carefully guard that the bowel does not jump when you do the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that by this the patient does not die, or other harm.
And know that when you do not come down to the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cauteries of children be subtle according to their size, and of large people as large according to their size;
after three days treat the cautery site with butter until the burn is removed;
after that, treat with other ointments until it is healed, and the patient lies on their back for 40 days so that the wound is well closed;
and it is necessary that their nourishments be light for a long time, so that the bowels do not loosen when they try to go to the chamber.
And after 40 days, when they want to get up, give them a well-made bandage, and keep it on for another 40 days;
and let them have good rest, let them do little work and beware of excessive drinking and eating, and of excessive exertion;
and when they follow this instruction, they are entirely healed.
And I will tell hereafter the treatment of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are no longer growing, you should apply the cautery cauterization according to its size, and the third part of the heart should be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients said it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place of incision and make a line along the width above the rupture, and another outside, and place your hand in the middle to hold the entire cautery firmly.
But the first cauteries are lighter and milder.
of ancient pain in any limb When pain comes to any limb, from falling or striking, and that pain lasts a long time, and the treatment of medicine is not helpful, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery that is called "point", and the cautery should be according to the length of the limb and its smallness, its weakness, its virtue, its location of twists and its pain.
If it is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
If not, repeat another cautery on that one, for such is the custom that it must spread to the limb that is closest to it, for which it is necessary for you to make cauteries until the patient is healed.
Medleys are sometimes aided by cautery, greatly helping, and especially those ailments that come from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it being cauterized, be careful if the ailment is in its early stages, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not worsen or linger, and you fear that the corruption will affect the entire patient, then apply five cauteries to the head: One in the middle of the head, and the other towards the forehead at the end of the hair; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and let your hand do so that the cauteries reach the bone, and until the crusts come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize the wound according to what is before.
And if the disease is widespread throughout; and if it is clearly lost, you must cauterize it with those cauteries we have mentioned, one cautery on the forehead, two cauteries on the spine of the neck, six cauteries on the spine of the back, one large one on the rump and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the breast, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and be careful of the nerves that are on the back of the calf, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one cauterizes on the bone of the knee, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give him, and the more profit he has;
And know that the sick person does not feel any pain from the cautery like healthy people do, because the body is already entirely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you find in the various types of irons.
After the treatment, cover the area with flour of chickpeas with honey and other treatments until it is healthy.
When swelling comes to any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then you should apply cauteries to the limb according to the limb's size and smallness;
and the cauteries should be a little penetrating into the thickness of the flesh; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes cauteries are applied to the hand and foot and back, at the exit of the nerve that paralyzes the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and however, no one should intervene if they are not knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the illness called "albaras" has grown old, and the remedies of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the quantity of the thickness of the core, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed.
then treat it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and blood of a colon and blood of an almond, a part of each. and mix all together, and bind it with a cloth, and apply it to the affected area until it is healed.
the treatment of a sore by cautery
When a sore appears at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the sore.
And nevertheless, wise people say that one should also cauterize the middle of the sore;
and nevertheless, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it may become ulcerated and corrupt, and I have already seen this happen several times;
and a more appropriate thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery called "circle," as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has an illness called "adubelati," and it delays healing, either because of the superfluity it causes, or because of the patient's age when they are decrepit (that is, too old) and have little blood, or because of the time; and you wish to hasten its healing: then cauterize it around with many small cauteries by pricking; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to heal.
And if you wish to pierce it with the entire cautery, heat the cautery in the form of which this is.
And place your hand in the midst of the sickness, called "adubelati," until the cauteries have pierced the core, and let the cauteries be such that the patient feels them outside in such a manner that the course of the corruption is relieved.
Afterward, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
Another kind of sickness exists, called "corrodens," which is nothing other than a consuming of a limb, for it devours the limbs just as fire devours dry wood.
If you see this sickness in a place that can bear cautery with fire, then heat the cauteries, small and large, according to what is appropriate for the place where the sickness is.
After cauterizing from all sides until you have eradicated all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that which is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it three days, and put on the cauterized places a soothing poultice with oil until the heat of the fire is gone, and all corruption.
After the treatment with ointments that generate flesh.
And if after three days you see that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good.
and if not, then reapply cautery to those places that remain corrupted.
And this affliction is sometimes cured with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
However, fire cautery is of greater aid, and I have already described the treatment with sharp medicine in the division: Take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come to the feet Often, a disease called "clos," in our understanding, arises on the feet from outside, and is a large, enclosed swelling that hurts the foot.
And the cauteries for this disease are according to two ways. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cauterization by fire is that you heat a cautery iron, just as a piece of roofing tile, and it should be made of good iron, sized so it can embrace the wound from all sides, and have fine edges;
Then, place it hot upon the wound, and turn your hand around the wound until it reaches the bottom of the wound; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to throw off corruption; Then make a poultice of wild mallows crushed with oil, and leave the poultice on all night, and the wound will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with an ointment of healing herbs until it is healed.
And if they are burned by external fire, and this often happens on hands and feet, you must apply a cautery with hot water; and it is in this manner: take a rod of bronze or iron, or a piece of flint, and place it over the wound and the boil, that is to say for warts; and place the rod over it so that it covers everything around it, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand by turning so that the edge of the rod reaches the root of the boil, and can find the hot water path deep to the root;
and let the patient endure a little the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will detach itself from all its roots.
Thus do one after another, until you remove all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When some tremble from cold nerves, or from quartan fever or other, you must make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with the olive-shaped cautery;
This will stop the trembling, and the health of the cold illness will be hastened.
Sometimes foul-smelling boils or pustules appear on the body, arising from large corrupted matter.
If, when they appear, one should immediately apply cautery to each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose point is heated in fire, or of long aristolochia root, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow further, but the superfluities from which they arise are broken up, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times great bleedings of blood from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes to the outside, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and similar things; and it is a very grievous thing to stanch.
And nevertheless, when this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and hold it firmly until the blood is stilled beneath your finger, and no more drops come out;
then put the olive-shaped cauteries, several small and large, into the fire until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small, according to the wound and the place where the artery is severed, and place the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it leaps out strongly when you remove your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from the fire.
And do not cease to do this, one after the other, until the blood is stopped;
and be careful that you do not burn the nerve that is beside it, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be properly stopped, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four methods we have stated: or by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by a strong tying of thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stop blood; and be bound and held firm.
Whoever applies a bandage or tight wrapping with cloths or places burning things on it, or other similar things, will not profit much.
And if this happens to someone and they do not have a remedy or medicine available, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein, as we have said, and press it firmly until the bleeding is stopped from the wound and from the vein; and do not move the finger, but moisten it with cold water often, so that it is very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and make inquiries beforehand about the cauteries and medicines needed.
In the first chapter, we have told you about every ailment requiring cautery by fire or burning medicine, and the incisions, causes, instruments, and forms of cauteries;
and I have arranged that chapter from head to foot, and I will follow the same path in this chapter so that one can more readily find what one seeks.
And before I begin this, dear son, you must understand that this chapter contains more danger and fear than the first on cauteries, and therefore requires greater caution.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often blood evacuation when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you not to undertake foolish things. For many kinds of people come for cures. so come those who become so angered with their illness that they die easily because of the frenzy they find in their illness, and from the greatness of its malice. and of these one must have fear.
And of these there are some who give you their sense, and say: wait, I am healed"; and the sickness is spiteful.
You should not agree with those who come to you with this manner, but put more emphasis on your honor than on your greed, and do not act foolishly, but wisely, about that of which you are certain, and of which you can have taken and praise;
and use prognosis and indication in the treatment of your sick, so that health may be converted;
and this will help you acquire good reputation, glory, and a memory of praise.
Dear son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and uprightness, and if you wish to inspire yourself from the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now, I have arranged this chapter, as it is before the chapter on cauteries, dividing it into chapters, from head to toe, so that you may find more easily what you will need.
Know that this illness often comes to children during childbirth, and when the midwife tightens the child's head too much;
and sometimes it comes from an unknown cause.
And I have never seen this illness except in children, and in all those I have seen death came quickly. And therefore it seems to me that it is best to leave such treatments.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger each day until it could no longer support it.
And the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture gathers under the bone on the surface, between the heart and the bone;
And the treatment is such if the moisture is between the heart and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you should make a wide incision through the head;
and as long as two fingers, until the moisture flows.
and see here the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is deeper, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions in the shape of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs show that the openings of the head are exposed on each side, and the pus leaps out when you press it with your hand inside, and this has not been resolved: then you should make three incisions through the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, remove all the moisture outward. Afterwards, bind the incisions with bandages and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it this way until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with poultices and ointments, and leave the head to heal evenly, and give the patient dry, low-moisture food until the limb is strengthened and healthy.
And another way of incision is that you look at the extent of the abscess and the collection of water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Then cut where the abscess is open and the fluid is filling it, and cut it according to your ability;
and be careful not to cut the artery; and if blood flows, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a disease called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is long-standing, and the treatment of medicine does not help, then the final treatment is cauterization, with that by which they will cut the two arteries.
It is necessary then, when you are about to cut them, that the patient hold back his head; Afterwards, they rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens his neck with all his strength; Then look where the veins are, and the places of each are near the ears, and they are slightly swollen;
Then mark the places with a mark, then cut one and the other with a sharp instrument from two sides, so that the incision reaches the bone, and this should be along the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the instrument under the artery and cut above it, cutting in the same manner as you should through.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously outwards.
And if the artery is not apparent to the touch, then you must measure the amount of space by three fingers, then mark it and cut down to the bone;
and what is necessary to draw blood out is VI ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can bear, and the fullness of the artery;
then look at the wound: if there remains on the bone any trace of pus, then cut it so that festering sores do not come, then bind the wound and apply ointment until it is healed.
of a migraine When a chronic migraine comes, and an acute cold, due to moisture in the tears and the heat in the temples and chronic madness and similar things, and he is treated with various medicinal cures and none of it benefits him, then we will open the arteries in the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of opening them is that the patient pulls back the hair on his temples, and finds the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears clearly through its beating, and is rarely found exposed except in some very cold men;
and if it is hidden, the patient will tie its neck with some cloth, then rub the area with a rough cloth, and bathe the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula, of which here is the form: then scrape the skin lightly until you reach the artery, then pull it upward with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath from each side;
and if the artery is subtle, then turn it with the point of the hook, then cut that part according to the size of two fingers. For if it is not cut, the blood will not completely flow out.
And draw blood from the VI c/ until III;
and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no corruption comes before the wound is closed, and bleeding occurs.
then cut the excess that is between the two ties at that same time, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with the surgical cautery to the bone until the flesh is cut;
and this is the better work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a hot complexion. For cauterization is a help to end moistures: Therefore, it is of greater help for moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the space with old cotton and place well-made bandages over it;
and when they are removed, they should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until they are healed;
and if blood flows from the artery while you work on it, then quickly cauterize it, or fill the space with vitriol and hold it with your hand to stop the bleeding; and if you do not have this present, then place your finger over the area until the blood is congealed, and wash the area with cold water until the blood stops, and hold it firmly as necessary;
And there should be one finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the burning iron on top so that it goes down to the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two sides, for it is not completely fused by this cautery.
and this is the form of the cautery:
And the method that is gentler and easier in extracting the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery from two sides, but the sharpness should be quite thick to retain the heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes are flowing down the veins that are above the head of the forehead, and no medicine applied will help, and you see the patient's face becoming red, and feel trembling in the forehead, and if the skin is thin and moist so that the hairs of the temples have fallen out, and the temples are scorched and blistered by the burning tears, then this treatment is needed. And the ancients called it "contused cure," and you should do the following to the patient who has this illness: remove the hair on the forehead, and then make three equal cuts on the forehead along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contused cure," and you should do the following to the patient who has this illness: remove the hair on the forehead, and then make three equal cuts on the forehead along the length of the forehead; and one of the cuts should be like two fingers straight down to the nose, and the other two at the temples, above the skin, and be careful to avoid cutting the arteries that are at the temples above the skin;
and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jaws, and make each wound about three fingers across;
and have ready a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe the blood, then apply the spatulate, sharp on both sides, of which this is the shape:
from the incision next to the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two incisions, all the surface that is above the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then pull out this spatulate. then put into the first incision the instrument called "cultellaire", and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is soft, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And place the cutting side of the knife towards the flesh, close to the heart, and the soft side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous up to that which appears of the heart, and then do the same in the middle incision up to the other incision;
and then extract the blood equally, and press the area for the blood taken.
Then put a tent of old cotton in each incision, and put on cloths soaked in wine, oil, and vinegar, and guard that hot abscesses do not come to it.
and on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer much warmed water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
When some experience acute colds commonly, and you see the eyes swollen and small, and the sight weakened, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; Then know through these symptoms that this matter and this cold comes from many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And you command the patient to lie on their back, then make a large cut across the forehead, and another cut lengthwise. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move with eating;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two edges of the cut and put old cotton and linen strips in it; then bind over damp cloths soaked in wine and oil, and guard against a hot abscess;
when it is removed, it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things that cause flesh to grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and make a poultice; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow throughout.
of the stopping of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of the four things: or grains, or a beast, or a stone of the mine, or similar things like iron; or seeds, such as mustard, beans, peas; or things that flow, such as water and oil and similar things.
When a stone or any other object that does not join with or grow in the ear falls into it, place the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then distill a small amount of violet oil or oil of sesamum, and then administer extraction. and make him sneeze with condiment, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upward.
Often, this treatment brings forth pus.
and if it does not bring forth pus, then administer extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it bursts forth with the forceps, it is good;
If not, then administer extraction with a fine, small double-edged lancet;
and if it does not burst forth with that, make a copper wire and thrust the end of the wire into the ear's opening firmly, and plug what is around the wire with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the wire; then pull it forth forcefully, for many times it bursts forth, as we have said;
and if it does not burst forth in such a manner, then take glue with which birds are caught, and put upon it some instrument made ready for this, and put a little cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever, and pull forth.
And if it does not burst forth from all these things that we have said, then hasten to pierce the ear before a hot abscess comes there, and spasm.
And the manner of the piercing is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to the measure of their strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn their ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, at the fat or dependent place; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your power, and quickly suck it into your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is grains that are inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin, subtle spatumile according to this form: and administer an incision to that grain.
But do not do this at all when you think the grain is moist due to the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract it with fine tweezers and by suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
In the water that falls into the ear, the patient should first use sneezing motions, and stuff the ear with old cotton. And let him lie down on that same ear where the water is. If it springs out by doing that, it's good.
If not, then take many stones according to the length of your finger and light, and warm them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the hole of their ear, and leap upon it with their feet on the other side, and place another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not cease to do this with stone on stone until the water is entirely expelled, and then it springs out entirely.
And if you wish, take a reed, and put one end into the ear, and the other end grasp with fire until the softest part of the reed is burned.
Then do likewise with other reeds until the water is entirely expelled, as we have said concerning the stone.
In the extraction of vermin, if it is of small body, such as fleas and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division.
But if it is of large body that one can feel, then administer extraction with pincers. And that is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms lodged in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not work, then you must examine the ear in the sun. If any worms appear, remove them with fine pincers, and if none appear, then take the instrument of which this is the shape:
And it should be narrow below and wide above. And insert the most slender end of the instrument into the ear according to the severity of the patient's suffering, then suck strongly with the whole instrument. Do this often until all the worms exit.
And if they do not obey and exit, then stuff around the instrument with cotton as I have said for the stone.
And if they do not jump out as we have said, administer the distillations that the ancients have tested for the killing of worms, and you will find them in the treatment of distillations.
And distill your oils and medicines into the ear using this instrument, of which this is the form as you see: And it is of silver or bronze, narrow below with little holes, and open above for distilling.
And to press the distillation into the instrument of bronze well made for this, and if you wish, take a rasp and wrap around the point some cotton; Then pour your oil or juice, and whatever medicines you wish into the tube, and let the tube be in the ear;
Then put the rasp with all the cotton inside, and press your hand gently until the oil is distilled into the ear's end; And the patient feels it inside, and let the distillation be a little warmed over the fire beforehand so that it is distilled into the ear; And be careful that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be very good.
Of the stopping up of the ears
No child is born who does not have any holes in their ears;
And this same thing happens to men by the blockage of a wound, or from flesh growing inside the ear, and these blockages sometimes go deep into the ear, so that one cannot see them;
And sometimes there is a little puff over the hole, and one sees it clearly.
That which goes deep, so that one cannot see it, is of difficult healing in many situations, and in that which one sees, you should put the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: If you see the apparent obstruction, then work on all the [spatumile], of which this is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, all smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
If the obstruction is of flesh born or a growth on the ear, then hold it with delicate forceps and cut it gently, until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is deep inside the ear, then take a delicate, lightweight scraper and heat it slightly in the fire, then place it on the growth in the ear.
If you sense the obstruction of which the patient feels a pain when hearing, pierce it gently, and take care not to injure the nerves of the ear;
Then place a tent in the ear according to the width of the opening, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is closed, or you take a tent and moisten it with rose water, and sprinkle powdered crushed vitriol on it;
And if you see the ear swollen, you should remove the tent and place another tent moistened in a cerote made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, dip a sponge and cloth in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the discharge of blood which are in the treatment of distillations.
This ulcer that comes on the papers of the eyes when they are moist and dry, you must extend them with tweezers and pincers, and cut it with a spatule from its roots; then put powdered vitriol on the area.
And if blood discharges, cauterize it with a fine, lens-shaped cautery, and the cauterization after the incision is worthwhile.
and many times it returns, when anything remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of hail Many times there come from the eyes' papery things that appear like hail in shape and hardness, and for this reason this disease is called "grandine," and it is a gathering of thick moisture in the papery substance above and below; the work is such:
the work is such: take care if the grandine moves from one side to the other, and it is an easy thing to know;
then cut it lengthwise, then scrape it slightly from each part, then take it with pliers and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the paper a little, then do not harm the patient;
and if the fissure is large, then join it with a stitch, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, then do not force it, for the ointment will restore it quickly and generate flesh.
And if the large stone is descending into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, then turn the paper over, and pull the stone with pliers, and cut it and press it on both sides;
and if the stone is loosened by the incision, that does not harm;
and when the stone is cut, then wash the eye with salty water, and treat the place with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a fat that grows in webs of papers on top, and this happens more to children than to adults, and it greatly afflicts their eyes, and catarrh comes to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sun's light because their tears rush to their eyes;
and because of this, they often lie on their faces, sleep on their backs, and their stones under their eyebrows are moist, so that the swelling and appearance have covered the exinach that appears in the eye. And when you press the place with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the method of treatment is that the patient place their head in your hand;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the amount of exinach in each part, and then place it over it; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered within the circle;
then cut into the middle of the moisture with a sharp instrument, a slit of the width, and it should not be any larger than the incision made when drawing blood from a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in many positions exinach comes from the slit, according to the shape of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it, using a whole piece of cloth caught between your fingers as a safeguard, and turn your hand to the right and to the left until it is dispersed;
and be careful not to push into the slit, so you don't reach the entire spatumile all the way to the eye, and hurt it.
And if the exirnach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, then slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then wet cloths with oil and water, and place over the area, and bind with bandages.
And if there are such men who grind stones and apply them to corrupt the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes to the area, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the paper. When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural ones, and grow old, they harm the eyes and cause various ailments, such as accustomed tears and softening of the eyelids and the conjunctiva, to the point that it is the cause of the destruction of the eyes.
and the treatment is according to four methods: or by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine, according to what is before in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by cauterization, according to what I will say.
You must place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid to your left hand.
If it is turned, that is good. If not, then insert a needle along the entire thread above. And let it be next to the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow next to those hairs, and pull the thread above the entire eyelid, and turn it over with a razor.
Then make an incision in the part below the eyelid, under the attached hairs, cutting across the entire space, from the large tear duct to the small one.
Then pull out the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and linen beneath the eyelid; then place an appropriate shape on top of the eyelid, like the leaf of myrtle, but the shape must correspond to the amount of eyelid lifting you want to achieve, which is determined by everyone.
And if one needs to cut a large quantity of eyelid according to how soft the eyelid is.
Then cut across the entire space along the two lines you have drawn, starting from the large tear duct and moving towards the small one. And let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs, the thickness of a root; then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the wound, and then peel it all away.
Then stitch the two edges together with a fine wool thread using a needle, and wipe away the blood, and if you wish to do so, dry the excess threads on the two eyebrows using some glue-like substance.
And if not, give no further treatment; then leave the stitches and threads for three or four days.
Then treat the wound without stitches, using drying and constricting substances, for the papyrus rises to the healing of the wound and its joining, but stitches are weaker (as the ancients said), and this is a treatment without fear. And if there is another method:
And if there is another method: And there is another way: you should shape the papyrus into a form resembling a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three separate incisions according to the shape shown here:
Then cut off what rises above, with small equal forces, according to the shape shown here:
And if you lack the strength to hold the pliers, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread and put it through the figure; and place another thread beside the large tear, and the second thread beside the small one, and join the threads between your fingers evenly;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin above where you have marked, as we have described, then join the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess arises at your incision, soothe it with cerotes and similar softening ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the paper are converted:
if so, you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more artificial.
The treatment of canes is according to this form: and is that you convert the paper and the slit inside according to what I have said, and then make two canes by art, and two thin bands as long as the paper and the width of the spatula is; and cut as two heads from two sides where you hold the threads;
then assemble one and the other subtly upon that which rises from the paper of the eye, and bind the two canes from the two parts firmly; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin that was bound will die and become dark and rotten, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with some force, then cure it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, and if the paper is removed, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the form of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
the work is such that you take a fine needle, and put a fine, soft silk thread into it; then assemble the ends and tie them together subtly, and let the length of the threads be a palm long;
then arrange another fine silk thread in the chase briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then place the patient's head on your breast;
and let it be beside the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and fine work, then put the needle with the whole chase into the root of the hair itself, and make it pierce the paper quickly so that you pull it over the natural hair;
then pull the hair out to the chase, and put that hair into the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then pull your hand so that the hairs come out with the whole chase in the paper along with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then you will pull the chase downwards along the entire thread you have ordered, until the chase comes out of the hole above and you see it with your eye;
then you will pull the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair settles in its place and flesh grows over;
and if the hair is small, then attach one long hair from the natural hairs, and let it grow with that one, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
of the rot of the eye When this disease, which is called "aleacrati" or rot, comes to the eye, there are two types of it:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through the wounding of a cut, or by a cut or cautery, and by similar things.
And the method of treatment is that you split that wound, and separate the edges, and put linen strips inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and you should not use things that dry and constrict in treating it. For if you do that, the sickness will return worse than the first;
but use softening things, like fenugreek; and irrigate with water or cooked flaxseed, and ointments of diachylon melted into any oil, and wrap a bandage with that, and treat it with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you take care that it does not heal in the same form as before;
and these treatments we have mentioned are only ways to prevent this illness from returning in the same form as before.
This disease that is beneath, which is truly called "axacrati", and is natural and accidental.
The accident comes from wounds and cuts and cautery and similar things;
And the method of treatment in this case is that you take a needle, with a double thread on it, and stick it into the flesh, and pierce it from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out at two points in the flesh;
Then stretch the flesh above the needle, and cut it with a spatula wide. And if the paper's figure returns according to what is required, it is good;
If not, take a scraper and place it in the cut, and turn the paper, and make two cuts on the inside edge of the paper;
and let the ends of the two cuts be at the two angles of the incision you have made, and make angles so that when they are joined, the figure is like the figure of a letter called "I Greek";
Then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its edges are sharp below, of that which covered the paper, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread;
then treat it with the remedies we have mentioned, softening and with dressings, until it is healed.
And if the ailment comes from a cut, or stitching, or cautery, then you must make a cut, full, beneath the hairs of the paper, and according to what is mentioned above; then separate between the two flaps of a dressing, as I have said;
then separate between the two flaps of a dressing, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and wise masters devise remedies with all their power so that they can return the form to its natural shape;
and the patient himself, according to what work and instruments are needed in various situations.
When this joining happens to people in such a way that the paper on top is joined with the white of the eye, and cannot move or do its natural work, then you must put the tip of a razor under the paper and lift it up;
and extend it with tweezers, until you cut what is sticking to the subtle septum, which should not be too sharp or too sharp, so that the patient cannot suffer the sharp septum from injuring the eye;
and let your incision, with which you scorch that joined part, be gentle, so that the paper returns to its natural shape;
and the entire joining is healed, and sometimes they use sharp salty water in the eye, and then remove it with fresh water and cold water;
then put a linen tent between the paper and the eye, and put wet wool on the eye in abundance with egg; and after the third day use cold water and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two manners: It is nervous and similar to a hard surface, and another that is not nervous, but is similar to frozen white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and tries to grasp it with pincers, one cannot.
And both appearances begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight, all light, and the movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient should place their head on your chest, then open their eyes; and lift the paper with your hand, then grasp the nail with small double-edged pincers, and pull it upwards; then take a needle, and put a horse's hair, or cow's, or ox's hair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle slightly and insert it into the nail, and pierce it completely with the needle, and tie the nail with thread and pull it upward, and remove all hair from the side of the nail that touches the pupil and the silk, down to the root, then cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with fine and gentle force, and leave the natural tear duct, so that the flow of tears does not come from the incision.
and sometimes the nail is pulled out with the forceps only, and with the thread, as we have said; then one removes it with gentle force, of which the form is this:
And be careful that the forceps do not touch the fleshy tissue and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little bit of bruised oil, and some colander made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot push the needle, and the lancets cannot enter, this kind of nail is often treated with medicine;
and grow as I have described in the division, and if you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye and take a slightly pointed forceps according to this form: And carefully lift the nail, and if you see that it diminishes slightly and the flesh presses on it, then drop from your mouth into the eye, litharge-made colander, red colander and bruised oil, and plug the eye until the next day;
If something opposes you in the eye, such as a boil, then leave it, and first treat the boil until it is healed, then recommence the work as before until it is healed.
then repeat the other work according to this same operation until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the tear duct's flesh harms the eye greatly, then suspend it with forceps, and cut off a part, not all, so that no tear ducts remain;
then instill into the eye red colander made of litharge.
In some men's eyes, flesh sometimes grows red, and covers the pupil and tightens upon the eyelids and turns outwardly, and looks like a rose of balaustine;
and the procedure is for the patient to put their head into your (the healer's) lap, then open their eyes, and the physician grasps all that flesh with suitable forceps, and holds it firmly;
then cut off the first layer of flesh, and continue cutting with a scalpel until the end, and take care not to injure the eye in the process;
and let the incision be with the spatula we mentioned in the incision of the nail and with small instruments with which one removes the scab, as the form after this chapter demonstrates;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh is removed, then apply to the eye a seil broth or you distill red collyrium and similar corrosive medicines, and place over the eye externally a cotton with a bandage of egg, so that it is assured against a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and the blood or pus overwhelms you, and you suspect a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do when many layers of flesh are adhered to the eye in this manner.
However, it is necessary that you lighten the treatment of each weak eye by natural means; and by the accidental way, in the work of iron;
and do not put your hand into any of these works until you see that these limbs are enduring that work.
There are red veins that are covering the eye, and they hinder the eye's work and weaken the eye every day.
It is necessary for the first that you look to see if the eye, in which the bloodshot is, is strong, and there is no other illness there besides the bloodshot; then treat it in this way:
instruct the patient to put their head against your chest, then compress those veins with all the tools according to your skill, and let the tools be thin, doubled according to this form:
And let there be two tools arranged in a row according to this shape:
then gently compress the veins, and wipe away the blood one hour after another, until you see the veins moving away from the eye;
and be careful not to pierce the eye with the tips of the tools, and perform this work at midday before the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you do not cut anything other than the veins;
and when you have done this, distill green and red vitriol into the eye to corrupt what remains of the infection.
And if you cannot collect all of it at that time, apply a plaster to the eye made of things that soothe eye pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and you are sure there is no hot abscess; then begin again in the manner described before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the compresses:
Mirrors are called "arissati" fistulas:
When you treat it with cautery and with burning sharp medicine, according to what I have said before, and it is not yet healed, then make an incision into the abscess, where it should heal, and remove all the moisture from it, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, then treat it with all the instruments of which this is the form;
and it is called "rough head," and it should be made from iron, pointed at one end, and be pointed like a file, as it is in the present form:
And place it on the area of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the area with drying medicines.
if the area is healed, and flesh grows, and the body of the wound is healed, and it remains this way for 40 days, and it does not regenerate and is not an abscess, and no bad accident comes to it, know that it is healthy;
if not, there is no other remedy than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with an iron instrument, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, you take a drill according to this form, and let the iron point have three angles, and the shaft be tapered to the point as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the entire drill until it pierces the bone, and the patient feels it because wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the area with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter goes to the nose; thus it is a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are fully open, and there is no disturbance to the nose, nor shrinking, then you should bandage the patient;
then you should heal it, then apply leeches or cupping glasses without hurting to suck, then place over the eye a linen made of acacia, aloe, frankincense and gum tragacanth, and then compress the eye and place the poultice over with bandages and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take cloths soft enough, and double each in four, and then place one over the other according to the quantity the eye needs;
then compress it from above with a hard bandage tightly, and repeat the cupping to suck without hurting;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye compressed day and night, and if the poultice softens, you should compress it strongly;
then remove the poultice after the day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, that is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster, bandages, poultice and cupping until it is healed.
from the tearing of a cloth or with When disruptions occur in the cloth or with it, then it appears, and comes forth from the papers like grains of resin, and is frightful to behold;
Then if you see it split, the work is such that you put a needle into the root of the part underneath to the top, then put another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and pierce it, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the cloth around it, and tighten it well, then remove the needle and put on a soaked wool cloth soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread comes away with the cloth, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is constricted by a cloth around each part in a circle, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great appearance, pierce it with a subtle spear that goes deep into the eye, and drain the white moisture and lower the eye, and insert it quickly;
then take it out until it is healed.
This illness, called "alcunnati," is nothing more than a pouch that has gathered in the eye, resembling a descending water, and this is not water;
and the way to perform the work is that you have the sick person sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on two sides, and move it until you see the pouch come up above your eyes; then it be fastened, and it does not descend, and the light is cleared, and the sick person sees things as they used to;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the pouch is not prepared as we have said.
then have the sick person sit between your hands, then take a fine spatula and make a small cut on the cornea along the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the crown, until the pouch comes out;
and when it has come out, then instill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water or fenugreek boiled and honey, then be treated with another treatment until it is healed.
of the waters of the eye We have already mentioned the types of water in the division, and what is necessary to pierce. then work according to health.
You should have the sick person sit between your crossed hands, out of the sun's light, and bind the healthy eye tightly.
then put the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right.
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument called "almagda," or in your left hand, if the eye is right.
then place the point of the instrument next to the crown, the thickness of a finger, on that white part of the eye near the lower eyelid, then push the instrument called "almagda" forcefully, and turn your hand until it pierces into the white part of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and the measurement of the almagda's path should be at the depth of the space from the pupil to the edge of the blackness; and that is the crown of the eye;
and you will see the bone in that membrane through the clarity of the cornea, and then place the instrument at the point where the sharpness is, and press it along one path after another.
if the sharpness descends now, the patient sees before him and the instrument in his eye.
After a little rest, and if the sharpness rises along the second path, apply force with the instrument, and when it is firmly fixed and does not rise, extract the almagda gently by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little bit of gem-salt on the sharpness, and wash the eye with that. Then apply over the eye cloths or wool soaked in rose oil and plenty of egg, and bind it with the sound eye.
We, and those of our time, put on a common bandage with plenty of egg.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, for there are some men who have excessively hard eyes, then you must take the instrument called "alberit," of which this is the shape:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then put the almagda in, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work, prepare a comfortable bed for the patient, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and be free from all movements, and let him eat light foods, and let him not move his head either to the right or to the left, and be bandaged according to his condition for up to three days;
then unbind him in the same dark room, and test his vision, and show him some things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day;
and it is not appropriate for you to do this during the time of treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must delay this, because the inflammation rises quickly.
if a hot abscess comes, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and apply what soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the vision and place a bandage on his face to cover it for a few days, and let him stay in that dark room.
And then let him gradually leave the room, and return to his usual activities;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And a man came to us from Iraq, who told us that in their country, one makes an almagda, through which one sucks out water, but nevertheless, I have never seen any in our land, nor have I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the appearances of the shapes of almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and are properly of brass: And their heads are of the same thinness, and the rear in three sharp angles.
Sometimes there are growths of various flesh on the nose, some of which resemble scorpions with many legs;
and some have flesh that is deeply embedded, of dark colour, and some have soft flesh of good colour. In that one, then, of these soft flesh, and not deeply embedded, you must have the sick person sit between your hands facing the sun;
In that one, then, of these soft flesh, and not deeply embedded, you must have the sick person sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and apply the lancet to that flesh, and draw it out; then cut what you can hold with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the flesh is entirely removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, then treat it with all the fine instruments lightly, so that nothing is left; and if, without overcoming you, or a pus-filled abscess, then treat it as is proper;
and if it is a malignant abscess, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then apply a fresh, sharp, or wine-soaked poultice. If the poultice works, and moisture comes out to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if moisture does not penetrate as it should, know that there is new flesh on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
Then you must put in a rather thick flax thread, and knot it by hand, and have a space of a finger or less between each knot; and the patient should place the thread's head in their nose as much as possible, and pull it, while smelling, until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and many children do so in schools, and it is an easy thing for him who wishes to do it;
Then hold the head that comes through the nose with one hand, and the other head that comes through the mouth with the other hand, and pull one after the other while holding the knots on the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have corrupted the flesh, then pull the thread, wipe the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
Do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of flesh;
and then place a lead strip in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And it should be of silver or bronze, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and let it have a handle at the top to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
from the skin over the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" arises on the top of the nose, and grows and becomes large often, until it is a visible thing to look at;
and for this, you should cut it at the beginning, and remove it completely, then place the cautery or burning medicine on the spot;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, watch out if it is hard, of a foul color, of poor feeling:
if so, do not touch it with iron, for it is a festering abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the sick person;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not foul-colored, and you see that it can be completely cut, empty the sick person and cut it without fear, and treat the spot with dry and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuation comes in one of these cartilaginous operations, it profits little, except in some men.
It is necessary therefore, when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then bring the two edges together with a stitch, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the edges are already separated on one side and the other, you must cauterize all the parts of their edges until they bleed, then bring the two edges together with a stitch, and compress it, and put on powder after powder of dragon's blood and crushed frankincense; and place a piece of strong plaster or other uniting plaster over the powders, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The manner of the stitching is that you bring the solution together: or with needles, as we have said in the stitching of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of abscesses of the lips
To men, there happens within the lips an abscess hard, resembling grains of peas, and smaller and larger;
Then it is necessary that you turn the lips back, and split open each one, and take it with tweezers and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then lift the poultice, and cure the place with dry things until it is healed.
Many times flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus";
If so, you must hold it with pliers and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood run;
then place powdered vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders, on the area;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and often happens, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: if it does not return after the cautery;
Sometimes are gathered at the head of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scabs that are ugly and harsh; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and wormy, so that the corruption comes to the gum, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
If so, you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head be in your lap, and remove the teeth or scabs where they appear, until nothing remains; and thus do with the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other blemishes, until they are cleansed;
And if one removes that which is there at the first occasion, it is good; If not, then begin again on the second day and the third, until you have completely removed it;
And know that teeth require diverse forms of instruments for removal, according to what the craftsman demonstrates, for the rasps with which one scrapes away teeth have other forms than those with which one scrapes between the teeth; And these forms and others should be prepared with you.
It is necessary when you treat the tooth of its pain that you delay in extracting it as much as you can, for this is not something one should do at all; For it is a substance very high until one has no excuse for scraping.
Then, when the patient is forced to extract it, you must be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they believe it is in a healthy tooth, and have the good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of that, until the bad tooth is extracted, for we have already wanted to do so to these people;
And when you are certain of the aching tooth, you must cauterize around the tooth everywhere strongly to protect the gums on all sides;
Then move it with your fingers or subtle pliers in small, small increments until it is well loosened, then hold the pliers firmly; And let the patient's head be between your knees, and hold it firmly so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out, then take one of these instruments and push it in lightly on each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with bandages where the holes are; and hold it gently with pliers so that it does not break when you hold it;
and you must work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, leaving a part of it, so that the patient suffers greater pain from the root's malice than from the first.
And beware that you do not act like ignorant masters, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the tooth, and do not achieve what we have recounted;
but sometimes cause greater illness through the remaining roots, or by breaking the tooth, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is drawn, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if blood flows there, which often happens, fill the place with powdered vitriol;
and if this does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, with which one first moves the teeth, should have long points and large handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the forms: And they should have large limbs, so that they do not bend when pulling, and should be made of good, strong iron, and should be toothed to hold the moving parts.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains when pulling, you should place moistened cotton in butter for one or two days, until the area is softened, then put the pliers, called "algefri", on the site; those pliers resemble the beak of an eagle.
And the teeth should be made like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with those pliers, you must uncover the flesh all around the root and put the instrument called "althali", that is to say, a pick, of which this is the shape:
And it should be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root jumps out with that, it is good.
If not, then use all the instruments, of which the shapes come after:
And if one uses this instrument that has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and other iron tools that are in front, in the manner of teeth, and of this instrument that resembles large pliers, of which this is the shape:
And let these instruments be strong so that they cannot break, and know that many instruments of teeth are there; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and skillful master finds his own instrument by himself, according to what his work and the illness demonstrates to him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of others; and if one breaks a cart or other bones, or if it is possible, then he seeks the instruments that are necessary, which I have told you, and helps with gestures, of which this is the form:
And let them be large and well-fitting to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but that he can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with suitable medicines, and if there is decay in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with all this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to the natural body, and the form is ugly, and especially in maiden women, you must know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and cannot be filed or ground:
Then remove it. and if it is air with the tooth, then take this instrument, whose form is like a small beak, and is of sharp, tempered iron at the tip:
And gradually cut it little by little over several days, because of the hardness of the tooth, and so you don't move the others, and if it seems like it can be filed, then file it with a file like this form:
and is also like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it does not move as much as to break off;
then finally plane it with a file, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, it is necessary to file the sharpness until it is even, so that it does not hurt the tongue nor corrupt the speech.
When the front teeth loosen, whether from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on food without them coming loose, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this does not work;
then they must be tightened with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes.
and let the thread be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
And if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and put it double between the two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you carefully reach the healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the covering until the point where you began, and gently and skillfully tighten your hand until it does not move;
and let your ligature be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them together, and place them between the healthy tooth, and position them so that they do not injure the tongue;
and then leave it tightly in place as long as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, then tighten it with another thread;
if it remains and serves thus throughout its time, and this is the form of the teeth and the way to align the two healthy teeth and the two gums, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, it is put back in its place, time and again, as we have said;
and let no one interfere unless they are skilled and patient, and sometimes a tooth-shaped piece of cow bone is fashioned and placed in the gap, and it is tightened as we have said, and it remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament that comes from beneath the tongue is natural, that one is born with it like that; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the work is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold their head steady, and lift their tongue;
then cut the thick ligament, until the tongue is free from its attachment, and if there is hardness or swelling, and it is from a healed wound, then use the hook and cut wide that ligament;
and be careful that the cut is not too deep, because of the artery that is beneath;
and when you have done so, lift a place of rose water and oil, or of cold water, then put a linen tent under the tongue;
and bandage the patient each night, so that the place cannot heal.
And if bleeding occurs, put powdered vitriol on the spot; and if the blood resists, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see it a different color, black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is a chancre;
and if it is tending toward a swelling, and there is moisture, one should put in a lancet, and slice it with a thin spatula, and release it on both sides; and if the blood resists your work, put powdered vitriol on it until it is stopped, then return to your work until you extract everything completely;
then elevate the injured area with a sling and bandage, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of abscesses of the throat Sometimes there come bumps in the throat called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils; and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then be cautious:
if it is a hard abscess of small size and dark color, do not touch it with iron at all.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the discharge of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will lance it, or it will burst by itself;
and if it is a pale, whitish color, and the root is small, prepare the instrument to cut, but first observe if the abscess is warm and has subsided.
Then have the sick person sit facing the sun, and their head is in your sight, and have them open their mouth and let the surgeon take the tongue in their hands, and press the tongue underneath the entire instrument, of which here is the shape;
and it should be of fine silver or bronze, like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the forceps and place it in the opening, and pull the pus out as much as you can;
and pull out any threads along with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which here is the shape, which looks like a pair of shears; and nonetheless the tips are bent, and one against the other, and are very sharp, and is made of hard iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument present, then cut it with pliers, of which here is the shape: And one side is sharp, and the other side is not;
And when you have cut one of the almonds, then cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, the patient gargles with hot, sharp, and easy water, and if any blood flows, the patient gargles with water, or decoctions of roasted pomegranates, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the blood is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses form in the throat besides the two almonds, so cut these likewise as the two almonds.
And I treated a woman for an abscess that had formed inside her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed the throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained like that for one or two days.
And the abscess had swelled so much that it had forced two veins through the two nostrils.
I quickly then, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out, and extracted a large portion of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue;
afterward I inserted the lancet into the abscesses, and cut away a part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage in the woman's throat was cleared, and she began now to drink water and then wine, and I did not stop cutting at that abscess for a long time;
and the abscess grew again, and filled the space I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I cauterized it and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and do not know what God did to her after me.
of the grape
When phlegm descends to the grape, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is beneath large and round, it is called "grape".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the inflamed abscess is calmed, and it is subtle, then you must cut it.
and the one that is round gathered and is not long; and it is sanguine or of a dusky color or black, then you should avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner I have said, of its whiteness and its length, you should make the patient sit facing the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have spoken before; then stick the hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you should not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you harm the voice and the speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of the cutting, you should use a device for the cauterization of the sense of fear.
And the manner of the cautery is sharp, sharp. And that the patient put their head in your lap, and then press the tongue to the instrument that we have discussed in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with a hot sharp blade, so that it is neither too thick nor too pale; and employ the end of this instrument, of which this is the form:
And have at the head a hollow where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with all the medicine over the sore;
and the patient be lying on their side, so that the saliva and the mucus run from their mouth into the medicine inside, so that it does not descend into the throat, and harm it;
then hold your hand over all the medicine and press it against the sore for the amount of half an hour, until you see it become numb and the burning of the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around any instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton on the wound, until the cotton adheres to the sore;
and do this often, until the cauterization is complete, then leave it to dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to reapply the cauterization with the medicine, reapply it, and after the cauterization, wipe around the sore with cotton soaked in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and be rinsed with cold water, and be treated with gargles until healed.
This treatment is more beneficial than the cauterization.
If it is treated with fumigation according to this method, take chamomile and ysop and origanum and rue and camomile and aron and similar herbs, and mix them all or some of them in a pot, and add water, and boil it;
and the pot should be well-sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot, there should be a device shaped in this manner: And it should be of silver or bronze, and one of the ends should be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the canal, until the uvula is dead;
after that, repeat often, until the uvula dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the hot abscess's onset, for several things happen there; and do not do this fumigation except at the decline of the hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a reed and put a piece of egg-white inside the end, so that the patient's mouth is not too hot; for the egg-white does not let the vapor burn the mouth, and that is a good cure all together, safe.
Many times, bone or fish spine, or some other thing, gets stuck in the throat;
So you should pull out whatever you can see, and press the tongue towards the sun with the whole instrument, so that you see the thing move;
and what you don't see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; Perhaps the air-lodged thing will come out through vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a piece of lettuce root, or a dry piece of bread; and ties a thread to the sponge, and then swallows it; and when it arrives at the place, it will harden, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, then take an instrument of lead according to this shape:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised up; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest the tongue be injured, nor push the bone in;
and it is better that the patient pushes the instrument, so that they may know where the thing is hardened; if it pushes down, or if it pulls it out with the whole instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech of the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the treatment of medicines; and when this does not help at all, then look into the throat of the patient in the sun, then press the tongue with the instrument that I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a very small hook, or with delicate pliers that are suitable for this.
And if that doesn't work, take a thin, heated iron chain, and put it in the throat of the patient, then put a hot iron at the end of the chain, and do this often. And if the patient is feverish all day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with their hand frequently; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it doesn't fall off as we have said, then fumigate the patient with asafoetida, using the instrument I mentioned in the fumigation of the eye;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are glowing embers, and the bottom is covered with a pierced cover, and the head of the instrument is in that hole;
then you place your fumigation in it, and the patient places the head of the pipe in their mouth, and closes their mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but goes down to the leech;
and the leech will now fall off, and if it does not fall off, then repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and dry things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out completely through this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which the leech is drawn out is, when it can be seen, like curved tongs for getting into the throat; and it has the appearance of a bird's beak, and there is roughness from the file, so that what it takes, it cannot let go;
Many are the appearances of abscesses, according to what recollection comes afterward from one and another in this book, and they are diverse in perforation and in size;
and it is in two ways, one of which is in its own appearance, and of what it holds of moisture.
And the second way is for the places where they are in the body.
For the abscesses of the head are different from those of the foundation, and the abscesses of the fleshy place are different from those which come in joints, and each has its own judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that should not be pierced until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
And there are some that should be pierced when they are swollen and do not mature according to their completion, as abscesses that are beside joints.
For when an abscess comes beside the joints, and one leaves it until it is rotten around, perhaps the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Where the abscess is beside the main limb, and if you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the main limb;
where it is beside the foundation, one pierces it sooner than it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a swollen abscess without complete digestion, except the one that is beside the foundation, lest it rot deeply, be prolonged inside, and a fistula results; and cannot heal in a long period.
And you must know the time for the perforation of a ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is calmed, and the fever subsides, and the lessening of pain and redness, and of the throbbing and sharpness of the abscess head, and the other signs;
and you should make the perforation sit where the abscess is most dependent and where it appears soft.
and let the perforation be along the body's length, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all places alike where there is no membrane. In those that bend, according to that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will spread, and it is full of much filth. and perhaps the lips and the depth of it will harden.
And if there is an abscess that is pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And you should apply small incisions to small abscesses. and to large abscesses, large incisions, and many cuts according to the size of the abscess;
and if there are such abscesses where it is necessary to remove the core and cut it out; when it has become like a flap, and is deadened, it is necessary to do as one does for buboes:
and if there are some that are split into three angles, and some that one cuts like a myrtle leaf, as abscesses of the angers;
and if there are some where one makes a round incision, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those that have no head, like a soft superficial abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, do not draw out all the pus at that time, but draw out a part; then plug the abscess until the next day, then draw out some more again; do this repeatedly, gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small children, or old decrepit men. For the spirit sometimes trembles with the expulsion of the pus, so that perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore, approach this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, wipe the wound and observe if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full-sized incision, apply linen or old cotton dressings; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, you must put a dressing in each one so that they come against one another;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have trimmed it around, you must fill it with old cotton or flax-cloth scraps without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood occurs in your work, apply cold water and ease, and wet a cloth, and apply it repeatedly to the bleeding area.
And if the bleeding persists, apply remedies and treatments, and the powders I have mentioned in their proper places in this book.  And if it is during winter, and the area where the abscess is is very sensitive, you must place dressings and cloths soaked in hot wine and oil.
And if it is in summer, and the area is fleshy, you must place dressings soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said.
and then drain the abscess, dry it, and treat it as necessary until it is healed.
And this must be universally known in the treatment of abscesses:
or I have told you how one should proceed in the treatment of abscesses, and behold the chapter here.
Where the head's skin contains small abscesses, and there are types of them that are in tissues, just like the skin of a hen's egg, and many are similar.
There are some that are fatty and others where there is moisture, like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony when cut, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the cutting is such that you test every instrument called "entromissoire", from which the form comes next, what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, you should cut through it along its length.
And when the moisture is emptied, you should scrape off everything without leaving any skin containing that moisture, for it returns often when you leave any behind.
Then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; If not, in vinegar and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; And this will dry what remained from the night.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know for sure that it does not remain from night.
Then treat the wound with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains a thick fat, cut it along this shape, lengthwise. and apply your lancets, and scrape it from all sides, and put all your efforts into drawing out the matter where it lies.
And if the artery opposes you, do what I have told you afterwards.
And also do the same for a stony abscess, in terms of cutting and treating it as I have told you.
And cutting into a stony and moist abscess is easier, because they contain little blood. And if some of these abscesses, on the head, have no moisture, and of these were the abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, and it could not be broken; and if one had struck any of them, one would have inflicted a wound just like from a stone.
In other abscesses coming to the head, except those that come to the heads of children and to the roots of the ears, the opening should always be in the most dependent place, to allow the pus to come out;
and treat them as appropriate.
Many times these abscesses appear on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes come to other parts of the body, and are numerous, and are intertwined with one another.
And each scrofulous sore is properly within its own area, like the boils and abscesses of the head, as we have said; And the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
And the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not wish to obey health.
In those, then, that you see of good disposition to the touch, and are similar to the color of the body, and smooth on all sides, and are not inflamed to the neck's nerves, nor to the artery nor to the conduit, and are not deep;
Then you should cut it open from above, and scrape it on each part, and spread the two lips of the wound with forceps, if you need to, as we have said about head abscesses;
and draw it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and that the instrument is not too sharp or cutting, so that the hand does not slip, and does not go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this prevents you from working, then put powdered vitriol in the wound, or any powders that stop blood, and constrict the wound; and leave it until the abscess is subsided, and the wound is softened, and begins to rot.
And when the blood is stopped, return to your work until you complete it;
Then examine your fingertip to see if any small scabs remain, and cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the base of the scab, you should not cut the scab at its root, but tie a strong double thread around it, and allow it to fall off without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scab, you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch them now, since there is no excess left because of the scab's size. Then you should aim to cut the root, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said.
Then you should aim to cut the root, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said. Those scabs that hold excess, pierce where it appears ripe.
And pierce it thus, as the one mentioned before, by depending, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption. And when the wound is well cleansed, treat it with ointment that causes flesh to grow, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the sore throat. But I have never seen anyone in our land who did it, and this is the record of their words.
For those with quinsy, the slit in the throat, called the "epiglottis", must be healed. and one should not provide help for that, because all the veins and the flesh of the sick person are near the abscesses hot in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the two tonsils.
When the sickness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the death that comes from suffocation.
Therefore, when we want to cut the epiglottis, we must cut it beneath three or four small slits across, between the two rings or by the amount of the slit on the surface, not in the cartilage.
And these places are so suitable for the cutting of the epiglottis that there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far apart.
And if the master is fearful, he must stretch the skin of the throat to the whole width, then cut the skin until he reaches the channel. And drain the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the surface, as we have said.
And it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm from the channel that jumps out through the broken place, and by the lack of voice.
And leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed of which one doubts the strangulation, bring together the two edges of the wound on the skin, and stitch it all together without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasim says that one should not do this until the throat is completely obstructed, and the patient is judged to be dying, and the breath fails. Then the epiglottis is cut so that the patient cannot breathe, and breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three days or four. And then they commanded to stitch the wound and cure it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a lady took a knife and stuck it in her throat, and cut part of the windpipe.
and I was called to cure her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had flowed from it, and I saw clearly that she had not cut any vein or artery except the throat, and wind was issuing from the wound.
I hurried and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and the lady had no further harm than being hoarse of voice, and returned afterward to her usual disposition;
Therefore, I say that there should be no fear of cutting the epiglottis.
This abscess is called "throat hernia," and is a large abscess, the color of a jaundice, and is common in women;
and is according to two manners: natural, and accidental;
where natural has no artifice.
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which one is similar to fat in us, and the other manner is similar to an abscess that comes from an artery in us; and if there is fear, and it is not appropriate to work with violent force except in one who is small, and you must prove and search throughout the entire body: if you find it as if it were fat, and it does not adhere to any vein, then cut it, as one cuts fat, and draw it out with all its covering, if there is any; and thoroughly investigate everything, and treat it as is appropriate, until it is perfectly healed.
Many kinds of fat there are, of which I will describe all the varieties;
and here it is necessary for me to state all the difference that is between fat and issue.
I say that issue is heat and fever-inducing, as long as the boiling is in progress, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and heat subside.
With fat, there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a sac, which is its own pocket and matches the color of the body, and begins like a blister, and grows large;
And they are according to two appearances, either greasy or moist, and many colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of fat, that you first examine and inquire into all the instrument called "entromissoire," according to what its form will be in the chapter that follows.
And the method of inquiring into fat abscesses is that you take the moistest place you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then according to the size of the abscess;
Then withdraw the instrument, and be careful that it doesn't bounce out.
If the moisture flows quickly, whatever color it has, then lance it as I have said for other abscesses;
and if, after the instrument, no moisture comes out, know that it is greasy, then lance it in a cross, and take it with forceps, and lightly scrape it from each side, and watch the area where it lies so that you remove the fat healthy;
and if you cannot remove it healthy, then remove it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the wound returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and compress the wound, and apply soothing things to the hot abscess, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed;
and if the wound is large, stitch the two edges of the wound, and treat it with those things that generate flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary or otherwise, hurry and fill the place with powdered vitriol, and leave it for two or three days, until the wound is rotten, and the blood boils cease. then return to cauterize what remains of the night.
See here the forms of intrumental tools, and they are of three kinds: large and medium and small;
and of these there are three squares called "albaret", and one called "breb", and of these there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, for searching abscesses of fistula;
and they are also like the needles with which one sews the sores, and they are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those that are yellow are better, and they are more tested with black lead for searching the recesses of fistula;
and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the probes are of many appearances, as you see here:
and there are probes that have two bends of three kinds also;
and there are probes that have three bends, and are also of three kinds;
and there are probes that have two bends, and probes of one bend only, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The head of these, with which they are cut, is sharp, and of such there are some that do not cut much more than on one side, so that they scrape the skin, so that they do not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these instruments are the probes fitted into handles, so that the patient does not feel them when opening abscesses;
and are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one does not use them much except on fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and on the buttocks, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, resembling the peelings of nuts, according to this shape, with which one stops blood: and one places it sometimes at the place that bleeds from cuts in the veins and arteries, and sometimes according to this large shape:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to corrupt, so that they appear like women's breasts;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wishes to cure them, it is necessary to do so according to this shape of this line from .b. to .g.: then scrape off the fat, and fill the wound with a medicine that engenders flesh, then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast inclines downward, and is softened because of its size, as happens in women, then split it into two sides above, by two similar splits; so that one is attached to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this shape, from this line .b. until line .g.; then scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitches and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not entirely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come from under the armpits are types of hard scrofulous swellings or they have bumps, and some contain moisture.
Those, then, that contain moisture should be cut along this shape, from line .b. down to line .g.: And when all the pus in the abscess is drained, then fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is like scrofulous swellings, then lance it as we have said in lancing scrofulous swellings, and if the wound still produces pus, then apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin over it is sealed, there often follows abscesses, and the same happens with a swollen vein and abscess.
and if one recognizes it as being due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightening;
and when it is due to the vein, reddish spots are visible;
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and groin and the neck and in many other places, and is very large. Therefore, one should avoid iron treatment, and the chief one should also be avoided, and in those that are due to arterial swelling, one should make an incision above the skin, along its length;
then open the incision with knives, and beautifully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then place a needle underneath it, and pierce it through to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then pierce the area between the two ligatures with a probe until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess will be relieved;
then apply the treatment that creates pus, until the ligature falls off; then treat it with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is along the vein, you must hold with your hand the part of the abscess against the entire skin, then place the needle under the area you are holding, pierce it, and tie it with one double thread, so that you pull it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I told you, with the ligature of one of the two sides to the two ends of the thread;
and if you doubt that the thread will not be strong, you must reinsert another needle into the entire thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tie the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the core and leave what is tied;
then put over it a moistened cloth in wine and oil, then administer cures of poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come to the artery and vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are injured, or through excessive work, and similar things.
And this happens more often to the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a grievous abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in several dispositions without pain;
and when it is squeezed tightly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep within the body, but beneath the skin;
and it moves well from all sides, and does not go forward or backward, or under or above, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with iron: perhaps contraction would result; and that which is on the head or forehead, pierce the skin at the temples.
and that which is on the head or forehead, pierce the skin at the temples. If the abscess is small, hold it with pincers, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it occurs in the belly and nowhere else, a disease called "fungus" because of its resemblance to mushrooms, and its roots are subtle, and its head large;
and there are small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly that resembled fungi more than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had fine roots, and were often split open, and moisture would run from them.
I cut them and found eighteen ounces in one, and six in the other, and the work in the incision is such that you look to see if the patient is moist, and the color of the fungus is white and moist and with fine roots; if you cut it with a wide scalpel, and have the cautery iron at the ready.
if you cut it with a wide scalpel, and have the cautery iron at the ready. For when cutting, there are often too great flows of blood, and if the blood overwhelms you, then hurry to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and afraid of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and tie the fungus with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then tighten it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the fungus, and it breaks off without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is fear of cutting, especially for the belly, but you may well cut it in half, then cauterize it so it does not return;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the tendon which is of a fuzzy colour and poor sense and milky appearance.
For it is an entrenched abscess, and I will come to the treatment of ulcers later.
when the boil is mature If the boil appears due to cautery of a wound or a surface cut, and is on the belly, and some boils arise, as happens in other openings, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is described before, or from wind;
And if it is from a surface opening and the boil's discharge, then the color of the abscess resembles the body's color, and it is a slight thing without pain, and has a varied discharge. And if it is due to the bowel's discharge, then it is more varied, and when you press it with your fingers, it yields, and then returns, and perhaps it is hard, and it greatly enlarges at the entrance to the bath and from strenuous exertion.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a slight thing, and appears clearly when you press it with your hand, nor does it constrict.
And if it is due to blood, then the large and hard abscess appears with these signs, and is fixed according to a quantity; And if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you examine whether the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or vein, or wind.
And if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you examine whether the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or vein, or wind. Then you should leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I have told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or bowels, you must instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie perfectly still, then mark around the wound; then instruct him to lie frequently between your hands, then go around the area you have marked with a spatula, then extend half of the abscess above the large incision; then bind it around with a strong thread, or a strong silk cord firmly, and let the wound be free from the bandage;
then open the half of the extended abscess over the bandage, and put your index finger in, and seek the intestine; if you find it caught by the bandage, untie it, and put the intestine back outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, take it with the incision, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein causes you difficulty, go around gently, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles around what you have made in a cross, where you made it pierce;
then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh will fall away by itself; or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said; and remove the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as necessary, and close the wound.
about a chancre We have discussed the types of chancre, and how one should treat them with medicine, and how to avoid treating them with iron;
and we say that the chancre grows in the flesh, and there is great care in its treatment, and the ancients said that when a chancre is in a place where it can be scraped away, like a chancre on the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, and it should be entirely removed when it is in the beginning;
No one has ever healed one before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile several times;
then make the patient bleed if there is a clear fullness, then make the patient lie in a good place to perform the treatment;
then remove your lancets from the ulcer and cut away the edges from all sides, and remove the bone from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow freely, and press the area well with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood causes a problem with the incision of the artery or vein, cauterize it until the blood is stopped; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already discussed the different types of dropsy, and how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type, and the treatment with medicines, and the treatment with iron:
and one should not use iron in these two types: that is to say, tympanites and yposarche, for it is a fatal thing;
Therefore, when treating this type of dropsy called "sunstroke" with medicines, and the treatment is not effective, observe if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as looseness of the bowels and similar things; if not, do not use iron, for there is danger;
and if you see a patient of strong constitution, and they have no illness other than dropsy alone, and they are neither too young nor too old, then you should proceed as follows: Lift the patient upright in your hands, and the attendant presses the abdomen, pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spatumile spine according to this form: And let it be sharp on both sides. pointed, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestines when inserted, and cannot injure them;
then see if the dropsy is located towards the intestines: if it is, you must cut above the belly in three straight lines under the knife; and if the dropsy is due to liver illness, let your cut be on the left side of the belly in three lines;
and if it is due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and it is not appropriate for the patient to lie on the incision so that excess fluids do not flow to that weak spot;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and cut it, and lift your hand across the entire space between the skin and the surface, as if skinning it, the thickness of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the surface until the fluid reaches the empty space, and that is the space of the water, then drain it, and insert this instrument of this shape: And it resembles a fine silver chain, and is of brass or light bronze, and has a small hole on the underside; and on the side of one part, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is cut like a feather, and that is the shape of the incision with which the scribe cuts the feather:
on the head above is the alemele, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it descends immediately onto the instrument;
empty then a half or a third, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient dies from the resolution of his spirit from the arm, or he falls faint, or he approaches death;
but empty according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's virtue signify, and his pulses;
then pull out the instrument and retain the water, and it is now retained by the heart that stops the opening that is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then restart the instrument the other day, if you see the patient suffering this, and draw a small quantity of water;
do this for some days, and beware of overdoing it until there remains only a little water.
And if you doubt about the patient, and leave too much water, cure him with a hot grave or sand, and by much sweating or baths and the sun, and let him drink; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healthy, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
If it is necessary, quickly pierce it with a very thin needle according to this shape:
then place a thin lead plug in the opening, and tie it, and keep it thus for three or four days. And when he wishes to urinate, remove the plug, and let him urinate, and then replace it.
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes to flow will not allow it to remain closed.
Those whose opening is small, are treated with a lead plug, as we have said, and it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in their proper place are injured, for some are born with the opening at the head of the penis, so that they cannot urinate unless they lift their penis upwards. and cannot ejaculate because the substance cannot reach the testicles, and that is a serious illness.
And the manner of the work is that the patient lies often on his back, then stretches the head of the penis and cuts it as if the size of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should.
And beware of the bleeding that often occurs, and if it happens, stop it with something that stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Many times these sores appear on the penis, and it is an unsightly appearance of flesh.
and some are malignant and some are not.
If so, you should take them with a fine needle, and cut and clean all of them, then put moistened cotton with Egyptian ointment on them; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the sore is malignant, with a foul color and odor, then you should apply cautery to it.
When you have cut it, and if the sore is near the penis, and a part is inside the skin and a part outside, you should remove the part of the sore that is inside first; and when it is closed, treat the part outside.
For if you treat them together, the penis is not sufficiently sure that it will not be pierced, and blackening and corruption will come to the penis and the testicles;
so you should remove all that which is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate bark and figs, then treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood comes, apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cauteries help two conditions together: that is to say, to the flow of blood, and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, then you must insert a lead cane into the penis, and the patient urinates through it;
and when the skin is inflamed on the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens due to a wound or abscess, then you must cauterize it with a pointed instrument, until the adhesion is broken, and the head of the penis is freed from all sides;
and if it is a serious matter to discuss these things, you must cauterize a small area on the head of the penis and the skin;
then carefully separate them and place a thin, damp linen cloth soaked in cold water between them so that it does not inflame again.
Circumcision is not simply a separation of continuity like other wounds; However, when we perform this operation, voluntarily, and especially on children, it is necessary that we perform the best and least painful operation for healing.
I say that the ancients did not prescribe circumcision for their children, for they do not practice it in their law, and we only have what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the majority of masters and lords who performed circumcision using a knife, and with force, and a whole new instrument.
If the skin is pierced, because there are two layers, and perhaps one layer above is cut, and the other below is left behind. Then it needs to be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and the cleansing that results from the incision doesn't reliably remove the point of the limb.
And with the cleaning of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and the wound worsens, and many times heal without needing further cleaning, and I have seen it.
Of the cleaning done with force throughout the entire length of the thread, I have found the usefulness of the experiment, for force cuts precisely as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, it cuts equally in one continuous stroke. but let the thread be tightly wrapped around the skin;
and let the manner of the first operation be such that you make the child think, if they understand, that you are only tying the thread around the stick, and then let them enjoy it in every way you can;
then hold it between your hands straight, and place the forces either between your hands or under your feet so that the child cannot see them, nor any of the instruments;
then place your hand on the rod and blow on it, and pull it up until the head of the rod is straight. then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered, then bind the marked place with a double thread, then bind it under the first bandage.
then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered, then bind the marked place with a double thread, then bind it under the first bandage. and hold it with your two fingers (index and thumb) by the second bandage, and cut between the two bandages, then quickly lift the heart from above and pull the head of the rod. then let the blood run drop by drop, for that is the cure. and place powder on top, and on top of the powder a layer of glue made from a boiled egg yolk diluted with rose water, mixed with good fresh rose oil, and leave it there until the next day, and cure it with other remedies until it is healed.
The form of the forces for cleansing is this:
the two blades should be sharp and the blades should also be as large as the handle equally.
The error in cleansing occurs when the heart is inside the incision.
Then you must extend it to your fingernail, lest the place become an abscess.
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it to your fingernail, then hold it with pincers and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and that which is beneath the rod is swollen, let it be until the hot abscess is calmed, and lightly scrape it.
Cut it as best you can, and be careful of the part of the rod, this will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with medicinal powder for wounds, as we have said in the treatment of powders, and if one cuts too deeply into the heart and it goes upwards, it will not harm at all.
Then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the retention of urine
The retention of urine is caused by obstructions from stones, or congealed blood, or pus, or dead flesh, or similar things, as we have said in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone lodged in the bladder's neck or opening, then the patient should be bent over their knees. And their feet should be placed on their back, and the patient should stretch their abdomen away from the back, and the patient should restrain their breathing as much as possible. And then the bladder neck is forced to expel the stone above, so that the urine is released.
And if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
And it should be of fine, light silver, like the feather of a bird. And it should be a palm and a half long, and slender at the head.
And the method of releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a bit of wool or cotton to the end, and put the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut the excess wool and place it up to the tip of the syringe, then grease the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and lubricate the bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently place the syringe on the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then pull the penis upwards towards the pubic area;
then insert the syringe forward until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it coming down to the empty space, and this is not done according to this method unless the channel it travels through is twisted;
then pull the thread with all the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then remove it quickly, and make the urine flow;
and repeat the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When sores or blood comes into the bladder, or putrefaction is gathered there, and you wish to distill there acids and medicines, do so using the entire instrument called "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three openings: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the channels through which the medicine flows should be such that they tightly seal the urethra without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture, and push it in when necessary;
and when you wish to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the tube into the moisture, and draw out what is within;
so you will draw out the moisture through the tube, and then push the medicament strongly inside; so the medicament will enter, and will go to the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and that is the form of the subtle clyster used to clyster the bladder:
And it is of silver or of a metal, and the head is higher;
and underneath, by the breast where the ligament falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put the moisture in it with which you want to clyster the bladder, then tie it between the two breasts using a good double thread, and warm the moisture a little over the fire;
then put the head of the clyster into the tube, then hold your hand over the bladder to allow all the moisture to flow in, until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder;
and if you don't have a bladder, take a piece of parchment, and make a circle, and pierce it round about; then put a strong thread into these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a tile, and put in it what you want of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones, and the extraction with accompanying medicines;
and have described the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in what stones one should operate with a knife; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that stones formed in the bladder more often occur in children, and this is a sign that the urine leaks from the bladder, similar to water in its subtlety;
and it shows as gravel, and the patient scrapes his penis, and it often hangs down and then stiffens; and from much of this leakage the foundation weakens;
and the healing is easy in children up to four years old, and is very difficult in the elderly, and is moderate in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those with large stones than for those with small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the waste that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and raise and move him downward, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes comes from a higher place;
then make him sit between your hands, prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely tilted downward;
then search for and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut on the stone.
And if it does not fall out upon touching it at all, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young man; and put it into its base, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, then draw it towards the neck of the bladder;
then press on your finger, and push it out to the spot where you want to cut.
And order the attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to extend his right hand upwards towards the nipples, and with his left hand remove the skin beneath the nipples in the area where the cut is to be made;
then insert the scalpel, the shape of which is like this: And cut between that which is between the nipples and the fundament, not in the middle, but on the side of the left groin;
and it should be straight over the stone, and your fingers should be continuously on the fundament, and the cut should be transverse so that it is wide at the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure of the fingers on the fundament will cause it to jump out without difficulty;
and know that there are some stones where there are angles and edges: so it is hard to remove;
and there are some that are smooth, like a ball, and round, from which removal is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it doesn't come out, you should grip it with tongs that are like a file on the top to tightly grip the stone so it doesn't escape; or you place underneath it a slender, curved instrument at the head;
and if you can't extract it that way, widen the opening a bit, and if the blood flows freely, restrain it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first remove the largest one to the neck of the bladder, then cut above it, then pull it out forcefully, and the smaller ones afterward if there are more.
And if it is very large, it must be softened, and a larger wound made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine comes out frequently because the opening cannot close;
but nevertheless, strive to pull it out, or to break it with pliers, until you pull it out piece by piece;
and when you have completed your work, then fill the wound with incense, aloe, and dragon's blood, and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then bind the patient's neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you loosen it, thoroughly wash the area with oil and water, then treat it with diafine ointment and basil ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses occur in the wound, and corrosion, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is retained by this, which is known in such a way that it is without discharge with the urine: Then insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will corrupt the bladder and rot it;
then clean the wound with water, and vinegar, and salt, and aid him in all the ways that you know, until he is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you bind his two thighs together, and assemble the medicines upon the place.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the passage of the penis, and fixed inside, and the urine cannot escape; If you treat it as I have said before, that you cut it many times, you are excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven it thus.
Take an iron implement according to this shape and let it have three angles fixed in a triangle.
Then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
Then insert the implement into the penis gently, until it reaches the stone; and turn the implement in your hand against the stone bit by bit, until you can pierce the stone from the other side;
Then the urine will come out immediately, then press your hand on that which remains of the stone that is inside the penis. Then it will be broken immediately and will jump out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
And if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the point of the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the frozen blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
Sometimes a stone is lodged in women, and if it happens, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
One is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will expose herself to the examiners, especially when she is chaste.
And the third way is that perhaps one cannot find a skilled woman in this art of hands;
and the fourth way is that the woman's stone is deeper than the man's, so a deeper incision is required, and there is great fear involved. And if necessity calls for it, you must take a skilled midwife, and they are rarely found; and if you do not find one, you must seek a subtle, skilled midwife;
and present a wise woman experienced in women's lives, or a woman who knows part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command of the examination of the stone; and carefully observe if the woman is a virgin:
and carefully observe if the woman is a virgin: then she should insert her finger into the foundation and seek the stone;
and if she finds it, she should constrain it under her finger, and instruct her to insert her finger where the patient is, and seek and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, she should move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut on the stone at the root of the thigh, opposite the middle of the groin, where it appears prominent, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then insert the instrument into the incision, if you feel the stone, widen the wound until the stone can come out forcefully, and know that there are many types of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have ribs.
so know the appearances in order to know the outcome.
And if the blood overwhelms you, put powdered vitriol in the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone comes out forcefully, and have the instruments that I have told you about in the extraction of stones, to help you in your work.
and if the blood overwhelms you, and it's from an artery that is cut, put the powder on the place and bind it with bandages and do not begin again on it, and leave the stone and do not remove it, lest the patient die. then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood has subsided, and the area has calmed down, then return to your work, until the stone is expelled.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white pus, under the skin of the testicles, which contains the egg;
and is called "pus," and sometimes it is properly in the tissue of the egg, so that one might think it another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white pus that we have mentioned;
and this does not happen often. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: where it is a color declining to yellowness, or it is without red, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs of recognizing this assembly, for if it is as white as we have said, the abscess is round, slightly long like the shape of an egg, and the testicles are not apparent, because there is moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper tissue, the abscess is round with a part of the egg, and for that reason, one thinks it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white surface, one feels it well.
Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, try throughout the entire cavity, of which the form is mentioned before. According to this, then, which comes after the cavity, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, the patient must be bled according to their ability and the fullness of their body.
Then lay them on their back, on something a little high, and put many cloths underneath them;
Then sit on their left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs near the heart of the testicles;
Then take the lancet, and cut the skin of the testicles along their length, down to the edge of the knife, and make your incision straight, dividing the skin of the testicles until you reach white tissue, and peel it carefully according to your ability;
Then pierce the white tissue with a wide hole, and draw out all the water, and then put your hooks, and pull the white tissue upward;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the white tissue; cut it all or in pieces, even the side of it carefully, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle moves outward during your work, then return it to its place when you have completed the work on the white tissue;
then stitch the two ligaments of the heart of the testicles together, then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another ailment, you must tie the vessels that support it, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle from the entire supporting structure, remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if an acute [condition] is assembled into two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part as you did the first one, then wipe away the blood and place moistened wool in rose oil on the wound;
then cut the other part as you did the first one, then wipe away the blood and place moistened wool in rose oil on the wound; and place more wool moistened in wine and oil over the two testicles, and place doubled cloths on top of that, and bind it using a bandage according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with wool strips according to this resemblance, and let them be joined together by stitching at the crotch of the breeches, and one of the cloths should be placed over the buttocks down to the back, and the other to the groin area;
and the other two ends over the two ankles, and let the entire binding be gathered in the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this wound is treated with cautery instead of iron, and that you should take a thin knife cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and it should be heated as we have said, so that the white surface that contains the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that surface with the prongs, and scrape it with this hot thin cautery:
And scrape it in all the ways that you can, until you remove all of it;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this work is more healing; and take precautions against blood flow, and against the work of cutting;
and if anything opposes you, whether an abscess or blood flow or anything else, then cure what opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to endure this work because of its horror, then perform perforation, as I tell you, and when you are certain by the indications we have described that water is the problem, seat the patient on a raised chair; then pierce the abscess on the lower part with a wide, long spear; and place the perforation in the long part of the body;
and let the opening be wide so that all the moisture flows out;
then place cotton on the area, and bandage it, and allow the remaining moisture to drain, and then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the moisture to exit through the wound, then you must insert a reed or the instrument used to draw water from hydrotics, whose form is described previously;
and enlarge the wound, and know that the moisture returns, and is gathered after six months or so, and when it is gathered as before, then the patient will live his days.
Know that in the section of this treatise there is fear in many dispositions, therefore it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone;
and I will tell you the work and the appearances of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses come upon the body, and especially to the testicles; and that is by many cases.
That is to say, by acrid and sharp superfluity, which is spread to the testicles, or by percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and finds no pain, and is a grievous abscess;
and perhaps is a grievous, fearful, and painful abscess, and of a dark color, and sometimes comes from the rupture of an artery, or from the swelling of a vein.
When it is by rupture of an artery, it is known by the disposition of a hot abscess when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it.
The one that is made from the swelling of a vein is known by its disposition in response to the pressure of fingers, and one can well make the incision on this kind, and on other tissues; and it is that you cut the bottom of the scrotum, then lift the testicle upward, and draw the white part of the skin outward, and free the supporting structure from all sides of the testicle.
If the testicle is already swollen with its surrounding tissues, then it is necessary that you pull the testicle and cut it;
And if it is swollen on the surface, or within the vessels, then you must free all that membrane and cut it smoothly.
And if the origin of the tissue is in the back, you must cut it all and remove the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess wrapped in a swelling similar to a boil, along with softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he moves.
And the treatment for this illness is just as dangerous as the previous one, and nonetheless we will tell you the method, according to what the ancients did.
You should make the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the suspender for the testicles down below your fingers, at all the vessels close to the penis, and the masters should hold it, and stretch it firmly.
Then, with a sharp, wide spatula, cut across the vessels until they are uncovered, and then scrape from each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
Then insert a needle where there is a double thread, and tie it to the first place where the wound is, and tie it again to the other end; Then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and pull out the corrupt moisture;
Then treat the wound as the others, where pus is generated, so that no vessels leak which nourish one of the testicles;
For by this, no harm comes, and if blood comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove the testicles from all the vessels; So that the testicle does not lose its nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and dry up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this condition is due to the rupture occurring on the surface, or to stretching on the abdomen in the groin area, because the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
And this rupture is either of the surface, or of its stretching, and these two types arise from many causes:
or from a blow, or a jump, or a fall, or the lifting of heavy loads, and by similar things;
And the signs when it is due to stretching of the surface, are that it occurs little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; And the abscesses are even down to the bottom, because the surface presses on the intestines.
And the sign when it is due to a tear in the surface, is that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess appears differently, under the skin, and this is because of the escape of the intestines and the body fleeing from the surface.
And sometimes the coils of the intestines descend, and are caught, and cause great suffering to the sick person, especially when they are pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, for which they must be avoided.
And the method of the treatment is that you instruct the sick person to return the intestines to their place with their hand into the wound, if they can be returned. then they should be placed on their neck, between your hands, and lift the thighs;
then extend the body upwards, and cut all the skin from the testicles lengthwise; then insert levers of the size needed to open the wound, so that the pus can escape;
then scrape the surface beneath the skin of the testicles until the hard white surface is exposed on all sides;
then place your index finger into what lies behind the testicle, in the area between the white surface underneath the skin of the testicle and the second surface, and separate what is behind the testicle and between the second surface;
and then pull with your right hand into the body of the testicles, and extend the white surface upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle across the entire surface towards the waist; and instruct the assistant to extend the testicle upwards, and loosen what is above behind the ligament;
and search with your fingers if there is any part of the intestine wrapped around the hard white surface, and if you find anything, place it back inside the belly;
then take a needle or a thick thread made from many threads, and place it in the back part of the surface, which is after the skin of the testicles; after the waist, then cut the ends that appear of the threads, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the surface, which we said is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong bandage of two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter, and that a festering abscess does not come; and put the bandage again according to the first bandage, long two fingers from it, and after these two bandages, leave the surface of the area under the skin of the testicles the width of a finger; and after all the rest, according to the roundness that the testicle has;
then cut in the area beneath the skin of the testicles, as long as the blood runs, and the boil, as we have said before;
then apply wool soaked in oil, and put it on the wounds, and apply the bandage that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white surface that we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, out of fear of blood running. For this happens many times, and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, it should be warmed with hot water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this treatise, I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the treatise that is along with the vision, in such a manner that you tie the vessels, after the incision above or slightly below;
then cut it in half and treat the abscess of that which opens, until the vessel falls out;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs within the veins, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the testicles, and if any do descend, it is little, and repairs itself every hour;
and yet if it remains too long in this condition, the wound or sore grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens through the stretching of the sore on the veins, as we have said, for it stretches, then softens and swells the place and opens it;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the place of the broken swelling of the width according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then pull out the sore which is under the skin that surrounds it, then take the reed and place it over the exposed place of the sore;
and press it into the depth of the belly, then close the two visible places of the sore over the head of the reed, and stitch each one;
then remove the head of the reed, and do not cut any more of the sore nor stretch the egg or anything else, as I have shown you in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
then treat it with the treatment for wounds. And when you cut the threads, cleanse it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The sore is confined, and has no appearance in the rupture, and the cauteries are milder in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the nipples
Many times the skin of the nipples is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and is easily seen;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one lay the sick person on his back, and cut the softened skin over the natural skin;
then bring together the two edges with a stitch, and if you wish, first stitch the excess softened skin with three or four firm stitches;
then cut between the stitches, and treat it like other wounds until it is healed and the thread falls out.
of chastity
Know that chastity is prescribed in our law, and for that reason I would not speak of it in this book;
and is necessary only for two reasons:
one is that the master should know how to respond when asked, and know the cure;
and the other, because we often need the chastity of certain animals to help us, like goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say therefore that chastity is done in two ways: or by pulling, or by cutting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the beast sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging; then grasp them in your hand, until they are reset and you no longer feel them.
Of the castration of the groin: You must restrain the beast, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory, and cut each testicle in one stroke, when you have well scorched them;
and leave no bit of the surface and the subtle surface which is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is milder than that done by pulling, because with pulling, perhaps something remains of the testicles, causing the beast to desire lust;
then cure the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears also the form of a woman's nature, or there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and they have a penis like a rod and two testicles.
And the treatment of the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and treat them like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tentigene is an added flesh upon the natural part, as long as it is too unsightly to look at; and some women have it as large as a hand, and that is the cure.
You should trim the excess tentigene with your hand or shears, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest bleeding occur, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed;
and another flesh that grows at the mouth of the wound, filling it, and possibly bursting forth, and is like the shape of a cow, and for that the ancients called it "cow-disease". If necessary, you should cut it, as we said for the tentigene, and treat it until it is healed.
Erratic it is when the nature of the woman is not perceived, or the opening is small; and is caused by birth, or by accident due to illness that has come to it;
and is caused by birth, or by accident due to illness that has come to it; or it is due to added flesh, or thin or thick skin, and is made deep in the belly, or in the sides, or underneath, or wherever;
and hinders conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the ability to bear flowers;
and the knowledge of these is by the examination of the swelling.
If the numbness is close and apparent, search with your fingers or a stick.
If it is of thin skin, and it is close to the two lips, be quick, and do it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and let the woman lie on her back, her legs spread apart;
then stretch the two lips widely, until the thin skin is round, and the numbness is released;
then take wool, and soak it in oil, and put it on the spot, and let the woman lie on her side every day, so that it cannot close up.
And if the skin is hard and thick, you must cut it with a scalpel, in a shape resembling myrtle leaves.
If the numbness is of a new wound, then suspend it from a hook and cut it;
and have blood-stopping medicines, such as dragon's blood, frankincense, mixed with a drop of egg;
then apply a wide lead strip so that the wound cannot close;
and let it remain for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
And when in the flesh there comes a new wound, it must be cut according to this manner, unless it is an entrenched abscess. For an entrenched abscess that is in the flesh, one should not touch with fire.
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when hemorrhoids are old they become swollen.
And we have already discussed the varieties of them, and the signs, and I will now describe those that receive a cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and swelling, when they are deep within the flesh, and are not apparent to touch, then the cure is not by fire.
Those that are at the surface of the flesh, which can be felt, are those which can be cured.
Therefore, you must place the woman in a cold room, then grasp the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then powder upon it medicines that restrain blood, such as alum and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then put her feet against the wall for an hour, then place her in cold water;
and if a discharge of blood comes, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and gall and similar things, and then take barley flour and mix it with honey and oil, and make a poultice upon her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, then apply leeches to the back and breasts without hurting them;
Then take wool and soak it in plantain juice or elder juice with old wine, and apply it to the place.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and the one called "albathir" is red, and is like a harsh swelling, so it must be cut like I said the boil; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many types of abscesses occur in the body, such as chancres and stony abscesses, herpes, esthiomenes, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and hot abscesses, and many other illnesses that I have described in the division.
It is therefore necessary that I describe in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the body, which is not among the abscesses that gather pus;
and if you wish to know the treatment with iron, look to see if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red, you can see it. Then do not rush to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is calmed;
and then make the sick person sit on a seat, and let them have two small stools where they lean, and rest on their back and bring their feet together away from the leg;
and let their thighs be spread out, and place their arms under their knees, and tie them well with a good bandage;
then suck him/her (the patient) from the direction of the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the sore, of which the form comes afterwards;
and it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the sore, so that what enters the instrument does not go any deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the sick person; and if the instrument is larger, then it is necessary to cover the depth of the sore with cloths, so that the instrument does not hurt him/her;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is open, and one cuts it with a soft hand, then it must be cut at the head, at the level of the soft spot;
And when the boil is emptied, it is necessary that you place moistened cloths in rose oil, or in dry green oil, in the wound;
And place the cloth deep into the wound, and place over the sore and over the incision clean wool soaked in water or cooked mallows;
then treat it after two days of appropriate ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes one cleans the sore and the wound with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water or roots of lilies and aristolochia longa that have been cooked; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is renewed in the sore, you must avoid cauterizing with iron, but treat it as we have said in the division.
of childbirth It is necessary first for the midwife to know the nature of natural childbirth, and its signs are when you see the woman pressing downwards and desiring to smell the air:
then the child hastens to emerge. Then know that this childbirth is according to natural form, and the issue is under its head, and the afterbirth with it.
And when you see these signs, you should gently press her belly so that the child emerges quickly.
For when it descends beneath its head, the afterbirth emerges with it, and the mother is rid of her superfluities by a good cleansing.
And that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes upon its feet, and the body or head, or hands, come forth, or it comes upon its belly or sometimes, and is perhaps turned upon its neck, and by other bad positions.
Therefore, the midwife must be wise and skillful in these matters, and guard against error and deception, and I will show you all the positions, how one should assist her.
If the child comes upon its head by natural birth, and the woman is laboring hard, and her strength is weak, then have her sit on a stool, or the women hold her.
And apply warm oil or fenugreek, which has been cooked, and then the midwife should place the small spatula, of which the shape is described here, between her fingers. and separate the afterbirth, and cut with a fingernail as much as the moisture within has been forced out.
and grasp the woman's abdomen until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then the woman must be given an enema of fenugreek with sesame oil.
Then have her drink and sneeze with a concoction, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour. Then the child will now come out.
And if the two hands come out forcefully, you must gently reset them little by little. And if they cannot go back in, place the woman on a seat and raise her feet up. Then lower the seat to the ground, and hold the woman so she does not fall when it is lowered.
And if the hand cannot go back in, and the child dies, then cut off the hands with the knife that is mentioned above, and extract the child, and reset it similarly.
from the exit of the child from between her feet When the child comes out from between her feet, it must be pushed upwards. and then turn it gently, little by little, until it is even.
Then take it by the feet and extend it gently.
If it jumps up to the thighs, instruct it to grasp and make it sneeze with force. if it leaps away, if God wills.
And if it does not leap away as we have said, then turn it gently, little by little, until it is in its natural position. For then it is easy.
And if it does not leap away as we have said, then take a mixture of aloe, and oil of sesame, and melted gum, and grind all together in a mortar; and put this ointment on the affected area of the woman and cover it up, then make her sit in warm water up to under her ribs;
and when she is softened underneath, apply a poultice of myrrh and place it underneath, and leave it on for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and pinch her mouth and nose, and gently press on her stomach, for the child will leap out now.
from the birth of the child onto her knees When the child comes in this form, the midwife should gently place her hands on it; then be wrapped around her neck, and her feet hanging down, and lie on the bed; and gently fold her hands, and then press her hands onto her stomach, and remove the cushions underneath, until she is ready to give birth; and if the child does not move, grasp her feet and move them forcefully, then move her stomach upwards, then place your hands on it; and bring the child out gently; and instruct the woman to strain until the child comes out.
from the child's emergence, which comes from the wide part, by one hand; it is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, have the woman get up and walk;
if she cannot walk, have her lie down on the bed, and straighten her legs firmly;
then administer the poultice that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, have her sit on the seat, then try to bring back the hand; and hold the child according to the natural form, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to hold on until the child is expelled.
of the child's exit from her neck, and have her hands spread out, and her face turned toward her mother's back. It is necessary that the attendant hold her hand, then turn it slowly, and hold it gently;
and when it is equal, put on the natural mucous membrane of the upper and lower parts, as we have said, then instruct her to move gently;
and when you have done this, make her sit on the seat, and instruct her to hold on; and make her sneeze. in this same manner for the entire second part.
in this same manner for the entire second part. When it comes out in this manner for the entire second part, cut the second part with your fingernail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the infant hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the breast, so that it is not held back, and the infant dies;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and instruct the woman to take it some times:
of the birth of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, and it rarely happens. Two are a strange thing, and do not live long;
Two are a strange thing, and do not live long; I know that they are multiplied, and are separated by a membrane that divides them, which is attached to the womb;
and sometimes they emerge as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they emerge painfully, the treatment is as we have said, and let the delivery be subtle, and do quickly and easily what she does; and do thus as it merits for salvation. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb in I or II or III or IV or V or VI or VII, or several up to XV, and are completely formed in the form of a child by the measurement of the wise glorious, and it is necessary that the midwife know all of this, for perhaps such a thing happens; so do according to what is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat the woman of the dead child or womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained by manual work; if it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or she fears death;
if it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her shoulders inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the minister should hold her in two parts, or she should be tied to the bed so that she is not dragged down by the child;
then rub the mouth of the sorrow with moist oils with the mucilage of aloe and fenugreek and flaxseed, then anoint her hands with these oils and these mucilages;
then put them into the sorrow gently, then look for the place where she puts the hooks that are suitable for them, and watch if the child is ready to descend upon her head;
if you place the hooks in her eyes or her neck or her mouth or her palate or under her chin or in the throat or near the ribs, and if the descent is on the feet, then place the hook or lancet in the mid-ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the hook in his right hand, and place the curve between his fingers of his left hand, and gently place it with his whole hand, and insert the hook into any of these places that we have mentioned, until he comes to the empty space;
then insert the other hook, or the third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then extend it equally by moving from one side to the other, to make it come out, and let the hooks be toothed to hold it, as is the form here:
And if part of it remains, then grease some of his fingers with oil, and put them on that part, and pull the other part;
and if any remains, then place this hook in a higher position, and do so until it comes entirely out.
And if one hand comes in front of the other, and it cannot be brought back due to constriction, then you must wrap it in a cloth until it comes entirely out; then cut at the joint of the sole or with a knife, and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the passage is narrow, or if it has a sharp point accumulated on the head, then you must place the pointed spatula between your fingers, and cut the head and remove the point; or you round it with the instrument called "almidach", from which the form comes with the instruments or chapter that is after this one;
and likewise do if the child has a large head naturally;
and then pull the bones with pliers, and if the head jumps out and it is pressed by force, it should be cut open, so that the moisture which is in the pus is released;
and if it cannot come out, then cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture flows out.
And if the child is on its feet, the pull is gentle, and the straightening to the mouth of the wound is gentle.
And if it is tight in the belly or in the breast, you must pull it out with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and cut the belly or the breast, until the moisture within flows out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, the attendant places their hand deep into the wound, and pulls it down to the mouth of the wound; then puts in one or two hooks, and pulls strongly;
and if the mouth of the wound is contracted due to a hot abscess that has arisen there, one should not work on it, but rather apply moist and greasy things; and apply poultices, and soak in soft and moist water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can place it upright, apply what we have said about the living child;
and if one does not have the strength, pull it forcibly in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, apply what we have said about hot abscesses that arise in the wound;
And if a discharge of blood comes, it should be placed in constricting water, and apply other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another placed on top of that one, and the other died as well. After a long time, an abscess developed in the buttock, and swelled until it opened, and began to discharge profusely.
I was called to treat it, and pondered long, and could not close the wound.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and from it came one bone, and after a few days another. I marvelled greatly, because the belly has no bones.
I thought it must be the bones of a dead child.
I probed the wound, and drew out many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time like that, and a little pus would come out from the place;
and I have recorded this chapter only so that when the master finds a strange thing, he might know how to provide assistance.
Following this comes the form of the press, with which the books were made;
and with two turns at the two ends of the two leathers. However, the horns should be finer than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and let the mouth of the tube be one finger wide, and the margin of the wood one finger, and in length one palm and a half; and between the two leathers should be two joinings of this same tube, which should be fastened to one and the other, half a palm in length or a little more;
and these two fastenings are placed in the mouth of the device to open when the two horns are turned.
Another form, similar but finer and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, resembling tongs; and have at the two ends two fastenings, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you wish to open the device with the entire instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, feet dangling and legs open, then place the two joined fastenings into the device, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then operate your hand on the entire instrument, as you did with the tongs similarly, according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the device, until the woman does what she wants.
These instruments are all mounted, and their forms are multiplied; and when the mirror has been prepared, the work is quicker, and more difficult for men due to their quantity.
Do not despair of the instrument until you have prepared it, for their necessities are not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, you should instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a stimulus, and hold her hands over her mouth and nose; and if she jumps because of this, good.
If not, she takes a pot and makes a hole in the lid, and puts herbs in it that can open the woman's womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in water over the fire;
then place one end of the cane into the hole of the pot, and the other end into the woman's womb, and hold it until the vapors reach the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. Then the afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out easily, instruct the woman to wet her left hand in oil of sesamum or in the juice of elder, and then place it in the natural opening, and seek the afterbirth; and when she has found it, she should take it and pull it gently and straight, so that the woman's womb does not rupture during extraction;
but it must be moved slightly to the right and left, and then pulled; it will come out and detach itself.
And if the passage of the womb is very constricted, we have described the treatment of sneezing and the fumigation of herbs;
and if it is not cured by all that we have said, take care not to overdo the pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the opening of the womb, you tie it to the woman's thigh, then give her a clyster of four-ingredient ointment; if it will rot and return, and will become strong;
However, when it rots, a foul odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Therefore, appropriate fumigations are needed for this:
None of the ancients have tested fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates a woman for the retention of flowers and afterbirth is this:
And it is of a similar shape to a chain, and one places the thin end in the nature, and the wide ends over the fire;
And let the fumigations be over the embers, and the scab until it is gone, and begin another one.
Many children are born who do not have the foundation pierced, but have a thin plug stopping it. Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that plug with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and to take care that she does not touch the bandage.
Then put moistened wool in wine and oil, then apply the ointment cure until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will plug up again, place a lead chain in the opening and leave it in place for several days, and it should be removed when the child wants to go to the chambers.
And sometimes these blockages come from the closure of a wound or an abscess; If so, that closure must be cut. if it is cured, like we said about the lead chain.
Fistulas that come from under the fundament are swellings, and the enlargements that come from beside the fundament, or in the space between the two parts, have one or more fistulas;
and when that swelling is old, it opens, and often has a white or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating;
and are recognized by the fact that there is either expulsion or flatulence when the patient expels, and perhaps a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that penetrate to the bladder, and to the middle of the penis; and reach to the hip joint, and to the bottom of the thigh.
And thus one recognizes a penetrating fistula at the foundation, and not a non-penetrating one: and it is that you place your index finger on the foundation, and insert a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then insert a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and it does not come from a perforation, nor wind nor pus, as we have said: know that it does not pierce; therefore hurry in your cure.
And when the fistula pierces to the bladder or to the conduit of urine, then urine leaks out, and cannot be sealed by medicine.
If it pierces to the hip joint, then the tendon reaches the place; if there is no twisting and the source of the pain around it, then it often boils out, and no medicine or ointment is of any value to seal it;
and in these piercing fistulas there is no cure other than labor, and the vanity of foolish pretenders who meddle with them.
In that which is not piercing and is not ancient, there is hope of health through iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands;
and the patient lifts his legs up to his thighs, and has his thighs inclined to his stomach; then place a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is twisting, until you know where the tent comes.
If the patient feels it around the foundation, then you must put your index finger there, and then feel if the tent has pierced it;
and if you feel between your finger the surface or the flesh, then know that it is piercing; if you do not work at it, it cannot be healed.
However, it is said that some can be healed, but this happens rarely;
and the help that is done is that the subtle cautery is heated according to the width of the fistula, as it has been said before; and place it hot into the fistula, until it reaches the base; and do this two or three times, until you know that these protruding flesh parts have been burned, which are similar to a bird's feather;
and then treat with moistened cloths in butter, until the flesh part comes away, then treat with an ointment to regrow flesh and close up.
If it is thus healed, that is good.
If this, otherwise cannot be healed;
and if the cloth goes between, and does not pierce the finger that is at the foundation, and between your finger and the cloth is a thick covering of flesh or skin, and you see the fistula at this point which is under the covering of the heart; if you cut the beginning of the fistula, and push the cloth forward, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the head of the cloth; and the cloth will be delivered, and will fall;
then clean those misplaced flesh parts that resemble a bird's feather, and nothing remains.
And if the blood overcomes you, and runs between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine.
For cauteries with fire bring together two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added flesh, and the stopping of blood and the drying of moisture;
then cure with tents soaked in butter or pounded herbs, until the place casts pus, and so the burned flesh departs into the pus;
then cure the wound with ointments that consolidate the hard flesh, and these medicines are dry.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula goes down to the bottom, and is far from the body, put your finger in the bottom and explore it.
If you feel the tent, and between it are cloth or a scab or flesh, where it is close to piercing, there is no recourse but hope and expectation, by the administration of one of the three ways:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, put tents in it and cure it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the tissue holding the bottom, and the flow comes out without your will. then cure it, as we have said;
then cure it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and cleanse it after it is cut near the bottom, either with a tent or another suitable instrument; then cleanse that bruised flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula on the part outside the bottom:
then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula on the part outside the bottom: it will be a lighter thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are according to this manner: and it is when you place the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the bottom next to the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the head according to this shape: And put one thread twisted in two, and put the tent with all the thread into the fistula until it is at the head.
If it is piercing in the margin of the bottom inside, then pull out the thread of that hole, as you place your finger in the bottom;
and pull the head of the thread, and join the two heads together, and tighten one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, so that the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and it falls away;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in all the ways you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not appropriate to make the lacing cut so deep, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatumile spine, with which one makes the fistula, is very sharp on one side and cutting. and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are within the fundament, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and often blood flows from them, and there is one or more of them, and they are under the fundament and at the head of the fundament;
but those that are outside have little moisture, and often a little yellow water or a little blood, and they have the color of the body;
and the cure for those who have them within the fundament is that you instruct the patient to strain himself to go to the chambers, so that the fundament issues outward, and the thread appears; if you hurry, and hold it with tongs, or you hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then he takes them with a cloth, or with cotton, or a piece of chamel; and draws them out with your fingers, then cuts them, and powders them with some hot powders that are in the place of cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then cure them with other cures until they are healed;
and if the fundament cannot come out, then you give the patient a mordant and harsh clyster to wash what is in the fundament, so that it may come out openly; If the patient complains, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is light;
If the patient complains, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is light; and you take them with your nail or with pincers, and cut them, then cure them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they dread the incision by iron. If it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
If it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: Take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then draw the thread above and pierce the needle on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and remove the needle, and do likewise with all the others, and leave one to run the excess blood;
then put over the base a damp cloth in rose oil or in cerote, and put it over the base, and command the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they are fallen off, then treat them with ointments and other remedies until they are healed.
of the drying of the wound or base Many times there is drying of the wound in the intestines, and due to constriction of nature, and when the sickness is old and medicine is of no use. If it is necessary, use the point of a spatula or your fingernail to scrape away the scab, which should not be allowed to moisten; then treat it until it is healed as is proper;
and if it cannot heal, repeat the scraping more forcefully than before, until it is quite inflamed and scabbed over; then treat it until it is healthy.
there is tremor. Formice is a small, false appearance around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes the cold is found, and it is felt like a tremor of death, and it comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is that you take a stick of a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that stick over the tremor, so that the circle encompasses the tremor entirely. then turn your hand around the entire stick until you cut around the tremor, and push it deep, and eradicate the tremor from its roots.
And if you wish, make one of bronze or iron according to this shape, and let it be slender below and tapering above: not piercing, to hold at the finger, and to press.
And if you wish, cauterize the tremor, as it is described before in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or gold, or of molten or hammered bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small or large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those, then, that are administered to the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small.
Those, then, that are administered to the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is thus wider at the top, where the belly is bound in this manner:
and there is a separation where the belly is bound, as you see, and the clyster is pierced inside;
and have two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and let the belly, where the medicines are placed, be of an animal's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and have between each hole one space, then insert into these holes a strong thread of twisted or knotted thread, and assemble the belly as if it were a goat's; and when the medicine is inside, bind it with a strong thread to the instrument beforehand, then administer the clyster;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or similar substance, then insert it gently; then the minister squeezes it with both hands together, until it is all empty, then remove the clyster, and the patient raises his legs to the wall, and if the medicine wishes to come out, let him hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps soundly one night, it is a greater aid.
And if you clyster him in a disease of looseness of the belly, and the medicine is quick to leave, then repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or abscess, let the clyster be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster, upon which the leather should be tight:
We have already said in the division the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the treatments of hands and medicine, according to the fulfillment.
I say that wounds are diverse according to what they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and of what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing stones, and cutting with swords and knives, or spears or staves or arrows, or similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, like a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure of each wound, and will begin with simple wounds of the head, for the memory will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, take care if it is from the throwing of stones or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rise of a hot abscess: if you immediately make it bleed from the cephalic, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side of the injured part;
and keep the patient from overindulgence in wine and heavy foods.
And if it does not wish to bleed, let his diet be reduced, and let him drink no wine, nor eat any meat;
and put on the wound, if a hot abscess comes there, cotton soaked in rose oil only, or in astringent wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, place on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood and it has not been affected by the air, the powder that I will describe a little later;
and if the burn has affected it, apply some ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like a sword cut and similar, and the edges cannot be brought together with bandages, bring them together by stitching, as I will describe for wounds of the belly and the chest.
If the wound is open to the bone, and is hanging, and only holds by a little, cut it off. then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard material in place of leather, and instruct the patient to eat hearty foods, such as bread and cooked wheat, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the leather, and it does not reach the bone, cut away all the rot, and burn it, then treat it.
and if there is an artery in the wound or vein, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicine, tie the artery, and if you find it loose, bind it with a thread; and if this does not help at all, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and it is that you should put this powder on it so that the burn has healed.
And the manner of the powder is: take frankincense one part; dragon's blood two parts; live charcoal three parts, and powder it finely, and fill the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bandage it well, and leave it without loosening, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses charcoal alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but that the burn has not changed the wound.
And if the burn has changed the wound, especially if it has festered, then one does not put this powder in it;
but puts on some digested ointments, or powders of barley flour made from water and honey, until it casts off pus; then treats it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with subtle pincers;
and I will tell you about fractures of the head afterwards.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs on the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is severed.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and not to put anything constricting on it, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is also with the brain, which is the highest member;
but the medicine should be soft, like warm water in sweet water, and mixed with rose oil, and boiled water also in sweet water, and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, stitch it and bind it with bandages, then let it heal until it is sound.
And if the wounds are deep and she is festered and full of pus, pierce it in the lowest place;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding occurs, tie it off, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine in the throat is cut, or the heart, and the conduit is protected, through which the food passes, stitch the heart to the throat's lining, and do not touch the throat but restore it to its natural shape; and then restrain its movement, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, probe it; and if there are pieces of bone, remove all that you can, and those that you cannot get, leave them until the wound becomes purulent, and the exit is freed and lessened;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle the powder I have mentioned on it. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, see if gas escapes from the wound as the patient breathes: Then know that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put powder on it immediately, nor bind it tightly for the blood not to linger deep and return to the heart and kill the patient; but put an attractive ointment on it, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, put old cotton in the wound to soak up moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three, or four, or more days; so there will be no spasm, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction of the vein; and when you see good dispositions, know that the wound is saved. Then treat it with poultices and other remedies, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and it opens again, know that there is a fistula;
if you treat it as you should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and it is simple, or on the side or back, treat it as you would a wound on the front. if it is large, with stitches;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is close to the bone, and has broken pieces, then cauterize the wound and draw out the fragments if they are separated; and if they are not separated, let the wound fester, which will ease the extraction;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The rupture of the belly is large, medium, and small;
From the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, leap out, causing their intrusion.
and the healing is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because one must more painstakingly return the intestines, if one does not return them immediately.
Because the intestines swell as soon as they feel cold, they are more difficult to return, and thus a medium wound is worse, because it is harder to return the intestines to their place than with two others.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
The two common healings occur in the healing of the belly, and the healing of other wounds of the body, and two other proper healings are common to other wounds.
And nevertheless, they are more proper with the healing of the belly, and I will say each one and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to return, this is by one of the two manners: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water, or boil it in water with vinegar and cypress and spice, and warm the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes use a constricting wine, and it is better than water alone for swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, moisten the intestine with water, or boiled elderberries and mallows, for by this the entry is eased a little;
and if it cannot enter, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, which no one should perform without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
so cut inward into the bend and not outward, and see here the shape: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine jumps out, return it according to its natural form to its proper place, if you have the power, for this is worth a great deal.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, you must make the sick person lie on their back, and put their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly, place the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and likewise, if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, make sure that the wounded part is higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in wounds, great and small.
In small wounds, apply what you have prepared, then take a compassionate assistant who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common way of sutures, and it is that you take a needle or several, according to the extent of the wound's width, then leave a space of one finger from the beginning of the wound, and place a needle or a strong thread there; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the subcutaneous tissue, which is beneath the skin, until you have pierced that part, and bring the two edges of the subcutaneous tissue together;
then draw a double thread around the needle from both sides, then bring the two edges of the wound together, and then leave a finger's width of space, and place another needle there;
then tie the thread just as you did with the first needle, and do not stop doing this as many times as you need needles until the entire wound is closed.
and let the needles be medium, between fine and coarse, for fine needles cut all the flesh, and too coarse ones cannot enter properly: Therefore, they must be medium-sized;
and you must not push the needles too far into the flesh and skin, so that they do not cut and worsen the wound before the closing;
and then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and put bandages or strips on the needle ends to keep them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles are sufficient.
The second method is common, and involves bringing together the two edges of the leather and the two edges of the fabric with a needle and a strong, medium-sized thread;
And when you have pierced all four edges together, bring the needle back to the point where you began, in the manner in which cloth is sewn;
and put space between each stitch the thickness of a little finger;
This method is known to men, and I sewed a wound a man had in his belly, which was cut by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm in size, and intestines were showing, about two palms in size, and the wound was in the middle of his belly.
I repositioned the intestine after it had been out for 24 hours, and the wound was sealed by the 15th day, and I treated him, and he was healed.
And the doctors had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle.
And I did not treat him with any ointment, for I was in a place where none could be found, nor any other medicine; and I would put old cotton over the wound twice a day, and wash it with honey water until he was healed.
Or I shall tell you the two proper ways of stitching:
Take the needle, and push it from the outside part to the inside one;
when it has pierced the heart of the right into the right, then leave the head of the thread or stitch where you have put the needle, and make it pierce from the inside part to the outside;
and the understanding of this stitch is that you sew just as the leather-workers sew hides, and that you leave the thread once on one side, and take it up again on the other, until the stitching is completely finished.
The second way of stitching, which Galen properly calls, is like some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and apply one of the thread's ends to the other end, in this manner:
Insert a needle into the nearby thread's head, and pierce that spot only, and leave the two ends of the thread; Then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside, to the two ends of the thread;
Then pierce each one from the outside to the inside, into two other thread ends that are on the other side;
And that is the better way of stitching and the most common.
Galen says this, and some testify, that one should sew the belly with two needles, or with a thread in each;
And one should insert one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew leather straps;
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
And it is that when you find the wound fresh, with all its blood, before the burning has changed it, you reposition the intestines and sew them;
Then apply powdered, healing earth, and if the burning has changed it, then apply any ointment available until the wound heals; And stitch the threads, and let the stitches be fastened and the wound healed; Then treat the wound like other wounds until it is healed;
And if you have no medicine, then as soon as it begins to heal, place old cotton on it and move it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in many cases when wounds are simple;
And if you fear that the wound might spread to the main limbs, then you should soak light wool in tempered oil, or rose oil, and put it around the joints and under the armpits;
And if it feels pain or rot in the boils, which often happens, then douche them with heated dark wine, especially if the rot reaches the intestine;
and pierce it; and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine called "jejunum" cannot heal when wounded, and this is due to the abundance of veins in it, and the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the splinter jumps out of the wound, return it as you would the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and turned black or dark, you must bind the black area so that blood does not flow, for there are veins and arteries there;
then cut what is between the bandage, and hang the two ends of the piece from below the wound to the outside to make the extraction easier when the splinter comes out, and the wound heals.
of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is torn, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and it became swollen and turned into a fistula, and expulsions and flatulence came from it;
I applied treatment according to what I could, and I did not cease to care for it until it was healed, and the place was stitched up.
And when I saw it healed, I feared that the patient would have pain in their belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some experimenters said that when a small wound is in the intestines, it should be bound in such a manner: take a piece of lint with large ends, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the lint has opened its mouth, place it over the two edges, so that it binds its mouth over;
and then cut off its head, and this is held so that it cannot unbind itself, then place another piece of lint afterwards in the same manner as before, until the wound is entirely closed; and stitch the wound.
This head will burn inside the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can bind the intestine with a thin thread that is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
Take the end of this intestinal thread, which should be very thin, and then tie to the end of this thread a thin twisted linen thread, then put the thread into the needle, and stitch the intestine, and pull it through the rupture;
and this manner of stitching with lint is no stronger than according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the large intestines, there is no device or skill, other than subtlety.
of fistula or where it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes chronic, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it is ragged and full of pus.
And a fistula, according to truth, is a hard and white knotted swelling, where no pain is felt, and is also ragged like the feathers of a bird;
and sometimes clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes small, and other times considerable;
and I have spoken of this in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and where there is no flesh, is no different than one of the eight causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or due to its malice; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, that does not allow flesh to grow; or if there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the material is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a type of pestilence; or because the property in the region is slow to digest, and health is delayed, and swells by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Or it is necessary that I make you know the cure of fistula which is done by the work of hands.
Know that fistula occurs in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that come from large veins, and arteries, and nerves, or to the surface, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and some come to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this nature are difficult to heal, and there is only labor and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not come to the place I have mentioned, and you are confident of the cure, and you want to know it, take a tin or iron tent, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, seek it with a thin lead tent, for lead bends easily around the twisting;
and if the fistula has many holes and you cannot easily seek it with tents, then irrigate it through one of the holes, for the moisture flows from one hole to another, and cleanse it;
then carefully search to your ability, to know if there is bone or nerve, and is deeply rooted, and carefully ask the patient about the pain they feel when you press with your hand, and the place where they feel it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or in any of the places I have mentioned, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove completely the foulness and the corrupted flesh that is within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is deep and directly located, you must cut deeply as far as you can, then place softened medicinal tents in sharp medicine, and place them up to the head of the fistula, so the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that encourage healthy flesh, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not trouble or affect the main limb, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then scrape it until the corruption is entirely removed, then treat it with things that promote flesh growth until it is healed;
and if it does not heal, and returns to its previous state, know that you have not yet reached the source:
then uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, that is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep for you to reach; if there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with pincers, then pull it out with an instrument suitable for it, and if there are many bones, then pull them all out, and leave not one;
and if the moisture resists you, and there is no error or fear, then cut through moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, then place something on the wound that causes rot, and leave it until the place is rotten around the bones, and then the bones will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as of the leg or thigh, then simply restrain the corruption until the blackness is entirely removed, then restore the wound;
and if there is a large part of the corrupt bone, and it reaches down to the marrow of the bone; then it must be cleaned and cut all the way down to the corruption, and then healed until it is joined together;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example and help in your work.
He was a young man around 30 years old, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, until the matter came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and had no reason to avoid opening;
but the physicians in their folly worked so hard that the abscess opened, and a lot of matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many openings came that all emitted pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians applied treatments for around two years, and there was no wise man in the art of medicine, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which they treated him, and what flowed through the openings to a large extent; and the young man's body became red, and had a yellowish color.
I placed a tent in one of these openings, and then searched all the openings, and found that one came against the other from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the openings until I uncovered a portion of the bone, and found it corrupted and pierced, and the corruption reached the bone within.
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except for the one that I took away.
and began to restore the wound with quick medicines for a long time, and it could not heal.
and then I started again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued into the bone, and I removed it, and then took it away, and I tried to mend the place. but I could not, until I cut around a palm's breadth of the bone, and the wound was throughout its marrow, then I restored it with medicines. and it was healed and mended quickly, and it was not necessary to start the work again except for the weakness of the sick person, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had of him. For due to the blood evacuation, he often gasped, but he was completely healed, and hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and it was of good disposition and had no harm nor contrary in any way, nor to the air nor to coming.
And if the bone is broken in any place of the body, it must be treated in this manner: Take the splint, and fasten it to the head of the exposed bone, and command someone to extend it upward; and place another bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage, and place it over the flesh which is on top of the bone, and extend the head so that you draw the corrupted flesh underneath, and uncover the flesh over the place where you want to be, so that the splint does not cut the flesh;
and place a cinder or a plank underneath the bone to help cut away the corrupted flesh;
and it must be done as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and be done again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part, then uncover all the flesh;
Then place a cinder underneath, and then splint from one part to the other the corruption, and let the splint be the length of the corruption a little, as we have said;
And if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and splint the bone where it is on the other side;
And if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut it;
And if the corruption is in the nail of the hand, or in the nail of the foot, that is a very strong thing, but nevertheless you must inquire into that corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way you can, but do not let the vein or nerve oppose you;
And know that the instruments and tools for cutting these bones are numerous, according to the position of the bones and the appearance of the flesh, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; And for that, it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument for each type of work;
And know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the ways of illnesses; So consider the instrument you need according to what is appropriate.
The shoulder might dislocate either due to internal causes, or due to external causes;
And when you have treated that corrosion with medicinal cures, and they are of no use, then it is necessary to cut that limb down to the place where the corrosion begins, so that the patient escapes death, or the worse evil, the loss of the limb;
And the sign is that the limb turns black, so that it seems burned by fire, and after the blackness, the corrosion spreads from limb to limb, and attacks the whole body;
If you hasten to cut, and if it is due to the bite of venomous creatures, such as sea scorpions, vipers, and similar ones, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off and do not allow it to spread to the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
And if it reaches the arm, cut it at the elbow;
And if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no strong remedies are of any use against the extent of its power;
And do just so when the corrosion comes to the foot: If it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint;
And if it comes to the foot, cut off the entire foot; And if it ascends to the leg, cut at the joint of the knee;
And if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the sick person to die;
And the method of cutting or severing the limb is that you bind it above and below, and let one assistant pull one of the bindings downward, and another assistant the other binding upward, and you separate the flesh between the two bindings to a space of one span wide, until the bone is exposed;
then cut or sever it, and place a strip of linen on each side, so that the severed part does not touch the healthy area, and bring no further injury and abscess to the sick person.
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some restraining powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
he suffered a blackening that seemed like a burn from fire, and this corrosion first appeared on his toe of the foot, until it affected the entire foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off the foot, and was healed;
and a long time later, the corrosion returned to the toe of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repelling things after cleansing the body, but the corrosion could not stop;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, for I had hope of repelling the matter; and I feared also that if I cut off his hand, he might die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have not written this except so that others may do the same if there is need.
Sometimes an abscess arises in a fleshy area, and remains so long that it gathers a large amount of pus; and then it bursts and the pus escapes, and the area remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin on top is as thin as fine linen cloth, and does not reach the bone, nor the nerve, and such an illness is called "sore," and not called "fistula";
but if it extends so far as to reach the bone deep within, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you should cut the skin all around, especially when it is thin, like a linen cloth; and it does not heal from its corruption.
And if you have confidence that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a clyster in this way:
Look to see if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes out has a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is made thus: Take lard, and oil, and litharge, likewise, and put it in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
And then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and clysterize the swelling, and tighten the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by pressing;
do this repeatedly, until the swelling is healed, and the foul odor is removed;
and sometimes, if this medicine isn't available, a clyster of water and ashes is used.  Take ashes from a vine branch, pour water over it, then strain the liquid, and use it as a clyster, until you know the swelling is clean;
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then use a clyster of water and honey, with a little bit of ground litharge in it; or you can use a clyster of honey and wine mixed, because the honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine dries the swelling;
and when you have done this, and are certain that the swelling is cleansed, then use a clyster to encourage flesh to grow there.  Take a diaphanous plaster, made with rose oil and wine;
or you can use clysters and ointments, whose properties I have described in the section on ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the nozzle of the clyster cannot enter, then enlarge it slightly with an iron instrument, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment or basil ointment until it is widened;
and if the wound is too large, sew it up, leaving only the space where the clyster can enter; and if the opening that discharges pus is on top, then cut it lower than where it is.
and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, prepare it in such a manner that the pus flows to the lowest part possible, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, prepare it in such a manner. that the pus runs easily downwards, and leaves nothing of the pus;
that the pus runs easily downwards, and leaves nothing of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to put on the swelling, and spread linen cloths over the entire swelling; then cut as necessary in the spot of the swelling, a little wider than the first, then spread a soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it on the opening of the swelling to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days once;
and the one that is over the opening of the swelling, remove often to remove the pus, and know what comes from the pus, whether it is venom or little or enough, or digested or indigested;
and watch if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has spread in this way and you see the nature that rises on the opening of the swelling, then know that the swelling is already healing, and health is approaching;
and then loosen it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you loosen the wound, change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health is approaching.
For there are men whose wounds take a long time to heal, and some that do the opposite;
And if indigested pus leaps from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal;
And if the swelling is slow to heal and is prolonged, add drying medicines, moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as ointments, as is defined, for there is a great deal of vitriol, and this is the last medicine;
Take ointment defined, and they make it with rose oil, and they sprinkle it with equal parts of old wine;
then they apply it and use it;
and that same thing does better to a swollen boil, when defined ointment is not present, or you take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and grind it, and powder it over honey when it is over the fire;
and then stick it to the flap, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes a long-stemmed aristolochia and roots of the celestial lily, which is also like the flour of vetch and centaury; and use it as simple or compound remedies: grind them, and make powder, and put over the honey I have mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged and is not cured by this remedy, then know that the corruption is deep and has made an impression on the bone, or in the hard tissues, or in the ligaments; if the cure of the fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the finger or toe, or perhaps arises on other fingers;
and when it has grown old, and one does not take care of it, then a foul abscess arises, and it runs and casts pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and perhaps even corrodes the entire nail;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, until there comes a putrid pain, and the finger is swollen, and the color is dark.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, you must cut away all the excess remaining of the nail with a sharp instrument, then cauterize the wound afterward. Cauterization is very helpful if the bone and nail are healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, you must place a support under the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it upwards, and cut the flesh subtly and gently, and put burning and corrosive medicines on the remaining flesh to remove it all; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corrosion is in the bone, cut it and remove it forcefully, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger becoming corrupted, cut it in a V shape as previously described, and then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is struck and bruised, and it feels great pain, you must first drain it;
then cut the skin of the spathula with a sharp blade across the top, and watch that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, put something on it that soothes.
The swelling that arises in the hands of some men by chance is all fleshy, and sometimes there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them arise at the base of the joint, or the origin is in some of the fingers.
Those that arise in any fingernail do not move, and those that arise at the joint of the finger, perhaps move.
The size of the fleshy one is slight, in this manner: Cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Those that arise at the base of the joint are difficult to cure: So hold it with a cutter.
For one that arises at or near the back, you must first cut the flesh round to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable blade, and then treat it until it is healed.
The inflammation that comes to the fingers together arises from a birth defect, or from a wound, or from a burn, or from similar things.
You must cut that inflammation so that the fingers return to their natural shapes. Then place between them cloths or bandages moistened in rose oil, so they do not rejoin. or you put between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed as is fitting.
If inflammation comes to any of his fingers with the palm, cut that inflammation as is fitting.
Veins are large swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in many members of the body;
and more so in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you should administer a purge of phlegm to him, and then cure him with the basilica.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you tie the vein, and draw it completely out.
The incision is according to this method: first, heat the leg with hot water very strongly, until the thick blood is thinned, then compress the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places, with a wide incision, then raise and draw out the black blood into your hand, from one end to the other, as much blood as the patient's strength can tolerate;
and then bind it, and instruct him to eat foods producing black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and harms the patient.
The lifting of it is according to this method: raise the patient's leg, if it has much hair, then put it in a bath, and warm the leg with hot water until it turns red, and the veins swell;
and if you have no bath, then heat it by fire, and then cut along the vein from the length to the knee cap, or in the part below the ankle;
then scrape the skin with a knife, and peel the vein from each side, until it appears when it is felt;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it appears like a white string;
then put the lancet underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then gently cut it with the knife, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then peel the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the lancet, as you did before, and cut it with another lancet, as you did at first;
then make another incision, or more if necessary, then lift it, and cut it at the toe of the foot, then pull it and lift it down to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then insert a strong double-threaded needle, and tie it, and pull it, and put a lancet underneath, and turn your hand back and forth, until it comes out; and be careful that it does not cut, for if it cuts, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and harm comes to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, put wet wool on the wound's place, soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, twisted, and wrapped together, and is not straight, as we have said, then you must carefully split it, but do not cut it; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vein is curved, and does not cut straight, so as not to cut the vein;
and is of a large curve, for if it were slender, it would cut the vein, but be thick as we have said, and this is the shape:
This vein is embedded in the legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and in dry earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the rot that comes under the skin, as it comes into the body of serpents and worms, embedded between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes into the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you should wrap a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces around it, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging on the leg, and every time a bit comes out, wrap it around the lead, and tie it.
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it is all out. for if you cut it, it will return into the flesh and cause an abscess and rot in the place, and a bad illness.
for which reason it is necessary that it be treated little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body.
And sometimes this vein, when treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man came to me once, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, it pierces one inch or more, and pierces it to the bottom, so that everything comes out.
And let the matter within be emptied, and administer healing medicines to the place to prevent any rot for some days, then treat it as abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it opens at the joint of the foot, or on the foot, and many holes appear in it, and branches come out from it.
Then treat it as we have said before.
of worms that grow between skin and flesh This illness is called "ox-disease" in our land, because it happens often to oxen, and is a small worm that grows between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, and one can feel it well as it moves from limb to limb, as it gnaws at the skin where it passes, and causes wounds.
and is engendered by the corruption of certain humours, like worms and serpents and leeches and ascarides in the belly;
and one fears its malice, for when it travels through the body, and ascends to the head, and it reaches the eye, perhaps it enters and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you wish to cure it and draw it out, one cannot do so except when it is moving:
so it is necessary that you tie the location above and below with a strong band tightly, then cut above it and draw it out forcefully, and if the worm is deep within the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire above, until it dies;
and the greatest harm it does is that it damages the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming towards the head near the eye, press down on the eyebrow firmly below it, then cut above it, and draw it forcefully out;
and it is necessary to use the patient with body cleansings of dissolving medicines for the bad, festering humors, and abstain from foods that cause putrefaction.
of the pain that comes from windiness This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in some limbs, and can move from limb to limb;
and I saw those things that I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of her arm;
and a little later, I saw it ascend like a worm to her shoulder, faster than anything, like quick silver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran throughout the whole body, until it reached the other arm;
then she told me that it circled around her body repeatedly, just as I saw it.
I greatly wondered how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this sickness in this manner. However, I had seen many others whose pain had moved from place to place, but I had never seen it like this, as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a thin body, and exposed veins, and for that reason the constriction appeared.
and it does not appear according to this reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and filled veins.
And when you wish to treat this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, quickly release it above and below, and then cut until the constricted wind in the place escapes; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, treat it with things that expel wind, like foul-smelling pills, and serapin pills, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearance and according to the places of the body where they strike.
The diversity of them is that there are some with large points, and small, and barbed, and barbed; and some with two angles, and some with tongues, and some with pieces;
and those that strike any limb strike in two ways: or in principal members such as brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it falls then in any place of these members, and the sign of death, which I shall tell you afterward, appears to you: so it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of this arrow, for death comes afterward in many conditions; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deep, then pull it out and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain, when the arrow strikes and pierces the bone, and the surface tissue above the brain is torn, are when there is blindness and stiffness and dizziness and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps there is a leak of fluid from the nostrils, or the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and from the wound leaks white fluid resembling pus, and also burns away flesh;
and if these signs appear, then desist from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not embedded.
The sign of an arrow striking the heart is that it is near the left breast, and feels as if it were lodged in hard, and not empty, matter; and perhaps the arrow moves as if the pulse does, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat come, and fainting occurs: Then know without doubt that death will follow.
And the sign of an arrow that has not pierced the lung is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient's complexion changes, and sighs heavily and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the chest covering, it is beside the small ribs; and causes great pain and sighs heavily; and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something of undigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and some straw spurts from the intestines, there is no hope for treatment, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts out and flows, and the patient feels severe pain: know that the wound is fatal.
Other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, shoulder joint, spine of the back, arms, thighs, and legs, and similar limbs, are saved according to various conditions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not poisonous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do the same.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of his nose: I tried it, and drew it out on the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I pulled out an arrow that struck him in the fat of the eye under the eyelid, and the arrow was bent, and I could only reach the tip toward the shaft, and the arrow was large from a Turkish bow, with all the light iron without feathers.
The man was healed, and no bad accident befell him.
And I pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arab with feathers:
I cleaned the beard, and worked delicately until I pulled it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I pulled an arrow from a man, which had struck him in the belly, and I thought he would die;
and then after thirty days had passed, his condition did not change at all; I cut around the arrow, and extracted it, and pulled it out, and there was no bad outcome.
And I saw a man whose arrow had struck his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural disposition, nor did it find fault in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, whom an arrow struck in his face, and the wound was closed; and remained thus without suffering great pain;
and many others like them.
And he extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had lodged in the middle of his nose, and it was slightly leaning to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had been lodged for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very thin probe, and did not feel anything; and it felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the point of the arrow. I put an attractive and digestive plaster on the spot, so that the area would not swell. And the arrowhead's location appeared to me.
And the arrowhead's location appeared to me. I applied the plaster again and the wound healed again, and the patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead inside his nose one day;
and he told me so. I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound repeatedly, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow protruding at the spot;
then I added more of that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound, until the arrowhead became clearly visible;
and the wound took about four months to heal, and then it widened so much that I could use pliers, and pulled it one way and the other, and it still wouldn't come out;
then I continued to refine and devise new tools, until I found the right pliers, as described later in this chapter, and with them, I extracted it, and healed the wound.
And the doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound closed, and the patient was completely healed.
Now I have told you about the nature of extracting some arrows, so that you apply your treatment to what I haven't said, because the book cannot include everything;
but a wise master looks closely at a small thing, and at what is present and lacking, and devises new work and new tools, for the unusual things that occur in this craft.
I say that arrows do not leave the limbs where they are lodged except in two ways: either through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and the one that jumps out through the place where it enters, that's an arrow lodged in fleshy places, and sometimes jumps out immediately.
And if it does not jump out immediately, then leave it until the surrounding flesh has softened, and the exit has become easy;
and if it is lodged in the bone, and it cannot emerge, then leave it for a few days, and move it every day;
and then it will jump out, and if it does not, then pierce around with a very fine drill, until the surrounding area is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged in a hidden part of the body so that it cannot be seen, then search for it throughout the wound; and if you feel it, then extract it with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein, then enlarge the wound so that it is large;
and extract the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has prongs by which it is held, then remove the flesh that is stuck on both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the prongs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful not to break the arrow, for that would make it harder to pull out.
And if you cannot do it in one go, then leave it until the surrounding area is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood causes you difficulty, then apply what we have said about the treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and vein, and devise how you can safely remove the arrow, whether quickly or slowly, firmly or gently;
and place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow entered him, for this is the greatest help there is; and if you cannot, then place him according to the signs that show you.
The arrow that comes from another place, or where something of it appears, or the skin is swollen in a place where it is clearly seen or felt:
then cut around it, so that the pliers can grasp it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out now.
And if it is held in the bone, then turn your hand round and round, until it enters the bone, and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it for a while, and then resume pulling it out until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is in there, then push it out with the entire shaft;
and if the shaft has fallen out, and you want to administer a push, then administer the instrument with a point, so that the tip of the arrow enters the point of the instrument;
and then push firmly, and if the arrow is pointed, then push the instrument with a pointed end into it, to make extraction easier.
And if the arrow is embedded, then you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as appropriate.
And if the arrow lies in the groin or the belly or the bladder or the ribs, and it is close, and you can cut above it, then cut above it;
and beware of cutting the vein and the nerve, and then pull it out, and then stitch the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which arrows are extracted are similar to a bird's beak, and see here the shape:
And there are many types of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the arrowhead is also like the feather of a bird, to push on the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
Of the veins from which one bleeds are thirty-one, of which there are sixteen in the head, that is to say: Two arteries that are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries that are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two ligaments that are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
One is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the common people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste", and is composed of the cephalic and basilic, and the common people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "vein of the belly", and is above the bend, and is the one from which one bleeds, which is clearly visible above the wrist.
And the salvatelle is the vein that is between the auricular and the annular, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is beneath the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second is the saphenous that is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein called "ness", which is at the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg there are three veins beneath those.
The bloodletting from veins near the ears helps with old colds and migraines;
and the qualities of the bloodletting, as I told you, are that you raise the patient's head and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient tightens their neck with a bandage, so that the two veins appear behind the ears in two places depending from the head: Then, with your finger, press where you feel the pulse beneath your finger, and draw blood from there;
Then take the lancet and insert it under the vein to the bone, then raise your hand over the entire vein, cut the skin and vein completely in two, and let the blood flow as much as you want;
then stop and bind it until it is healed;
and I have already said about incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries in the temples is good for chronic migraines, and chronic eye inflammation, and for acute eye pain.
and the quality of the bleeding is as I said: and it is that the patient should tighten their neck, so that the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from the inside.
Then lift the heart (or the part of the body) above the vein to your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward, and cut it, as you did in the other two veins, and allow the blood to flow according to your need;
Then release the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then put on cotton; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cuts and extractions, in the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein in the forehead is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for ailments of the face, headaches, and redness.
and the method is that the patient constricts their neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument called "a digger", of which this is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or something else, and allow blood to flow out according to the quantity you desire; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein so that it is healthy and sometimes the work is done with a wide flame.
However, the flame should not be too sharp; and it should be held sideways, for the bone is near, and perhaps the flame will break when it is thin.
The lancing of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts helps the eyes, and the forehead, and redness, and inflammation in the eye, and the ailments of the face;
and the qualities of their lancing are such that the patient strains their neck by twisting with some bandage, as before;
then lance, and let the lancing be across, a bit long of the flame, a bit wide, for there is no flesh. And if the flame is thin, perhaps it will break;
then make the blood flow as much as you need, and then bandage over with cotton, and bandage it well.
The lancing of the vein in the nose is good for fevers, and for sudden madness, and for facial illnesses, such as migraines and redness that comes to the face, especially when it is old;
And the technique for the lancing is that the patient should tighten their neck, then hold their nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long flame, and insert it between the lip in the space between the two nostrils, for the vein is not clearly visible there, and the blood will now begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and make the blood flow according to your need, then bandage it for a night, for it is very quickly restored;
The lancing of the two temples helps with tightening of the throat, and the beginning of a fever, and many illnesses, and to scabies, and to corrosives, and to herpes, and to shingles;
And the technique for the lancing is that the patient should tighten their neck from under one side and the other, as we have said;
And let the master be standing above the patient's head, and the patient sit upon a chair, then lance the vein along a bit widely, then draw the blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
Then do the same on the other vein, then loosen the bandage, and tighten both veins moderately, so that the patient does not choke; And leave it until morning, that the wound is healed.
Of the lancing of the lips The lancing of the veins of the lips above helps with phlegm in the mouth, and the corruption of the gums, and the fissures of the lips, and the nose and throat.
And the qualities of the lancing are to make the patient sit in front of you, and tighten their neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look for two veins, one on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognized by the fact that they are black, and because around them are small black veins:
Then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and likewise do with the two veins above and below, for it is the same method.
Of the lancing beneath the tongue Lancing the veins beneath the tongue helps after lancing the cephalic vein, and it is for constriction of the throat, and for illnesses of the eye, and illnesses of the mouth;
And the quality of the lancing is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and lifts the tongue, and looks beneath on each side for a black vein:
Then lance one and the other, and do not go too deeply, for the arteries are below.
The veins of the ribs, which are commonly lanced, are lanced according to two methods:
or by pricking with a wide, flat blade, or with a fine, olive-shaped blade like cutting knives, and it is called "anesil"; and are wide or fine according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the flat blade is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is useful for opening veins filled with thick, visible blood, and that contain thick, troubled blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped blade:
and is more subtle and pointed, and is for lancing thin veins, where there is subtle yellow blood.
The lancing of the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps illnesses that are under the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the surgeon that he lance wisely, and that he be wary of the artery below. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, it must be stopped, as I have said; And the blade should not be piercing, but cutting, like a knife.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then you must grasp it and try another; or you want a vein nearby, or you lance a vein in the middle of the arm instead: it is clearly visible; and cut it with the blade, a knife, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place to lance, you should first grasp the arm, and touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with a sign, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the blade of a knife; and be careful not to hit the artery when you see the place pierced, for that is the artery: Then wipe it.
And if you see blood flowing upwards like a child's urine, and the blood is red and subtle, know that it is blood from the artery: Hurry then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; Bind the arm, and leave it thus, and do not move it the patient;
and let him be careful, and do not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overwhelms you, and the medicine is not present, then cut the artery if it is exposed, for the head will recede; and stop the blood.
And take a nut husk, and split it, and take one half and bind it well until the next day;
if the blood stops, that is good; if not, then treat it as we have said, with the powders that stop blood;
and the stopping of the blood is not always easy due to the small area of the wound, and the strength of the limb's binding.
The vein's bleeding helps by drawing blood from the head above, and the body below, because it is composed of the basilica and cephalic, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the physician to be careful about the nerve that is below, and if he pierces too deeply, and finds the nerve, it will swell and the patient will be in serious trouble, and perhaps not heal.
and this nerve often appears, and if it does not appear in some people due to its subtlety, then you should cut it with the lancet. and cauterize the nerve as best you can.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, cut it lengthwise.
The physician who uses the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head and helps the eyes.
And it is necessary to bleed by pricking the olive vein or the myrtle vein, because it is the safest of all the veins, since it has neither nerve nor artery underneath it. However, it is necessary to find the easiest place, and nothing is amiss if one fails the first time, and one tries again. And perhaps the place swells in some men when one fails the first time, but that is no matter.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your judgment.
The first thing you should know about bleeding is that it is not administered except to preserve health and to avoid future illnesses.
And let the bleeding be performed in one of the three veins that are in the elbow. That is to say, cephalic, basilic, and median. And one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear.
And one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding administered to diseases has no fixed hour, but whenever necessary, by day or by night, at all hours and times.
And children should not be bled until fourteen years old, nor pregnant women except from the fourth to the seventh month. And the elderly who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
And when anyone wants to be bled, in whatever way, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines with a light clyster if they have retained much waste, so that the veins do not draw impurities from the intestines harmful to the main limbs.
And do not bleed those who are overly full of food, nor those who are drunk, as long as they are affected, nor those who are hydrops.
And one should beware of bleeding after a colic attack, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and a proliferation of habits in women, and childbirth, from fatigue, sleeplessness and fasting, and that all the virtue, either from the arm or the body;
then lessen the humors, if the blood is thick, through foods and drinks and medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter a bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein of the breast around the third, as we have said;
and guard yourself that day from work, and hardship, and lust, and similar things;
and be cheerful and joyous, and let the blood-letter be higher than the one being bled, and rub the arm two or three times, then tie the bandage moderately, because when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the area with your hands until the veins swell and are felt;
Then the blood-letter moistens the blade with a little old oil, and puts the finger of his left hand on the vein beneath the spot where he wants to bleed, so the vein does not burst and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like cords when bled, and some that are full of wind, so that when the blade is applied, they recoil and the vein cannot be opened, and such is the case; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the blood-letter must be careful in these matters.
And if the vein opens the first time, that's good; If not, he recommences a little below or above that spot, if the spot isn't swollen.
And if the spot is swollen, and the patient is frightened, he should leave it for one or two days, and do not tie the arm: perhaps a hot abscess will come there;
do not enter a bath, then recommence the bleeding if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you fear it will not release as much blood as you desire, then apply fire directly to that opening;
and work it a little hastily, before the spot becomes swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the area swollen, then do not recommence the bleeding, and put a little bit of oil-based ointment, for it alleviates the body of blood, and the ointment is softer in this spot than oil;
and thus administer the oil-based ointment in every bleeding you make on the veins, to stop the flow of blood;
and this same thing makes a blister and swelling on it, when one puts it on the spot; so the blood is subtle and spreads when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess comes, which happens many times, especially when it has not been bled enough at the time when the vein opening is small, then hurry and put a sponge soaked in hot water and salt on the spot, and hold it for an hour;
and you must do this after the blood has come out of the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm at all; and if you wish, put some aloes or myrrh mixed with juice of calamint, mastic, or similar.
And many times abscesses and appearances occur with the bleeding of the basilica.
So put your hand on it, and if you find the spot soft to the pressure of your hand, that appearance is bad. Then be careful not to put anything of what we have said on it, because perhaps it is open without blood from the artery;
but make a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with another remedy until it is healed.
And draw out each drop of blood according to the quantity of its virtue, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin; and if it is too hot, let it cool down.
And it is fitting for someone who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, that they be given a larger wound, and the incisions be wide.
and for someone who is weak, do the opposite, and it is necessary to bleed them little and often, and one should bleed them by slicing across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bleeding is safe from the outflow of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding from the long or the wide.
And to someone whose body weakens from bleeding, it is necessary to give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; If he is feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold disposition, have him eat bread soaked in a syrup made from honey or aromatic honey syrup with spices, like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and well-scented syrup, before the bleeding.
And if he faints during bleeding, after the outflow of much blood, it is necessary that he drink broth of meat, and subtle scented syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the division or chapter on fainting, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wishes to bleed his arm again, and bleed another time, it is necessary, when he is weakened by extensive bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the amount of his ongoing strength.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second or third day.
For he has much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; so a large quantity must be drawn, and the opening enlarged until it bleeds profusely; since you observe all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on his pulse when he bleeds, so that death does not come in place of profuse bleeding, and this happens many times, when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not appropriate when you want to untie the arm, and make blood flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly on it; or if it is bent, that he extend the arm quickly, for that would be bad;
but let it bleed a second time; or you prick it with the tip of the flame, so that the blood which is congealed in the opening of the vein flows freely, and place a little warmed oil, and press lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, then bleed it in that same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the vein of the head because it is composed.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the skin is red;
then it is tied moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it straight through, not wide nor long;
and let the puncture be wide, and let it bleed well near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for one puts it more in winter than in summer;
and the bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve in it.
Bleeding from the vein in the right hand is good for all liver illnesses, and this is the method:
Hold the hand, and put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if the bleeding is sideways, and if you cut it completely through, nothing serious will happen;
and do not go too deep, because the nerves are beneath, all bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is frozen in the wound, and cannot get out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and salt on the vein to quickly close it, and do the same for each vein.
Bleeding from the left hand is good for mouse disease, and do the same as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the temple is good for all illnesses that are below the body, like illnesses of the marrow, and retention of flowers, and illnesses of the kidneys, and of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts their foot in hot water, and rubs over the vein until it bursts, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot there are many kidneys;
So bleed then in the largest kidney or at the ankle, whichever is better.
And if you bleed above the foot, beware of the nerves that are beneath, and bleed across as if cutting;
And let the flame be soft.
And if the blood cannot come out, then return the foot to the water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the lancing fails the first time, then begin again a little higher, for the spot is spoiled;
And do not be afraid of the nerve, as we have said, and likewise do so with the sole of the other foot.
The site of the sciatic vein is at the heel, and its lancing relieves pain in the hip, when it is for hot blood.
And the quality of its lancing is that the patient enters a bath, and grasps above the ankle with four fingers by twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
And if it appears, then lance it in all the ways that you can, and by crossing; And it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very susceptible to hands.
And it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very susceptible to hands. And if you do not find it, then lance any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and guard against the nerves;
and make as much blood flow as you wish, and then loosen the ligature, and put on cotton and tighten it; It is now healed.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass;
And cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping without striking is in two ways: either with fire, or without fire;
and cupping done by striking and drawing blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is all on the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others in the two sides of the neck; and the cupping under the chin; and the cupping on the two shoulders; and the cupping above the hips; and cupping between the two arms; and cupping on the two legs; and cupping on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw much blood, except for small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason it does not weaken one, like bloodletting from a vein; and it should not be administered, neither with nor without fire, in any disease caused by fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
And if cupping is necessary for illnesses, or for habit, we administer it each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at all times;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are those who find fullness and redness on their face, and in their head, and neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we order cupping after three hours of the day.
The leech from the temple helps the heaviness of the head ... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of the leech from the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary for those of cold complexion to use it, or those with a cold, for it does them much harm;
and therefore, the elderly should not use it, nor those who have cold ailments in their heads.
And those who often bleed themselves become forgetful, and therefore the cupping must be placed a little lower, because of the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bleeding from the head and from the basilica vein, and therefore it is good for tightening the breast, and for a tear in the windpipe, and for all of these, and for fullness.
And it should not be applied too forcefully, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness in the stomach and the heart.
Cupping on the second rib of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraines, and for strangulation, and for pain in the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bleeding from the basilica vein.
And you should instruct the patient to press his hand while applying it, so that he does not cut the artery, and there is no bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth diseases, and for gum decay, and similar diseases in the mouth. And it is in place of bleeding from the two lips.
Cupping on the shoulders is good for diseases caused by heat and fullness.
Cupping on the elbows is as good as cupping on the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from those large veins.
And instruct the master that he should not strike too hard or too deeply, for the area is bare of flesh, and is near nerves and arteries.
A cupping cup placed on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament and for diseases below, and the cupping cup should be large, and made of bronze, as it needs to draw well. And perhaps, if it were thin, it would break. and it would cause great wounds.
Cupping on the legs bleeds openly, as it draws blood from the entire body, and is effective for old pains in the kidneys, bladder, and groin, and it restores vitality.
And they are placed at the two ankles and two wrists, and nonetheless they weaken the body after prolonged use, and cause paleness in many conditions.
The way to apply a cupping device is to first make it empty, and gently suck it on, apply it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease from doing this until you see the area reddened and swollen, and the blood's redness appears.
Then, lift and replace the cupping devices, and be watchful of the body's condition, for there are those who have soft flesh and clear skin. So it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make large wounds, and somewhat deep. And suck gently.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice. The first time to thin the thick blood's path.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time.
And when we wish to draw blood little by little, only one strike suffices. And if we want much blood, we repeat often.
And if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the result is that the heart is pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those with thick and hard skin, and narrow pores, that you oil the suction cup locations with an aperitive and dissolving oil. if it is in this state, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or gourd seed oil;
and if it is in winter, of cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or other similar one.
And if the superfluities are thick and cold, take amarantin oil, or balsamite oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
And if the one who is being treated has tender skin and large pores, one should not put any oil, but it should be washed after the suction with rose water, or cold water, or morel water, or gourd water, or porcelain water, or other similar one.
And he who has much moisture, let him rise with oil of basil, or water of myrtle, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities rise with old wine, or water of the quince, or decoction of anise or chamomile, or other similar ones;
and one should not be bled by cupping before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath one or two hours;
and do not sleep after the cupping, and it is necessary that he wash himself when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And beware if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; if it is necessary that he take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces, and similar things; and eat young birds, and rabbit meat, and moist meats.
and eat young birds, and rabbit meat, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion should take syrup of honey, and medium-aged fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat young birds and small birds and pigeons;
and the day that he will be purged, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes a triacle or nutmeg before the purging, or afterwards, to strengthen the main limbs; and the blood should be diluted, but those who are hot should not drink it.
Cupping that is applied without striking is that which is applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the stomach and the belly and the kidneys and the hip, because those members do not tolerate striking upon them, and it is done only to draw blood from limb to limb, as we apply to the breasts when the nipple bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, as we apply cupping to the stomach and the belly to thin the limb;
and it relieves the pain, when there is obstruction or a stone, so it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or loosens the stone from its place;
and thus it acts when applied to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cupping glasses are administered empty for sucking only; and sometimes are administered with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a manner that one fills the cupping glass with warm water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping glass administered with fire is thus:
And it should be two fingers wide and a half palm deep, and have, on the side near the middle, one small hole, as for pushing in a needle, and be of brass, soft on the front so that it does not hurt the patient when placed on the limb;
and have in the middle a cross-bar of brass or iron, to place a lit candle on, and they should be large and small according to the illnesses and the age of those who use them;
for the cupping glasses for children are different from those for the old, and for the thin from those for the fat.
And one should thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
light the candle of wax or linen, and place it in the middle of the cupping glass on the bar that is in the cupping glass, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cupping glass and does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the opening that we have mentioned, so that when desired, the vapor escapes, and the cupping glass is removed;
and one lights the linen as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass, then, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, acute, there is no bar or opening, and it is not administered except when it is full of water, and it is placed only on the limb;
and this is the form:
Leeches are not administered except on limbs where one cannot apply cupping vessels due to their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places lacking flesh, such as the ear or nose, and other similar ones;
and the quality of their use is that when you find leeches that are in clear, soft water without puncture marks, take them;
and put them in soft water until they are accustomed and have nothing in their stomachs; and then bleed the vein and apply a cupping vessel, then rub the limb until it is red, and place the leeches;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where a cupping vessel can be placed, put one, for this is very beneficial.
If not, then wash the area gently, then with water, very well, and then dry it;
and if the area bleeds too much after the leeches, soak a linen cloth in cold water, and apply it until the bleeding is stopped;
and if the bleeding is excessive, apply ground vitriol or gall, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or you place half peeled beans over the area and leave them until they become warm to the area, this will now stop the bleeding;
and if you need more, then take more leeches.
And if the leeches will not attach, rub the area with fresh blood, or stick a needle in it until blood flows, then apply the leeches, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little ground aloes and salt, or ashes, on top, and they will fall off now.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish men scoff at this chapter, having never seen any of the ancient books, nor read a letter in them;
and for this reason, knowledge is rare in our land, for I have never found any good;
and I know nothing, except through the knowledge of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have mastered the science, and through experience, and through the practice of my life;
and I have described in this chapter what is contained, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of instruments used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
Therefore, we must state in the prologue of this book the sum of the words and the chapters where the wise man focuses his understanding, and remains on the truth, so that those who are tested may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture, dislocation, twisting, or crushing occurs to someone, you must quickly bleed the patient on both sides, unless something prevents you, such as weakness of the body, or infancy, or old age; or if the weather is not very warm, or too cold;
and avoid cold foods, that is to say cold dishes, and the flesh of birds and roe deer, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not overfill him with foods that fill the veins with blood, so that you do not fear a hot abscess, or the spreading of matter to the limb;
so that the patient returns to his prior, usual condition.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be nourished with foods that promote growth and viscosity, such as cooked wheat in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow's belly, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the break heals more quickly and readily.
And know that broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal or knit properly according to their nature due to the dryness of the limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
but there is no cure, except to place large splints that support and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not remove it entirely from its work, and for this reason, it should be nourished with rich foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the arm or leg, and I will tell you all types of fractures in this chapter. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another that is jagged, like the cutting of a feather for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another that is jagged, like the cutting of a feather for writing. And there are fractures with wounds, and fractures with only a small crack.
And for each type there is its own remedy, and its own specific instrument for restoration, according to what the memory brings to its place;
And a fracture of the bone is recognized because the place is twisted, and it shows clearly by feeling, and it sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting nor sound when touched, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture.
but there may still be twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. If so, you should not move it by hand, but apply the medicines that come after, and then gently restrain it.
And know that a fracture that extends outward, and the two parts are separated, they must now be put into equal alignment, lest a hot abscess arise.
and if a hot abscess comes, leave it for a day or two, until the abscess is subsided;
then align it as well as you can gently and wisely, and know that the restoration is easier than for one with broken pieces;
then restrain it, as it should be done afterward.
And if the bone is broken into pieces, and it is split in two parts, whether it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you bring the additions back to their place to the best of your ability, and be careful that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and well join the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if you think it is not properly set:
if you straighten it beautifully, and do not constrain it too much, nor press it as those who, by their work, cause a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is in place, carefully instruct the patient not to move it, neither when awake nor when asleep, nor turning, nor in any other way; and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be placed in such a position that it feels no pain;
and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not properly set, and it must be placed in such a position that it feels no pain; and be careful that it is placed straight, that no crookedness comes when it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in size and in shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar ones: so it is necessary to wrap cloths of soft and subtle linen; and those that are large, such as thighs and legs:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and hard bandage, for the wide bandage encompasses the entire large limb, and constricts it equally from all sides, so that there is no unevenness;
then tie around light padding, three or four turns according to the limb, and hold your hand a little on the whole bandage, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so the fracture moves away a little from the fracture;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large portion of the healthy place, then take another bandage, and turn around again over the fractured place;
then return to the part below the fracture, and tighten moderately, neither too tight nor too loose, as we have said in the first bandage above;
then put between the bandages linen or cloth padding, until it is all even, then tie everything over the bandage, and then put your splints well made over it, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, put something that calms the abscess on top, and that removes the swelling, and leave it like that for several days;
then bind tightly over your splints, and let them be half the width of a carefully sawn cane, or of the wood from which cleaves are made, or of palm fronds, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint placed over the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and be as long as is necessary for the limb's size or smallness; then bind tightly over the splints as you did in the first binding, then tie a bandage over it, as in the first binding over the break; tighter on top, gradually less so;
and the bandages should be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the bandages are thick, like the works of fools who make their bandages from twisted linen cords, and that is a great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not appropriate that there be less than a finger's width of space between each splint.
And if the patient is wounded by the edges of the splints after the tightening in healthy places, then put linen or wool wadding under them so that he is not injured.
When the wound is with the fracture, and the bone is broken, I will discuss the treatment later.
And know that it is not appropriate to tighten splints on all broken limbs on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not appropriate to put splints on it strongly until after five days or seven, or more, depending on your certainty of a hot abscess occurring.
And see here the manner of ancient poultices for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists:
and it is that you take flour that is found on the mill walls, and mix it with abundant eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common way of the poultice restoring fractures in many conditions, and especially for women and young children, because it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another way of poultice restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists: take 3 parts of abareis and ladani and enule and asafetida and gum arabic and mugat, each a total of 10 parts. myrrh and aloes, each 5 parts; alechil 9 parts; and make it into powder, and mix it with the white of an egg; if the man's complexion is hot, then use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is good for many men.
Another kind of plaster that is good for sprains: take mugwort and wild mallow, each 10 parts; myrrh and aloes, each 9 parts; galbanum 6 parts; Armenian bole 10 parts, and grind well, and mix with water or plenty of egg, and administer.
Another method of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their place, and alleviates the pain arising from, and the wear of, the bone and the fracture: Take new wool, and soak it in warm oil and cooked oil, and apply it to the affected area.
These plasters do not heal, but they are good for easing a hot abscess, and properly relieving the pains.
Another method of plaster that heals broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of ground ivy, and crush them together, and make a plaster.
Another method of plaster for the restoration of a broken bone and for reducing the remaining abscess. Take root of mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and chickpea flour, of each one part;
and crush them, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or water, and use it.
Another method of a stronger plaster than the first, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of the limb. Take roots of mallow, and flaxseed, baluster, melilot, and sanicle, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all one part; and crush them, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a fractured limb to restore strength anything other than a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a fractured limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and chopped men's hairs, or bird feathers, and vismalve, and sil also, and crush them, and make a plaster from it and apply it.
And then remove it a little later, and be careful if the patient feels no pain, and the bone has not moved from its place; if not, do not remove it for several days. And if pain comes to the place, or itching, lack of rest or swelling, then hurry, and remove it, and take off the plaster now;
and take a light cloth, and a wet sea sponge, and dip it in water, and apply it to the place, until the itching stops, and the pain is calmed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, soaked in water or rose oil, and bind it for a night, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain is gone, then restart the gentle bandage, and a little plaster, and do not bind it quite so tightly as before; and gently until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling are completely gone, and you need a plaster and bandage, then restart it, just as you did the first time.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, do not loosen it until after 3 or 4 or 5 or 7 days; and sometimes leave it for 20 days, according to what is seen, until the break heals, and the flesh approaches the joint.
then restrain it more than before, and make its flesh grow thicker, as I said before;
and if you see the place drying more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there; apply then warm water frequently, every third day, and slightly loosen the bandage;
by this method then nourishment comes to the limb, and quickly corrects what foolish doctors do, who restore the limb incorrectly:
This is bad, and such work is dangerous, and I see no other way than to leave it and work correctly.
Many kinds of fractures exist, and diverse forms, and the causes are distinct;
For there are fractures made by the impact of a sword, and the collarbone breaks all the bone right down to the surface beneath the bone, just as a stake or a log does; And for that reason this type of fracture is called "haichure.
Where the sword cuts the bone from above, piercing it, and this type of fracture is called "absolu";
And the wound from these two fractures is great or small.
And if there is a penetrating impact, or a fracture of the collarbone, or a fall on a stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a piercing fracture, which approaches the tissue beneath the bone, or it is upon the bone, and this wound is either great or small.
And if there is a wound that is embedded in the bone as subtle as a hair, and the fracture is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound is made either by hitting a stone, or by falling, or by something similar, and forces a piece of the bone inward, and the place is bruised as blacksmiths do when they hit cauldrons; if between the stones inside.
And this happens more to those who have soft bones in the head, like a child's head;
and happens to all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated from them like splinters; and I will speak in its place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the pulling on them, and the examination of the skin, and by the corrupted flesh on them.
The appearance of the hairline is known by this: when one has exposed the bone, and rubs the surface, the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting, loss of consciousness, stretching, swooning, high fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar symptoms in several conditions, it cannot heal without a doubt.
And if you do not see frightening symptoms, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
And when the injured person comes to you first, and it is in winter, you must remove the bone before the fourteenth day if you can.
And if it is in summer, hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest the tissue beneath the bone be corrupted, and the symptoms that we have mentioned come.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane covering the brain, you must split the fractured part thus:
and you take the head of the injured person, and uncover the bone in every way you can, and gently over the wound's surface, and if blood or pus comes when you uncover the bone, help them with what is necessary, and you fill the space with cloths soaked in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the pus is calmed, and be sure of the discharge of blood; then begin to remove the bone, and this is done according to two types of work:
One way is to cut a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then add another incision larger than the first.
And the second way is that you have a number of various incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they should be pointed, and made of hard iron;
and work gently, so you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, you must pierce it around it, before administering incisions with drills, not deep enough to pierce the bone of the skull, and there should be a margin or circle above the point, which does not allow the point to pass beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each one goes to its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all the skulls;
and this is the form of the three types of drills:
The quality for piercing around the broken bone is that you place a drill on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is pierced;
then reposition the drill slightly afterwards, and do this all around, then cut with chisels the space of the bone that is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you draw the bone into your hand, or with any of the instruments that you have, such as pliers, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain nor the surface.
And when you have pierced and drawn the bone, you must then remove the remaining part of the bone with any other instrument similar to a chisel, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other chisel;
and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments. then treat the wound with poultices and ointments that we have mentioned.
And another method of work is that which Galen describes, which is safer; and the latter is very strong, and that is his word. It is necessary first that you expose a part of the bone, where the fracture appears, so that when you have exposed that part, you place under the head of this incisive lens, of which this is the shape:
And do not cut from one side, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike lightly with a small mallet on top, so that you cut the bone lightly all around, and be careful of the cloth that is underneath;
if it is stuck to the bone, then gently remove it, for it is removed well without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not pierce through the cloth, and the bone is only cut superficially, and there are small pieces, then it is necessary to remove that roughness, and remove the scales with a fine scraper, of which you should have various sizes, to apply the most suitable one to each place, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
Use larger scrapers first, and then finer ones afterwards, and do not cease until it is well.
In each of the other incisions and subtle fractures, you must apply a cause according to its alignment;
and this is something that is not easily answered by one who has devoted their study to this art.
And if the surface is uncovered, you should take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound; then take another cloth doubled in two or three, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so you do not burden the surface, then apply another bandage on top, and do not bind it too tightly, only enough to hold the wound together;
and leave it like this for one or two days, until the inflamed abscess is calmed, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and make a powder from these things, and apply it to the wound, and apply further medicines without causing any irritation;
and watch that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave any ointment, nor allow any pus to collect, for when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it will spread and fester, and great harm will befall the patient;
for when you put something irritating on the surface, it will cause inflammation. Beware then, if any bad accident comes to the patient, as we have said, it is doubtful without a doubt.
And if the discoloration does not arise except from the medicine applied, that such a virtue may have it, you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil and mix it with a bandage, and apply it to the surface; then treat it with the necessary methods of treatment until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two upper parts of the nose are broken, or one by itself, for there are two bones.
and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, but only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must place your index finger in the nostril, and align that break with your index finger, and with your thumb on the other side, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and watch that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, you must align it with the head of a small, slightly thick stick.
And if the break is in two parts, do likewise again, and hurry to restore it on the first day, if possible;
If not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess has calmed down, then place strips of linen on the top of the nose, if the break is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the break is there; and let the strips be so thick that they fill the holes of the nose.
And some restorers say that one should soak the strips in butter, and change them each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they should be soaked in a mixture of egg white and mill powder; then leave the strip in place until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are placed in the nose in place of strips, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient breathes through it; or do whatever you want.
And if a boil comes to the nose while you work on it, put a plaster or moistened cotton in rose oil, or a little bit of diachylon.
And if a boil does not come, apply a plaster on the outside, of chickpea flour and incense powder, mixed with the white of an egg, then put light cloths over it, and do not tie the nose.
And if the nasal fracture is small, and it is broken into small pieces, remove it with suitable instruments, then stitch the fracture, and treat it with things that strengthen the flesh and join, like suitable plasters and ointments.
And if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead canes in it until it is healed.
When the jaw is fractured underneath, and there is no wound on the outside, and the fracture is only on the outside, and not broken in two, except for splinters inside, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you place your index finger into the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, place your right index finger, and gently push the fracture inward, and hold it in place with the other hand, and equalize it.
And if the jaw fracture is separated in two, it is necessary that you apply extension to both parts, until they are equal.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, hold them with a gold, silver, or silk thread, then place a plaster on the fractured jaw, and put a double bandage over it; and place a large, well-made splint, or a piece of equal-sized leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it over the muscles as best you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, untie it on the third day, and then restore what has changed. and apply a plaster, of mill powder with plenty of egg or sesame flour, after you have removed the plaster;
and place light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster is dry, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until he is healed; Many times he is healed in three weeks.
And if a hot abscess comes, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, see if any piece of the bone has been removed; If subtle, remove it with suitable instruments for that.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with fire according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remains, close the wound, if it is large, and apply suitable plasters to it, to grow flesh, until it is healed.
The forceps often break, towards the shoulder, and the fracture is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
where there is a fracture with a wound.
And the work is such that when the fracture is without a wound, you should have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder where the forceps are broken; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then place the fracture equally with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor ending.
And if you need to extend further, place a round sphere of cloth or wool under the patient's shoulder, and let it be as thick as necessary; and extend and lift the forceps, and hold the sphere in your hand, so that you place the fracture equally, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the forceps out, because it goes deep inside, then the patient must lie often on their back, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and the attendant pushes the shoulder down, until the bone of the forceps is lifted.
And then adjust the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken, you must split it open.
and pull the pieces gently, and if the bone cannot join by any means, then cut it with one of the incisors you have. but place this instrument under the forceps, to protect the surface.
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the strength of the work;
and have two heads, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, just as is the opening of the wound you made when you pulled the bones;
and when you are certain of a hot abscess, then cauterize the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with strips and tents, according to its quantity.
And if hot abscesses come, then soak the strips in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and place on top.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you place on the bone the plaster of flour of the mill and of egg white, and put light cloths on top, and place a sphere under the saddle, if you need it; Then take a very large bandage, one palm wide, then put a double strip on top of the cloths, and the plaster; Then take a thin stick three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage hangs down; and place the stick on the fracture, and turn the bandage around the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the diseased armpit; and bind it from each part, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture correctly, and you clearly see that the stick does not move from the broken bone, then watch it every day, and when the bandage loosens, then tighten it;
and have the patient lie on their back, and put a small pillow under the armpit when they sleep, to raise the shoulder; so that the fracture will be relieved from the pressure by raising the shoulder, or you bind the arm to the neck, and do not unbind it if bad accidents do not occur, until twenty days;
then renew the plaster if you see that it is needed, and tighten and leave it thus, until it is restored;
and it is restored in at most twenty-eight days, and in less time in some men.
of the fracture of the shoulder
Sometimes the shoulder breaks in a wide area or in the middle, and one does not know it is broken except by touching it;
if you align it according to the pattern of the break, and reset it according to its natural shape, in every way you can;
then put on the area flour from the mill with plenty of egg, and light bandages, and place a double cloth over it; then place a large and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if there are gaps under the splint anywhere on the shoulder, fill those gaps with linen bandages, so that the splint is evenly supported;
and then bind it tightly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day;
and every time it softens, bind it again, and adjust the splint if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on their side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this number is complete, unbind it, and be sure, for it is not bone that easily gets out of place.
And if a piece of bone is protruding, and it is below the skin, cut it open, and remove it, and do as we have said in the treatment of a severe fracture to alleviate a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breast.
The breastbone is sometimes fractured in the middle, but this rarely happens; but it often breaks from the outside.
And when it is fractured in the middle, it tilts downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and a lack of breath, and nausea, and possibly vomits blood, and the fractured bone's splinters are visible, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on their back, and a cushion is placed between the shoulders, then the shoulders are pressed, and the ribs of the two sides are brought together with your hands, and meticulously aligned in all ways you can, until the bone's form is as it should be;
then place plasters and dressings over the subtle, thin layer of salt, or some other light material, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the fractured bone so that it does not move; and wrap the bandage around the back, and tighten it appropriately, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs loosening, due to corrosion or itching that occurs in the area, or pain or abscess, then hurry and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and address whatever has come about with the appropriate treatments;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the ribs
Know that a rib fracture only occurs in thick areas after the back, and in the chest, and they only break because they are brittle; and one senses it well by examining the sides.
And the restoration is that you align the fracture, as is necessary. And then apply a plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need one.
And if the rib fracture is inward, the patient feels extreme pain, and a stabbing pain, just as from pleurisy, because the bone pierces the tissue; and breathes in sharp gasps, and coughs and vomits up a large quantity of blood, and this is a serious ailment, and the ancients have devoted much ingenuity to it.
And some say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest a hot abscess develop, if one has not already appeared. And if one has developed, then treat it.
And some of you say that cupping should be applied to the area, to draw out strongly, and this seems reasonable. However, there is doubt that the cupping will draw out the superfluities to the area due to a weakness in the disposition.
And some of you say that the area should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil, and that tents are placed between the ribs to evenly compress the surrounding area, then treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that they cannot endure because of the bone piercing the tissue, and there is doubt in the patient, then it is necessary to cut above the broken rib area, and it is necessary to put an instrument underneath to protect the surface.
and then the bone should be cut, and pulled gently, and then sew the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes, place damp cloths in rose oil on the area.
and treat the area as is appropriate for an abscess, and have them lie frequently on their side where it should be, until healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you wish to know if they will be healed or not, be aware if you see their hands softened and swollen and dead, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it.
Know that it is mortal in many cases, and if they move them and feel them well when they are squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is unharmed, and that the patient will be cured, if treatment is applied.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you wish to know if they will be healed or not, be aware if the feet are softened, and if the accidents are there that are in the hands, and on the back there is windiness and expulsion without will;
and when it is raised on its belly, there is expulsion without will. And when it is raised on its back and it wants to sit, it cannot. Know that it is mortal: so do not labor much in its cure.
And if these accidents do not come to him, the thing is less severe.
And the cure is that if there is a hot abscess, you put on rose oil or egg oil on it until it is calmed;
then put on one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on that part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone separates, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a stitch, then cure it with an ointment that generates flesh, until it is healed;
and if the bone head is broken, which is called the "head of the knuckle", then put your left hand's finger into it, and put it level with your other hand to the best of your ability, then put the plaster and the splint on top, if you need them;
then hold it tight, and if there is a separated bone, cut it open, and remove it, and cure the wound until it is healed.
of the fracture of the hip bone
Sometimes the hip bone is fractured, and if it happens, there is rarely a small amount of fragmentation in the head; and it breaks lengthwise, and deviates to the inside, and causes the patient pain at the site, and a puncture, and the fractured area swells.
And the restoration is that you place your hand on the fracture; and know the location and shape of the fracture;
and if the fracture is only in the head, then put the broken piece back into its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it tilts inward, lay the patient on their stomach until the restoration of the fracture is apparent. And when you have aligned it, apply a plaster, then place a wooden or leather splint, and bind the fracture so it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, so the injury is equal. And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess arises, do not touch it until the hot abscess is calmed, and apply what we have previously said; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as necessary, if there is no bad accident;
of the shoulder fracture
The shoulder is that which is between the rib and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, it should be restored according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie to the two heads two straps, and hang them upward, and have the patient sit on a seat;
then place the broken arm on the wood, so that it reaches the armpit, and put a curve of wood in the middle, then hang it on some heavy object or have the attendant stretch it downward;
then the attendant should place the fracture equal to his hands together, so that the fracture returns as it should.
And another method is that the patient is supported on a stretcher, and the hand is tied to his neck, then instruct two attendants, one to hold what is on the fracture with their hands, and the other to hold underneath with a whole strap, and each to stretch to their part.
And if you want the extraction to be stronger, then tighten a strap under the fracture, and one above the fracture, and each of the attendants stretches to their side.
And if the fracture is near the shoulder head, then you should place one strap under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, under the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, then a light strap should be placed there, without difficulty, so that the fracture is equal above the place and above the elbow;
then put the fracture straight as it should be, and hold it tight, if no abscess is present.
And if a hot abscess comes, then do not hold it tight for seven days, and put wet wool on it with rose oil, until the hot abscess is calmed;
then hold it tight, and the way to hold it tight is that you put the plaster on the fracture, then bring the arm up to the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and put the bandage, and tighten it around the shoulder and around the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone has not shifted.
And if you doubt that the bone will move, then use splints, and place a splint larger and stronger than the others on the fracture, and have one inch of space between each splint, and each splint should be so large that it extends three inches beyond the fracture on each side;
then tighten around the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter concerning the fracture, tighter and less as it stretches away.
And if you see the positioning of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, at the time you restore the fractured limb, and you suspect a hot abscess, leave it to be bound until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check the bandage every three days, to see that itching, swelling, or inflammation do not appear in the area, or that the nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If it is correctly aligned, as we have said.
And if no such accidents occur, do not loosen it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on their back, and have their hands on their stomach;
and place a cushion full of wool beneath the shoulder, and check every hour of the day or night that the shape of the fractured limb does not move, or that the bandages are not softened;
if it is correctly aligned by the power of medicine, and give it the food we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is first finely ground; and when it begins to recover, it should be substantial.
And it is customary for the shoulder and the leg to be recovered within forty days in total; and then one should loosen it and administer baths and medicinal ointments to correct the area.
And if the constriction is severe and tight, it remains to be loosened for 10 days or 2 months.
of the broken arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "forearm bones", of which one is smaller, and is the one that touches the wrist;
and the other is large, and is the one that is underneath, next to the small finger;
perhaps the large forearm bone is broken alone, or the small one, and perhaps both together.
When the smaller forearm bone is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and more serious than when both are broken together.
If it is the smaller forearm bone that is broken alone, then it must be gently straightened a little, and put in line.
And if it is the large forearm bone, then it must be straightened more forcefully;
and extend it on a cushion, and keep the thumb higher than the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient lie crossed over themselves, and the cushion in front of them higher, so that the patient does not suffer any labor;
Then let the assistants extend their arms to the part below their hand, or to a ligament, and another assistant to the other above.
And then let the surgeon place it in line, according to its best form.
And if it is broken into pieces, then put each in its place, and if there is any separated piece that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it open and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, we have spoken about it in a separate chapter. So take the treatment.
And if in the beginning of the restoration, there are hot abscesses, apply a bandage of plaster made of rose oil and white wax, neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the bandage gently, until the hot abscess is calmed.
And then remove the plaster, and apply a poultice of mill powder with plenty of egg, then put on splints, and let the splint for the fracture be stronger and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints or more in various positions on the arm: whether the fracture be in one bone, or in two;
and hold it more tightly over the fracture than elsewhere, and gradually less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And watch the limb and the bandage after several days. And if any bad accident comes to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must wash the limb with hot water until the itching is calmed;
and let the limb rest neither too tightly nor too loosely.
And then restart the tightening, and if the bandages are softened and the bones separated, or similar things, then adjust it.
And be careful that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it like that for several days, until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happen to the patient, do not loosen it until twenty days.
or, if necessary, he hangs his arms around his neck, and keeps his neck straight, and watch out for movements and touching, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is restored in 30 or 35 days, and perhaps in 20 days, according to the compositions and complexions of the virtues.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the ends of the fingers, there are few fractures, and there is often only bending.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, it is necessary that the patient sit crossed-legged, and sit straight and equally in front of him;
then place his hand on a flat surface, and let the attendant extend the broken bones, and place them equal, so that they are well joined;
and place the plaster and bandages, if no abscess forms, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and wrap it in a linen bandage.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the sole of the foot, make a sphere of cloth, and instruct the patient to press it against their broken foot; and then bind it with a long bandage, and let the splint be of soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it, as is appropriate.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place a splint on top, and another beneath in the sole, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it completely around the hand, and tighten the bandage between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs in any of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it straight as is appropriate; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to lift the fracture and keep it still;
and if the fracture is in other fingers, such as the index or one of the others, set it straight and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or you bind them all together in a row, however it is necessary, or you place a splint on them, as on the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and in the treatment of a hot abscess, and help those who come, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and it is clearly seen when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is done by tying one bandage over the break, and another under it. And the patient lies on their face, then each attendant stretches their bandage to their side equally;
and that's when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is near the root of the thigh, one bandage should be towards the groin, and the other bandage beneath the break.
And also if it is near the knee, then one bandage should be beside the knee, and the extension should be below;
then the surgeon should align the bone with both hands, until it is according to its natural shape, and then apply the plaster, and bandage it, if no abscess forms there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it calm down, then return to your work and your treatment; The treatment is done in this manner.
You must wrap the break with one hard bandage doubled in two or three, and excess should remain, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and place one long thread between the thigh and leg, below the knee, and the thread's end should be above;
then turn the bandage around the leg and thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and put a splint over the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to equalize the tightness, then begin to tightly bind three or four twists over the fracture; and the higher you go above the fracture, the less it is tightened;
then tie the two ends of the thread you placed between the leg and thigh, and bind three splints that are above, then return below to the thread's end, until you get next to the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like that, so that neither an abscess nor swelling nor any other similar thing comes to it. And if it happens, then untie it, and treat whatever comes to it, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of the bone that prick, it must be dealt with, if one can. and if one cannot, one must split the area and draw out the force; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken, so that splints are put in it, as in the shoulder and the arm;
However, in such restoration, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in seven days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversity of complexions.
Know that in the joint of the knee, there is little breaking, but it bends often.
And if it breaks, it is not just a fissure, or a hole, and it happens in all wounds, and without wounds, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is done by putting the broken parts together as much as possible;
then apply the plaster, and place a round splint, if needed, and bind it as is appropriate, then observe all the precautions that we have stated in other fractures, such as a hot abscess and other similar things; then apply whatever is necessary for each accident until it is healed.
of the broken leg
Know that there are two bones in the leg, of which one is called by the proper name "tibia", and the other is called "fibula";
and any fracture happens in the same way as in the arm, and therefore the restoration is similar to that of the arm also, and the treatment is exactly the same.  And if the two bones are fractured together, the leg turns in every direction.
And if the smaller bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and it is clearly visible; and it turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and put it straight, and bind the splints equally;
However, if the fracture is severe, and there are multiple pieces, the extension should be less forceful and gentler; and adjust it according to your skill.
And when you have completed all your work, take two strips of wood that support the leg on either side, and are the length of the leg from the knee downwards;
then wrap them in two places with one bandage above and below, and tie it in the middle as well; and with this binding, the leg will not bend to the right or left, and thus it is well;
and some place a splint the length of the leg, made of wood, and put the leg on it to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg every day to see if there is a hot abscess or other accident; if treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but at the bones of the foot there is sometimes a fracture and at the toes too, and there is only a crack in several positions.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping, place the patient's foot on the ground, as if they were going to walk, then place your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, and press them until they return to their place;
Then apply the plaster and bandages, and place a small board two spans wide under the sole of the foot, then secure it to the foot, after you have wrapped the bandages around it, and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones aligned, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, reset them, as we have said for the fingers of the hand; Then place a splint along the length of the broken toe, and slightly wider, then place the board I mentioned under the foot, and secure it properly;
And if there are two or three, or more, broken toes, place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a linen bandage, and secure the board under the foot; And let it rest on the top of the board, avoiding the sole of the foot, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things I have said about other fractures, which we have already discussed; and treat each accident as is appropriate.
of the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman's nature is fractured, have her sit up, then lean her to the back and hold her from behind;
then let the attendant fill the patient's nature with cotton, and put in as much as will fit;
then raise the woman up, and lift her back slowly, and then the cotton will jump until it reaches the entrance of the nature, and the bone returns with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and do this for seven days or so: then the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a bladder of a ram, and tie a string to the opening, and put the entire bladder into the nature; then blow into the string forcefully, until the bladder is inflated inside: the nature will return the fracture;
then fill it with cotton, and leave it like that for a few days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the man's or woman's finger is broken, restore it like we have said for the bone of the hip;
and these near-by fractures are not hidden from the one who studies and practices it, and understands my book.
For the fracture signifies, in many ways, the right path to restoration: Understand it then.
In the finger, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and put the finger in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it three days or until it heals, and it will be healthy quickly.
of fracture with wound
It is necessary for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder or similar, that they be bled now, so that the bleedings we have mentioned testify to this.
And if the wound bleeds, stop the bleeding with vitriol, if you have no other thing, then resume restoring the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if no hot abscess comes.
And if a hot abscess comes, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess is calmed, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause bad accidents.
And if the broken bone is apparent above the uncovered flesh, then you must put it in place gently with your hands, with a small extension.
And if the extension is not suitable for putting it straight with your hands, then realign it with this iron instrument, which is seven or eight inches long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, the surgeon needs three or four, according to what he needs in each fracture treatment;
and let it be round and a little thick, so that it does not bend at all when pressing on the limb during your work, and let it be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called a "palanche," so that the curved piece must be placed over the head of the visible bone; and push it once, so that it returns, and let them be even against each other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot properly grip the bone, then you must cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot reset the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument, either a sharp or a saw, to your power;
then remove what remains in the bone of harshness and small pieces of bark.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
Do so until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and properly if it is in summer; and do not put a plaster or anything else with oil on the wound, lest it cause rot and corruption;
then administer dressings once you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut away the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted by the break;
and many times foolish doctors have done this, and have brought either death or sores upon the patient; and let the constriction be softer and gentler than other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad accidents might come, as we have said, and you find pain in the area, then you should not put dressings on it; but wrap around, instead of dressings, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see pus forming around the wound after one or two days, then remove what you have put on it completely and put healing ointment on it, like tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you should loosen the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And the limb should be positioned in such a way that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass and it cannot heal but keeps forming pus again, know that there are small pieces of bone, so you must probe the wound with a probe and remove all those detached pieces that cause the pain.
And if a fistula forms in the area, or another type of corruption, you must treat it according to what he says in his chapter previously.
And when the bone is broken and exposed on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and other similar large limbs, do not pull it out, for many times death comes from it, but let it rot.
Perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can.
and if you cannot, leave it.
Many times they come after the healing of the break, especially when it is near the joint, and a painful sight is the shape of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care then if the wound is fresh: if the administrator gives astringent medicines, such as aloes, frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with astringent wine or with abundant egg white or with oil; and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for many days;
and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for many days; and then remove it, and start another, until the inflammation is gone;
or you bind over a piece of well-made lead; for the property of lead is such that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the inflammation has already become hard like stone, and it needs to be removed, then cut on top of it and remove the excess matter; or you scrape it with a scraper until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after the healing
When the broken bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and thin afterward, this happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or due to the multitude of ointments; or due to excessive movement, and not at the right time; or because there is little blood in his body, and he is weak.
And the treatment is that you should make the patient eat, and make his body soft, until the blood is multiplied in him; and give him baths, and give him joy and ease;
then put poultice on the limb, so that the poultice attracts great nourishment, and often water it with warm water, so that nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
a twisted limb after healing When the limb is twisted after restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the limb's form is ugly, nonetheless it does not lose its natural function:
So do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb anew, and many fools have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
However, if the knots and torments are fresh, they should be softened with hot water, or with softened herbs such as mallow leaves, roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with goose fat or sesame oil, and make a poultice on top;
or take softened figs, and crush them with flaxseed, and similar medicines that ease the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with moist hands. And movement should be administered to the limb every hour.
And if the swelling is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with an iron, then it should be cut down to the bone, with a sharp, light incisor; and apply compresses and study the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, so that it cannot move, and the limb is misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and injury.
When dislocation occurs to someone, it must now be immediately put back in place.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it is difficult to return it to its place.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to move it when it is swollen: Many times it causes swelling and other pains;
However, when this happens, let the patient be bled, then leave him until the abscesses are calmed;
then warm the limb with hot water and oil, then reset it gently, and treat each limb as it will return to its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
Sometimes the jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways: or they are slightly pulled from their places, and slightly softened; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and saliva flows from the mouth that he cannot hold, nor can he close his mouth, and wraps his tongue with speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by many dispositions.
And if it is complete and accomplished, you must reset it quickly, and delay not.
and in such a manner that the attendant holds the patient's head, and puts the tip of one of his hands into the root of the jaw dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is of two parts; and the other finger of the hand should be outside, to put it in line;
and instruct the patient that he soften his jaw and move it in all directions. And the attendant puts it straight, until it returns to its place.
And if the repositioning is difficult, especially if it is the two jaws together, then soak them with hot water and oil, until you reposition them gently;
Do not delay in repositioning, as we have said.
And when they are repositioned evenly, and the patient's mouth closes well without further softening, then place damp cloths, in a poultice made of rose oil and wax, and gently bind them with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on their back, with their head supported between two cushions, so that they do not move it to the right or left, nor strain to open their mouth, but eat light food, until the pain is gone, and the jaws are healed;
and then let them eat what they want lightly, and do not strain to open their mouth when eating and drinking, until the jaw is well healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be put back in place at once, and are not returned to their positions, fever and a familiar throbbing will result, and perhaps a loose bowel, and perhaps pure phlegm will be vomited.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal. and many times the one who experiences this dies within nine days.
The fork cannot dislocate from the inside of the ribs and breast, and is sometimes dislocated by the outside, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on their back, and extends their arms. and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then place the plaster and bandage over it, and bind it tight;
and the shoulder that is near the ribs cannot dislocate; if not, and if it dislocates at any time, then return it to its place, as we have said;
then place the plaster and the bandage on it, and bind it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and likewise the shoulder is put back in place, when it is separated from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways:
one of which is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and perhaps it dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind, because of the shoulder, and it does not dislocate inside because of the nerves;
and many times it dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, for in these it jumps quickly;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And perhaps it happens to some men through a blow or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated by this.
Therefore, you must test it, until you are certain. and then begin the treatment.
And dislocation is recognized when it is lower towards the armpit, and a difference is placed between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a clear difference between them. and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone. and the patient cannot bring their hand to their neck, nor move it with any movements.
and also, if it is dislocated upward, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly when touching.
and this type of dislocation is only to be reset, when it is new, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the minister lifts the patient's hand upward, then places their fingers under the armpit, and lifts the joint forcefully upward to its place. And the minister lifts the hand, and extends it upward, then puts it under. So it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in hot water; and the minister should administer a softening and soothing application, such as a decoction of marsh-mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
Then the patient should be placed on their back, and a piece of even wool, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the shoulder. Then the patient's heel should be placed on the wool, and the head of the shoulder should be lifted skillfully, and the patient's hand should be pulled;
and another minister should hold the patient's head so that it does not move down; that shoulder will return right away, and if you wish to see how to reset it in this manner:
and it is that you should have a man present who is taller than the patient; and stand upright towards the side, and place his shoulder under the patient's shoulder, and lift the shoulder upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another minister should pull the patient's arm downwards towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, let him hang with something heavy, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is reset also in another way:
and one places a long stick in the earth, of which the head is as round as a pestle, and is neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but let him have soft cloths on top, and the patient be standing upright along the length of the log;
then let his arm be stretched downward on the other side forcefully, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not wish to return despite all these things that we have said, then do this cure: take a stick of two arms of great and four fingers wide, which has a round head for the purpose of entering deeply under the armpit, according to this shape:
then tie soft cloths over the head of the log, so that the log does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the log, and tie the shoulder to the log, and the arm to the head of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of width, and let the hands be stretched downward, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint returns into place now.
And when it is in place, regardless of how, you must place a layer of equal wool under the armpit, then apply the prepared plaster of mill powder, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then bind tightly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to his neck, and let the hands remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal sooner;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and it is not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come to it, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries to three punctures, as it is set forth in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm upwards, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder is cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations near the breast, or behind, are caused by an impact and the stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered.
and treat until it is healed.
And if after healing, there is stiffness in the limb, and slowness in movement, the patient should use baths repeatedly until that stiffness is lessened and returns to its original nature.
Of the dislocation of the ribs
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated and returns.
and if it has dislocated from all sides, especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not corrected, for one can clearly see and feel it; and dislocated according to each shape. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can clearly see it. For the joint is broken, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch the shoulder at all.
And you must reset it before pus forms there, for if pus forms there, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be entirely reset, especially when it is at the back; so it is worse than other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps death comes from it.
And the restoration, when it is such that it can be reset, is that you extend its hand with your two hands; and its arms are spread out, and the hands of the mirror according to the knife around, above and below, and put the joint to its shoulders together, or to the root of its palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when it doubles its hand to its hand, and pushes from the root of the palm with the knife that is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, then administer strong extension;
and it is that two ministers extend the arm, and hold it two ministers, so that it does not move with the extension;
then turn the arm in each direction, after you have wrapped a double cloth long and wide;
and when the physician places the joint in its hand, then anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint forcefully, until it returns;
and when it is in its place, then apply a dry plaster with some egg-white, and bind it tightly, and hang the arm on the patient's neck, and leave it for several days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then untie the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint is not well aligned, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it thus for several days, until it is firmly positioned; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the joint has been reset, and it moves, then bathe and rub it well, and press until it is soothed; or you place a layer of fatty sheep's wool on the joint, then leave it for one day and one night, then remove it, and put it in the bath; and when it sweats, gently rub the joint, then replace the wool, and then put it in the bath; and do this two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, place moist, warm cow's hay with butter on top and bind it on;
it will return to its position.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than other joints. However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the area swells or a hot abscess forms there.
And the return is done by placing the affected hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and the physician positions it straight, so that the hand's palm is placed over the appearance of the joint and pushes until it returns.
However, you must check if it is properly in place; Then, the patient should place the back of their hand on a table during the extension and return. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, the patient places the back of their hand on the table, and the physician places their hand over the apparent area of the joint.
If it returns now, that is good. If not, apply soothing, poultices to the abscesses and leave it thus without resuming.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it back in place after a few days, the joint remains crooked.
and it does no harm to the patient other than that the hand is softened and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerve is cut, or the artery;
there is no other remedy but to cauterize nearby the case, and perhaps nothing else will help.
And when the hand is in place, put on the plaster that we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it thus.
And if it cannot be moved properly, and there is some stiffness, then moisten it with hot water and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly (palm side).
Then stretch the finger and push the dislocation back into its place until it returns, then support the head of the finger and bend it towards the part where it is disjoined;
and leave it for two days, and then put it in line that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it again at night;
and do this often, until it is straight, and likewise do this, if it is dislocated on the palm side of the hand, and do as you did before, until it is healed;
And likewise do this, when it is dislocated on the other side.
Regarding dislocation of the shin from the back.
When the shin from the back or from the neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death hastens the patient.
And the signs are that the bowels jump out involuntarily, and cannot be held, and many times certain limbs are softened, or both thighs, or both arms or one.
And many times the shin moves to four parts.
That which moves to the rear is called "gilbositez".
The cure is that you must wait if the gilbositez came from childhood: If there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from falling or impacts or similar things, the ancient ways of cures were described in grand pronouncements, where there is not much profit in all of them.
But I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gilbositez that comes to the chest beforehand, there is no remedy or health.
And also that which comes directly on the two sides, and one cannot cure except properly that which comes to the back, as I say.
And that the patient be laid stretched out on his face in a level place, and have padding underneath him, so that he does not injure himself.
Then place one burning brand in the ground at the head and another at the feet, and tie a band under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, knees, and ankles.
And two attendants should hold the bands, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two burning brands.
And let them be well fastened, the brands as we have said, and the physician place his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns to its place.
And if it does not return with this treatment, take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient lie on his side, and place the head of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board over the spine; And let the physician place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place.
And if you wish, do it with the turning device that turns by hand. And you should place two brands at the patient's head, one arm's length apart, and two others towards the feet, and have one palm's breadth of space between each brand, above and below.
And let there be one hole in each brand, through which the turning device runs, and let the brands be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move.
And between each two brands, let there be one revolving brand, on which the cords revolve, and let there be two small brands, one palm's length, on two pivots to turn the device.
And then tie the cord that is amongst the supports to the turning device towards the head, and the other cord towards the feet to the other turning device, and each of the assistants turns their turning device to the whole cord, and the master puts the spine straight as we have said.
And when it is straight, place a desiccant plaster with plenty of egg, then bandages, and then a strip of a tablet three fingers long, which should cover the place of the protrusion and the healthy part of the spine, then tie it with a bandage, as we have said, and the patient should use subtle nourishment until he is healed.
And if anything comes in the end to hinder healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the bandage that we have mentioned before. And sometimes a piece of lead is administered, and sometimes an appearance occurs in the rear spine of the back, and one thinks it to be a dislocation. And it is the bone that appears, for which one should not have any presumption. Perhaps it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations come, and nothing else like at other joints.
And the joint of the hip is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward elsewhere, and slightly dislocated forward and backward.
And the knowledge of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the patient's knee appears more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their diseased knee to the fire; and the place next to it is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of him to whom it comes outward is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the signs of him to whom it happens in front are that he extends his leg well according to its completion; However, he does not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make it go forward, it cannot, and he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when he walks, he walks on his heel.
And the signs of him to whom it happens behind are that he cannot extend or bend his knee, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place beneath the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you observe whether the dislocation is old, and it remains according to its position, in which case there is no cure; and it is not appropriate for it to have presumption.
And in that whose dislocation is fresh, and it is of the four types of dislocation, hasten to turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; Perhaps it will return, and requires no other treatment.
And if it does not return in this way, you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a strap tied around the knee; and another assistant extends their hand above it in such a manner that they place their hands under their armpits, then binds it gently with a strap around the thigh; and another holds the end of the strap;
and all pull upwards and downwards at the same time, until the patient is lifted from the ground all at once and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to four similar situations, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is good.
If not, then a cure must be applied to its likeness.
When the dislocation is inwards, you must lay the patient on their healthy side, then place the strap on the root of the thigh, and the place below the armpit, then pull the strap upwards towards the armpit and towards the shoulder;
then take another attendant by his arms and grasp the large part of the affected thigh, and extend it outwards forcefully: it will return to its place now;
and this type of dislocation is less severe than the others.
And if you cannot put it back in place in this way that we have described, you must tie the patient's two feet together with a strong soft strap around both ankles and both knees, and the affected leg should be extended two spans more than the other;
then let it hang from the top of a post, and be two arms' length above the ground;
then instruct one attendant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another attendant hang with the patient, embracing the thigh firmly, for the joint will now return quickly.
And when the dislocation is in the femur, the patient lies down, as we have said for those with hip disease, and a bandage is tightly applied to the affected leg and the foot as well;
then place two embers, one at the head and another at the feet, then place an ember between the patient's thighs in the middle of the form; and have moistened cloths draped around so they do not burn the patient, then each attendant should extend towards him, and the one who examines should place the dislocation even with their hand.
If it returns, that is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we have said for hip disease, and the patient lies on his sound side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and the examiner should put their effort on the affected hip, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the affected person downwards, nor lift them up from the ground, but it is necessary that they be positioned as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said about lying on both hips; and lie on their face, and the bandage is stretched as we have said before, and one should press on the joint against the table; and will be correct when the patient extends their legs, and they are equal; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster over it;
and if you see that they are equal, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and allow it to move gently, until the limb is strengthened.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inward and outward, and backward;
and does not dislocate forward.
And the signs are that you instruct the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not fit to his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration for all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and put your back on his face, and put his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee tightly; and another attendant extends his foot, so that the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he fits his leg to his thigh lightly;
and apply the plaster, and make the leg fit to the thigh, and bind them together firmly for three or four days, then unbind them;
and the patient does not exert himself to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not completely fixed, the attendant applies strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel.
The heel is sometimes dislodged, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inward and outward.
And the signs are that the ankle is swollen, and it protrudes toward the side where it is dislocated.
The reduction is gentle, and one should extend it gently with their hands when it is merely dislodged.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and have two assistants hold firmly on the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards your right hand, and then to the left hand twice, then extend it upward, and gently place the foot upward;
and do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot;
if it returns, that is good;
if not, then begin the work again, for it returns;
and if it cannot return thus, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly place one stick in the ground between their thighs, and tie straps around it, so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistants hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot to their hands or a rope, which they tie to the back of the foot; then each assistant should stretch equally, and the stick should be between the patient's thighs to hold the patient when stretching;
then let the surgeon place the dislocation in their hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, put the plaster and bandages on, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves which are above the ankle behind, that the bandage is not too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage softens, tighten it;
then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient to walk for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if boils appear there, you must relieve them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they should be gently straightened without difficulty, and it is an easy matter.
And if the dislocation is in any part of the back of the foot, you must make the patient sit on a flat surface or a table, perfectly straight, and place your foot on the exposed joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns to place.
and when it is aligned and nothing is visible, place a board under the sole of the foot, with two supports, then hold it firmly, and leave it for three days, then release it. and keep it at rest until it is healed.
of wound and dislocation together.
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies.
So do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and have not used it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and patient, and not rash;
and use at first things to soothe the hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, then immediately restore the limb to its place, so that the hot abscess comes to it;
and when the limb is in place, then administer things to soothe the hot abscess, and treat the wound as is necessary, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then set them, and do what we have said in simple ailments;
and beware of entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for this will be a test from your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and body.
