On the bloodletting of veins.
Chapter 97.
The veins to be bloodlet, which are customary in the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins behind the ears, called the two "Herbs"; two arteries visible in the temples; two veins in the tear ducts of the two eyes, called "Lookers"; a vein situated in the middle of the forehead; and a vein at the tip of the nose.
And two "Guidegi" veins in the neck.
And two veins on the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins on the lower lip.
And these are the veins called "Algecherich."
And two veins under the tongue.
However, in the arms, there are five veins in each arm to be bloodlet.
One of them is the Cephalic, located on the outer side; the common people call it the "head vein."
And the Dark vein.
And there is the Middle vein, formed from a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic; the common people call it the "body vein."
And the Basilic, positioned on the inner side, also called "Titillicaris."
And the common people call it the "belly vein."
And the Cord of the arm, positioned above the elbow joint; this is the one bloodlet, visible above the thumb with clear appearance.
And the Salvatic vein, located between the ring finger and the little finger, with two branches.
In the leg and foot, there are three veins.
One of these is located under the arch of the big toe on the outer side.
The second is the Saphenous, located near the heel on the inner side.
And the Nesse vein, located near the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg, there are three veins similar to these.
On the bloodletting of the two veins behind the ears.
Bloodletting of the two veins behind the ears is beneficial for chronic catarrh, migraines, "sahafati," and old sores of the head.
And the method of bloodletting it is as I will describe.
The patient’s head is to be shaved, and the occiput is rubbed at the location of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well.
Then the patient should tightly bind his neck with a band until the two veins appear.
Their locations are behind the ears in two sunken spots of the head.
Therefore, locate them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark the spot with ink.
Then take the lancet knife, called the "Incisor."
Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone.
Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein along with the skin with a cutting incision.
The length of the incision should be about the width of two joined fingers, or around that; let as much blood flow as you desire.
Then compress it with pads, and leave it until it heals.
And their incision and cauterization were already covered at the beginning of the book.
On the bloodletting of the two arteries in the temples.
Bloodletting of the two arteries in the temples is beneficial for chronic migraines, a persistent throbbing, continuous eye pain, and the flow of excessive discharges to the eyes.
And the method of bloodletting them is as I will describe to you.
The patient should tightly bind his neck until the two veins become clearly visible to the touch, and their pulse is felt under your finger.
Then mark them with ink.
Then lift the skin above the vein upward with your index finger, insert the cutting lancet underneath, and raise the vein upwards.
And cut it as you did with the other two veins, allowing the blood to flow according to your need.
Then release the patient’s binding and press your finger over the vein for an hour.
Afterward, place a dressing and pads on it, and bind it tightly from above; leave it until it heals.
And their mention, incision, and extraction were already covered at the beginning of the book.
On the bloodletting of the frontal vein after the bloodletting of the Cephalic.
The benefit of bloodletting the frontal vein after the bloodletting of the Cephalic is for old ailments of the face, for migraines, redness, and foul ulcers.
And the method of its bloodletting is as I will tell you.
The patient should tightly bind his neck with a band until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument called the "Digger."
Whose shape is as follows.
Place the pointed tip that is on the head of the Digger over the vein, and strike it with a comb or something similar, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you desire.
Then release the perforation of the patient, and press it until it heals.
Sometimes it is opened with a broad lancet.
However, it is not necessary for the lancet to have a sharp end like other lancets; rather, it should have a broad end.
And bloodlet it across, since the bone is close, and perhaps the lancet might break in it if it is fine.
On the bloodletting of the veins in the two tear ducts.
The benefit of the two veins in the two tear ducts of the eyes is for the eye suffering from scabies and redness, and "sebel" in the eye, and ailments of the face.
The method of their bloodletting is for the patient to tightly bind his neck with a band.
Then bloodlet them while you stand above his head.
And the bloodletting should be done horizontally in a short length, with a small lancet, somewhat broad, as there is no flesh in that place.
If the lancet has a fine end, it may break.
Then let as much blood flow as you need.
And place a dressing on them, bind them for one night, then release them.
On the bloodletting of the nasal veins.
The bloodletting of the nasal veins is helpful for acute fever, severe throbbing, and ailments of the face, like migraines and redness that appears in the face, especially when it is old.
The method of its bloodletting is for the patient to tightly bind his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, take a fine, long lancet, and fix it in the middle of the cartilage, between what divides the nose straight down.
For the vein is not felt there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary to hold your hand with the lancet for a short time, and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then bind it for one night.
For it heals quickly.
On the bloodletting of the Guidegi veins.
The benefit of bloodletting the two Guidegi veins is for constriction of breath, the onset of leprosy, melancholic ailments, impetigo, foul ulcers, and corrosive conditions, that is, scaly herpes.
The method of their bloodletting is for the patient to bind under both in his neck with a strap, and for the practitioner to stand above the patient’s head while the patient sits on a seat.
Then bloodlet the vein in a somewhat large length.
Then extract a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see is needed.
Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterward, release the binding and press the two veins with moderate pressure so that the patient is not suffocated.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound heals.
On the bloodletting of the Algeberich veins.
The benefit of bloodletting the Algeberich veins is that it helps with the ulcerations in the mouth, the corruption of the gums, foul ulcers, cracks in the lips, and even foul ulcers in and around the nose.
The method of bloodletting them is to have the patient sit before you and to bind his neck with a band.
Then turn his lip, and look at the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, both identified by their dark color.
And that is true, as around them are tiny, dark veins.
Then make an incision in each one.
But if you are in doubt and do not know which one, then focus on the incision of the larger and more visible one.
Similarly, do the same with the two veins in the upper lip; this is often customary, and incise the two veins in the lower lip.
On the bloodletting of the vein under the tongue after the Cephalic bloodletting.
The benefit of bloodletting the two veins under the tongue is that the Cephalic bloodletting helps with obstructions in the throat, ailments of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.
The method of bloodletting them is to have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun, lift his tongue, and look under the tongue for a vein on each side, both with a darkish color.
Therefore, bloodlet each one, and take care not to press your hand too much in bloodletting them.
For beneath them are arteries, and there may be a blood flow from those arteries.
On the three veins in the elbow.
The three veins in the elbow that are bloodlet are commonly treated in all people.
Their bloodletting is done in two ways.
Either by pricking with a broad myrtle-shaped lancet, or an olive-shaped one with a fine edge, or by cutting with a knife-shaped lancet, called "Alnesil."
And this is its shape.
Thus, the Alnesil is suitable for incisions.
And among them are types that are broad and fine, according to the width of the veins and their narrowness. The shape of the myrtle-shaped lancet should be broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening hollow, full, projecting, visible, thick veins that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this lancet is of lesser width and a finer tip.
And it is suitable for the bloodletting of fine veins that contain thin, yellowish blood.
On the bloodletting of the Basilica vein.
The bloodletting of the Basilica vein, which is one of these three veins, is beneficial.
It draws blood from ailments that are below the throat and neck, following down to the chest and abdomen. The bloodletter must be cautious when bloodletting it, as there is an artery beneath it.
If an error is made, and too much force is applied in the lancet puncture, it will cut that artery, resulting in a blood flow.
Therefore, it is necessary not to use a puncturing lancet but rather to cut with the Alnesil.
If the Basilica is not clearly visible, then it is necessary to change to another vein or seek one of its branches, or instead bloodlet the Cord of the arm.
The Cord of the arm is clearly visible, so cut it with the Alnesil, as we mentioned.
If you wish to bloodlet the Basilica itself, you should press the arm beforehand to feel for the pulse location.
Then mark the spot with ink, bind the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the Alnesil, as we described.
Be cautious not to let the cut fall near the artery.
And if you see an inflation at the marked spot when you bind it, that inflation is from the artery; therefore, avoid it.
If you see the blood spurting at the bloodletting site like a child’s urine, and it is thin, red blood, then know that it is from the artery.
Then act quickly and place your finger on it for a long moment, then remove your finger.
If the blood flow stops (for it often stops), then bind the arm, and let it be, advising the patient to refrain from moving it and to be cautious.
And he should not move it for a few days until it heals.
But if the blood does not stop and overwhelms you, and no remedy is at hand, then cut the artery if you can see it.
For its ends will contract, stopping the blood.
Or take the bark of a pistachio tree, split it, take one half, and bind it over the vein with appropriate pressure using a band and pads until the next day.
Then if the blood stops, it is good.
And if not, then treat it with what has previously been mentioned from the location of the powders that stop blood flow; stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases due to the small wound and the possibility of binding from the arm.
On the bloodletting of the Fusca vein.
The bloodletting of the Fusca vein is beneficial as it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body, due to its composition from a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalic, as we mentioned.
The bloodletter should exercise caution in bloodletting it, as there is a nerve beneath it.
If too much force is applied in the lancet puncture and the nerve is struck, numbness will occur, and healing will be difficult, perhaps even incomplete.
This nerve is often felt.
If it is hidden in some people and is fine and not visible, then it is necessary to position your bloodletting with the Alnesil and avoid the nerve with caution.
If the vein lies between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
On the Cephalic vein.
The bloodletting of the Cephalic vein is beneficial as it draws blood from the head and helps with ailments of the eyes.
And it is appropriate with this vein, if you wish, to bloodlet it by pricking with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped lancet, as it is the safest of all veins, as there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
However, in bloodletting, it is best to avoid only the head of the upper arm and seek a softer spot; and it does no harm if it is not found on the first try, allowing for several attempts.
However, some people may develop a small abscess if it is not bloodlet on the first try, but this abscess does not harm them in any way.
On the usefulness of bloodletting, and the precautions to observe in it.
The nature of bloodletting and its complications, about which you must think to correct.
Firstly, you must know that bloodletting is only practiced for the preservation of health, its persistence, and as a precaution against the onset of diseases.
And so that bloodletting may be done on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Dark, and the Basilic.
And so that bloodletting may be done at the start of Spring before fasting, in spring and summer, and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And let bloodletting be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since daybreak.
However, bloodletting practiced in illnesses does not have a fixed hour; rather, when convenience and necessity call for it, it may be done at night, or day, and at any hour, and at any time.
And children should not be bled until they have reached fourteen years of age.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Nor should the elderly, who have already passed sixty years, be bled.
Therefore, when anyone wants to be bled for any reason, they should cleanse their intestines before bloodletting with a gentle enema, if much stool is retained, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines putrid superfluities that harm the principal organs during bloodletting.
Nor should a person suffering from toctina, that is, a nauseating fullness, nor a gluttonous one, nor one recovering from drunkenness, be bled until these conditions are cleared from them.
Nor should a person sick with dropsy.
And bloodletting should also be avoided after an episode of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and anything that depletes strength from the body or mind.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick from foods, drinks, and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prevents it; or engage in some exercise, to make the blood more fluid.
And place his bloodletting in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we said: and strive so that his chest may be cleared that day of all harmful emotional occurrences, such as distress, anger, and fear; and of all physical events, such as labor, pain, excessive intercourse, and similar things.
And let him have present at his seat things with which people are accustomed to use, such as spices, perfumes, music, and similar items, as much as possible.
Then let the bloodletter sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one being bled; afterward, extend his arm, and the bloodletter should rub it with his hand two or three times.
Then let him bind the ligament with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the binding be moderate, for when the binding is uneven, or too tight, it then hinders the flow of blood; or if too loose, it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then, after binding, the one to be bled should rub his hands together until the veins are engorged and visible to the touch.
Then the bloodletter should wipe the lancet with a little aged oil.
Then he should place the index finger of his left hand slightly on the vein itself below the spot where he intends the bloodletting, so that the vein does not slip away and the incision misses.
For among the veins there are some that you find to flee like a string during bloodletting: and among them are those full of air, and when you place the lancet over it, it contracts under the lancet, deceiving the bloodletter, who then does not open the vein; and even if he does open it, it is narrow. Therefore, the bloodletter must be steady and careful in all these things.
Then he should put down the lancet.
If then the vein opens with one attempt, that is good.
And if not, then repeat it with another attempt a little below or above that spot, with quickness, unless the area becomes inflamed.
But if the area becomes inflamed, or the patient grows fearful, then leave him for a day or two, and do not tie the binding.
For it may draw a warm inflammation.
Nor should he enter a bath.
Then let him repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear the desired amount may not exit, then insert the lancet again in the same opening straightly and add a bit to the procedure.
And do this quickly, before the area becomes inflamed, for in many people, a small procedure leads to an inflamed area.
If you see that it is already inflamed, then do not repeat on it at all, for nothing excuses it to you.
And place something of the oil sediment on it, for it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this case than oil itself or other oils.
Similarly, use oil sediment in all your bloodlettings, in which you treat veins with a restriction on blood flow: alfarach antidote and sagzenea do this when one of them is placed on the area.
For the blood is thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
But if a large inflammation occurs at the site of bloodletting, as often happens, especially to one who has only been bled that time, or if the vein opening is small, then quickly place a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly heated, on the area, and press it for an hour, for it will dissolve.
And you should do this after the blood has exited from that vein fully, or from another vein.
If, after some days, something dark or green remains in the area, it is not harmful; and if you wish, place on it some dissolved aloe or myrrh, or something of the juice of pennyroyal, that is, calamint or something similar.
And indeed, often inflammations and swellings occur with bloodletting of the Basilic vein.
Therefore, place your hand on it, and if you find softness upon your pressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Be careful, then, not to place on it anything from what we have mentioned.
For blood from the artery may flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with something astringent, so that the area becomes firm.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
And you must extract blood from every person according to the measure of his strength.
And from what appears as the dominant color in the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it becomes red; similarly, if you see it thick, then let it flow until it becomes thinner; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And if someone is full, strong, and requires blood extraction all at once, the bloodletting incision should be widened, and the lancet should be broad; and for someone who is weak, the opposite should be done.
And it should be drawn out in stages, and the opening should be narrow: the best method in venous bloodletting is a transverse cut, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from excessive blood flow and from cutting a nerve: it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting along the width or length.
For one who is accustomed to experiencing fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary to feed him before bloodletting a small amount of bread soaked in water with pomegranate juice, or secaniabin if he is warm; and draw blood from him in three or four sessions.
If his constitution is cold, then he should take before the bloodletting bread soaked in syrup of quince, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in a fragrant aromatic syrup.
But if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and it is due to excessive blood loss, he should then drink meat broth and a fine, fragrant syrup, use aromatics with musk, anoint his chest with it, and use the other remedies we have discussed in the section on fainting from evacuation.
For one who wishes to let his arm breathe and release blood a second time: if the bloodletting is for significant evacuation and he has weak strength, he should release blood gradually according to his strength over continuous days.
However, if he wishes to let his arm breathe and release blood a second time and he is strong, then he should do so after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
For one who wishes to draw blood from his body opposite to the side where it tends to accumulate, it should be let on the second or third day.
But if there is much blood in his body that has already become warm and sharp, causing fever, blood must exit in one session, and a large quantity should be drawn, with the incision widened until fainting occurs, all while observing all the conditions of bloodletting. Place your hand on his pulse during the blood flow, so that death does not occur in place of fainting.
For this often happens when the bloodletter is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
And it is not appropriate, when you wish to release the arm and draw blood a second time, with the vein's orifice now closed and the blood's exit becoming difficult, to press on it forcefully and to quickly extend it after bending.
For this is very harmful; instead, leave it until it can be bloodlet a second time.
Or carefully remove what has coagulated from the blood in the vein’s opening, and place on it something of salt dissolved in water.
And place on it something from alfaroch or sagzenea, applying it with gentle compression until the blood exits.
But if the vein is already inflamed, then leave it and do not cover it until the inflammation subsides.
If necessity demands releasing blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either bloodlet above that spot or on the other arm in a different vein.
The cord of the arm is bloodlet at the location of the Fusca and Basilic veins, when they cannot be found and are hidden, as it is formed from them.
And the manner of this bloodletting is that the patient should place his hand in warm water until the palm reddens, and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then it should be lightly bound over the vein with moderate constriction.
Then, bloodlet it gradually across, not horizontally nor lengthwise; the opening should be wide, and your incision for bloodletting should be slightly above the wrist joint.
If the blood flow is restricted, then immerse the hand in warm water again, and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your goal.
If it is during the summer, then you are excused from reimmersing the hand in warm water.
And indeed, the flow of blood is most often placed in warm water during winter.
Bloodletting from this vein is safer than from all other veins, as there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
Bloodletting from the Salvatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
The manner of this bloodletting is to bind the mahason of the hand with a band or your own hand, after immersing it in warm water until the vein swells and becomes easily palpable.
Then, bloodlet it by making a transverse incision.
And if you cut it entirely, it will cause no harm at all.
Take care not to apply excessive pressure with your hand when using the bloodletting instrument.
For beneath it lie the finger nerves, exposed without much flesh.
Then, immerse the hand in warm water again and allow the blood to flow into it.
If you do not immerse it again in warm water, the blood coagulates in the vein’s opening, blocking the flow.
Once you have drawn the necessary amount of blood, apply oil and salt to the vein to prevent rapid closure.
And you should do likewise with any narrow branch vein.
The benefit of bloodletting from the left hand is that it aids ailments of the spleen; perform this bloodletting in the same way as for the right hand.
Bloodletting from the saphenous vein is beneficial for ailments in the lower body, such as uterine conditions, menstrual retention, kidney ailments, chronic ulcers on the hips and legs, and similar conditions.
The manner of bloodletting from this vein is for the patient to place his foot in warm water and rub it until the veins swell, then bind it above the ankle with a strap.
The location of the vein is near the heel, appearing toward the big toe, and it branches out with many branches over the surface of the foot.
Bloodlet from a larger branch of it, or at its cluster near the heel, as this is better and safer.
If you bloodlet it from the top of the foot, take care to avoid the nerves that lie beneath the surface.
And position your incision for bloodletting transversely, as if you intend to cut it; the incision should be Nesil.
If the blood flow is restricted, immerse the foot in warm water again and let the blood flow into it until evacuated.
If the bloodletter misses the vein on the first try, then retry slightly above, as the area is safe, and there is no need to worry about harm if you avoid the nerves as instructed.
Do likewise for the saphenous vein of the other foot.
The location of the sciatic vein, as we have said, is near the heel on the outer side.
Bloodletting from it relieves hip pain when caused by hot blood.
The manner of bloodletting is for the patient to enter a bath and hurry, then tie his leg from the side of the hip down to above the heel with a long, narrow band four fingers wide, as it is not visible otherwise.
When it becomes visible, bloodlet it in whatever way you find possible, or transversely, which is better, or by making a cut or incision.
Its location is safer, and in most people, it is very concealed.
If you cannot find it and it is entirely hidden to the senses, then bloodlet from one of its branches, namely the one that appears on the top of the foot toward the little toe; avoid the nerves, and allow the desired amount of blood to flow.
Then loosen the binding, place leather over the bloodletting site, and bind the area.
It will heal quickly.
