Chapter 20:
On the treatment of swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.
Many times this swelling occurs at the site of a healed fracture, especially if it is near the joints, and it deforms the shape of the limb; and it often prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and apply astringent medicines such as aloe, incense, myrrh, Serapias, and aristolochia, or similar; so take some or all of these and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply it to the swelling with tow, and compress it well.
And leave the bandage in place without loosening it for many days; then loosen it and reapply another until the swelling is reduced; or compress it with a lead plate, because lead has the property of removing all swelling from limbs.
But if the swelling has already hardened and is tight, and it is necessary to remove it quickly, then cut it at the uppermost part, and incise the excess and prominent parts, or scrape it with some rasp until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.
