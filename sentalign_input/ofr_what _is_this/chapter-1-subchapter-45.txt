of the rupture of the peritoneum/abdominal wall
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines descend into the scrotum, and it is recent, it is necessary that when you see to treat it, that he does not eat anything that day; and that he consumes things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his belly; afterward, have him sit on his back between your hands, and tell him to hold his breath until the intestines are replaced, and put them back with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and another incision that resembles half a circle above the body; then heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:
until it is white and throws sparks.
Then put the intestines back in their place; and let the assistant hold his hand there so they don't return; and open the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion under him and an attendant on his thighs, and another on his chest who holds his hands; then place the cautery on the incision with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you don't reach it the first time, do it again until you reach the bone; and be very careful that the intestines do not protrude when you apply the cautery; so that you do not burn them; and that because of this the patient does not die, or suffer other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And the cautery for children must be small according to their size, and for adults, large according to their size; after three days treat the cauterized area with butter until the burning sensation is gone; then treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well closed; and his food should be easily digested for a long time, so that the intestines do not protrude when he gets up to go to the toilet.
And after forty days, when he wants to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and he should wear it for another forty days; and he should have good rest, and work little and avoid overfilling himself with drink and food, and shouting too loudly; and when he follows these instructions he will be completely healed.
And I will discuss the treatment of cutting in its own chapter.
of the rupture of the abdomen/belly
When ruptures appear in other bellies and are recognizable, and you see that they are not growing larger, make a round cautery burn according to its size, and let a third of the core be burned; afterwards treat it as we have described; and some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery in this way:
But first mark the place with ink and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside it, and hold your hand in the middle with the heated cautery.
But the first cauterization is lighter and gentler.
