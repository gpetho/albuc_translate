of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not work, then you must cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place his head on your lap; and have an assistant hold his head between his hands so it does not move; then place cotton soaked in egg white or parsley juice on the eye; afterward heat the cautery which is shaped like the quill of a vulture, with the cautery at the end; if you wish, it can be pointed from one end to the other, or it can be shaped like a tent; but in any case, the quill-shaped one is very useful for your work.
Afterward press the fistula if it is open, and extract the pus and dry it; if it is closed, open it and remove the pus; then apply the hot cautery strongly, holding your hand steady over the fistula on the upper part of the eye, so your hand does not slip; place the cautery in the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery, it would be good. If not, repeat the cautery again, and again if needed, and leave it for three days; afterward apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat with drying ointment until healed; and if forty days pass without healing, apply sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and shave it according to what is mentioned in its chapter.
There is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients mentioned. Open the fistula, and split the place; afterward place a small chamomile flower in the split, of which this is the shape:
and make it to the size of one ounce of lead; and hold your hand firmly on the chamomile, and do not let the patient move, so that the melted lead does not flow into his eye; and it is necessary to place cotton soaked in egg white or water on the eye: the lead burns the fistula and heals it marvelously.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery we mentioned, it is good. If not, it is necessary to administer punctures to the nerve, and bring the fistula to the core of the nerve as needed in its proper place.
