Of the fracture of the leg
Know that the leg has two bones, one is rightfully called "mustel," and the other is called "foscile"; and fractures occur just as they do in the arm, and for this reason, the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the work is all one.
And if both bones are fractured together, the leg will twist in all directions.
And if the thin bone is fractured, it twists forward.
And if the thick bone is fractured, there is great pain, and it is easily seen; and it twists downward. Then administer extension, and set it evenly, and bind the splints evenly; but if the fracture is severe, and there are several pieces, then the extension should be less and more gentle; and adjust it according to your skill.
And when you have completed all your work, take two carved wooden pieces that embrace the leg on both sides, and are as long as the leg from the knee down; then wrap in two places a bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle as well, and this way the leg cannot incline to the right or left, and so it is good; and some use a long board for the leg, made of wood, and place the leg in it to prevent movement, and this is done especially when the fracture has a wound; and move the leg every day to see if there is a hot abscess or another issue; treat it until it is healed.
