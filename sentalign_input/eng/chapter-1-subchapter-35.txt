 CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE.
On cauterization of warts after excision.
 When you excise warts, heat a spike-shaped cautery and bring it, hot, to the site of the excised wart, and press down till the cautery reaches the mouth of the vessel whence the blood comes.
Do this once or twice over.
If the warts be more than one, sear each one separately as we have described ; then dress with suitable ointments till healed.
And if you burn the patient with one big cauterization over the lumbar region that will add to the effect.
