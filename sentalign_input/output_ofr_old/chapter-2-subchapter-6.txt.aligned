About the blockage of the ears	On the treatment of things that fall into the ear.	0.495831
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an insect, or a stone from a mine or similar thing like iron; or seeds, like barley, beans, peas; or flowing substances like water and vinegar and similar things.	All that falls into the ear comes under four categories: mineral stone, or what resembles stone, such as iron or glass; vegetable grain such as pea or date-stone or the like; or liquid such as water or vinegar; or animal.	0.8698416
When a stone or other type of thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear and does not grow in the ear, place the ear in the sun. If you see the stone, then distill a little violet oil or sesame oil, then administer extraction; and make the person sneeze with pepper, and plug the nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and hold the ear upwards. Often it comes out by this treatment; and if it does not come out, then administer extraction with delicate pincers, which have this form:	When a stone or something of that sort that does not grow gets into the ear, turn the ear toward the sun. If you see the stone, pour upon it a little oil of violets or sesame; then try to get it out by moving the head or by inducing sneezing with ptarmica and keeping the nose closed at the onset of sneezing, having first made round the ear a circle of pieces of cloth or wool and drawn the ear upwards. This treatment will usually bring it out. But if it does not come out, try to get it out with a fine pair of tweezers shaped thus.	0.8923899
If it jumps out with pincers, that is good; if not, then administer extraction with a delicate hook of small size; and if it does not come out by this, then make a bronze tube and place the end of the tube in the ear hole tightly, and seal what is around the tube with soft wax so that air cannot enter with the tube; then pull it out strongly, for often it comes out as we have said; and if it does not come out in this manner, then take glue used for catching birds, and place it on an instrument that is suitable for this purpose, and put a little cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever it is, and pull it out. And if it does not come out by all these means that we have mentioned, then hurry to cut the ear before a hot abscess comes, and spasms; and the manner of the cut is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to his strength, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small cut at the root of the ear in the soft part at the dependent place; and let the cut be like a crescent, until you reach the stone, then remove it as best you can, and suck it quickly with your mouth; and treat it until it is healed. And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, then administer extraction; and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin, delicate spatula in this form:	And if this does not bring it out, make a bronze tube and introduce the end of the tube well into the meatus of the ear and fill in round with wax softened with oil so that there may be no outlet save through the tube; then suck it out with all your breath; it will often come out with this. But if it does not come out with these means we have described, take turpentine resin or bird-lime, a very little; twist some compact cotton wool on the end of a probe and put this on the tip; then introduce it gently into the ear after you have dried out all the moisture from the ear. But if your treatment so far is unavailing, then be quick and incise before an abscess or spasm supervene. Now this is the way to incise: first, the patient's cephalic vein should be cut and blood drawn, in proportion to his strength; then seat the patient in front of you and turn his ear upwards; make a small incision at the lobule of the ear in the depression there (the incision should be crescent-shaped) until you reach the stone; then extract it with whatever instrument you may.	0.9285645
and administer incision of the grain. But do not do this when you think that the grain is moist from the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it; then extract it with delicate pincers and by suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.	You should not do this except when you are sure that this grain has become moist by reason of the vapours of the ear, so that you may cut up the grain into several small pieces. Then you may extract them with a blunt hook or fine-headed tweezers, or by suction, as we have mentioned; for their extraction will be easy.	0.75223625
In the extraction of an insect, if it is small-bodied, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is large-bodied and can be felt, then administer extraction with pincers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.	As for the extraction of a creature getting into the ear, look to see if it is small of body, such as a flea or the like, in which case treat by those means mentioned in the section. But if it has a large body, conspicuous to the touch, try to get it out with tweezers and hooks; for of all things that stick in the ear this is the easiest to extract.	0.8555156
In the extraction of worms bred in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sunlight: if any worms appear, then extract them with delicate pincers, and if they do not appear, then take a tube of which this is the form:	As for the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you have unavailingly treated it by those methods mentioned in the section in the treatise on instillations, you will need to examine the ear in the sunlight; and if you can see any worms, extract with tweezers or fine hooks.	0.7823685
