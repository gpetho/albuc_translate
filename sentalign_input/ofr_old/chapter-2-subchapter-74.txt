of abscesses of the uterus
Many types of abscesses come in the womb, such as cankers, hard abscesses, herpes, estiomenes, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and hot abscesses, and many other diseases mentioned in the division. I will now describe the hot abscess that comes in the womb, which is not one of those that collect pus; if you want to know the work of the iron, check if the abscess is acute at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it.Then do not hurry to pierce, but let it mature until the pain subsides; then make the patient sit on a chair, with two small chairs where he can lean, support his back, and bring his feet together on the outside of the leg; his thighs should be spread, and his arms under his knees, and tie them well with a good tie; then suck the boil toward the right side, and use the instrument that opens the mouth of the womb, which is described later; and when you want to use this instrument, first insert the probe to know the depth of the womb so that the instrument does not go deeper than it should and does not harm the patient; if the instrument is larger, cover the depth of the womb with cloths so that the instrument does not hurt her; and the instrumentâ€™s cone should be above, and he should hold the instrument. When the abscess appears, and you pierce it with a soft hand, it should be cut at the head, with a blunt spatula; when the pus is drained, it is necessary to place tents moistened with rose oil, or with dry green oil; place the tent outside the wound at the depth of the womb, and place above on the womb and the base of the penis clean wool moistened in water or cooked mallows; then treat it after two days with appropriate ointment until it is healed; sometimes the womb and wound are washed with a clyster of water and honey, and then water with lily roots and long aristolochia cooked; then return to the ointment. If the wound is deep in the womb, avoid using iron, but treat it as we said in the division.
