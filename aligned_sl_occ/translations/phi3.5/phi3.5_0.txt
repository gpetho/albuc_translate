Oh children, you have completed this book, which is on the edge of medical science due to its compliments from him herein, and through his expositions and declarations, I see that you are complexing it with great interest; for in doing so, we delve into matters beyond simple operation—into surgery.
When the operation is prostrate in our region and at all times private, only then will I observe my science of it; until now nothing has been seen by me except some small descriptions found freely among Ancient texts, which I change into errors leading to their current ignorance, thereby closing off intentions therein and elongating the art.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May be the reason why no skilled artisan forsakes his craft here in our time, as medicine is long-standing and it behooves its practitioner to exercise diligently within the science of anatomy—which Galen knew well by understanding the proper use of their limbs and forms; including joint connectivity/disconnection (conjunctio e separacio), bone structure, nerves, ligaments, names thereof, as well as arterial pulsations and resting places in bodily organs.
Through which water of Hippocrates is drawn for its name's sake, may it be small in the work and primarily within the craft of medicine.
May we already have discussed this in the entrance of this book; who does not know what has been told to them about anatomy, will fall into error and serve uselessly as dead men cannot tell us anything, although they may appear knowledgeable about these things, for those are formed by this science and learn from it.

Here comes another doctor who commands that the patient drink a stone of wine which had progressed in its state, and this stone was large; they brought it to their throat with a straw from the cup, so that by the third day, that home (stone) expired.
And when they call for it (referring to the patient), and due to the greatness of the stone and the positioning of the bladder, bring under control so that death may occur.

And for you (the doctor), it is necessary that the operation be planned in two ways: one related to health and another where there is risk involved.

Wine also enters some of your mouths. Not a physician of disease can be named who does not understand this condition.
And you have already delved into this book for the second time through these three chapters.
Begins with the division of free will, and firstly from the primary partition. The ordered first chapter within the foot, in terms of instruments and iron tools for cautioners, what is necessary herein?
The division of the second part. The Second Chapter on stone and puncture, and of vials, and of pus extraction from herbs and similars; all this has been organized according to the forms of instruments.
The third pillar of restoration and displacement, as well as the healing of twists and appearances for these patients; head positioned within their bodies using tools appropriately chosen by physicians.
When you determine the quality of that poultice and its application for him, where it is forbidden to apply treatment in which way?
So say that the discourse on the quality of cautery and its use in this context is long and elaborate, subtle by science, and secretly intended; they speak much about it extensively, and their opinions are often at odds with each other, which suffices for me.
And so it is said that the pointed instrument comforts throughout the entire body universally, except for two types of parts, which are considered tail ends of his material.
In the complex tail and dry matter; they disperse humors that heal at that place, while others introduce contrary humors which are not suitable for illness characterized by its quality and dryness, wherein it is necessary to apply moisture-rich water therewithally treated (cured) so as the complex tail'dictly affected can be made healthy again.
Here comes the first sentence to translate:
Through the speech of that person, I have already discovered some things for myself.
Even if it's necessary to use cautery above what has already been excised and exercised in the capital of treatments for today' extrication tools, understanding the complexity of human composition and how diseases are arranged within them, as well as their causes and accidents (symptoms), and also considering the time span of these conditions.
When in other complications, it is not out of fear but mainly due to chill and moist humors; all doctors agree on these matters, and they certainly use caustic agents therein without concern for their own health.
And those who understand the secret of healing by fire and the benevolence of this practice (the use of heat in medicine), they realize that it is simple, for the effect of which only reaches the part where cauterization was applied, not affecting another member on earth except through minor harm.
May the medicine burn reach that which has been lying within him in his ill member, and with force it will enter into the sick body part and bring forth healing.
May the focus (or point), due to its sublimity and beneficial nature, does not create excess but rather heals; we have learned about this through experimentation and long periods of study in the art concerning truths regarding causes; therefore it excuses from lengthy speech. Herein lies our secret knowledge at your disposal during this pause (or rest period), which demonstrates a medical discourse that enlightens us, shining brightly within these pages to aid those suffering with diseases.
Indeed, wise ones say that it is best at the beginning of life to perform cauterizations and intervals when times are most favorable in early infancy.
E you say that cautery is convenient at all times, for the harm caused by water retained in the cautery will be drawn out and mostly when there are pains or necessary tools like needles, which do not suffer from delay due to fear of these potential evils; greater danger lies in small injuries occurrthy.
So do not sit in your feet, or on the ground for you and your peasants/common people are considered rather than physicians; hence recovery from this ailment through cauterization is not complete immediately, causing delays (or consequences).
E the cause is not in what they suffer from nowhere; these cauterizations are only done where medicine changes and dries up the fluids which are the reason for coming pains.
Even if excessive use of caustics is necessary in medicine due to the patient' extraneous humor and the greatness of their operation, it should be done judiciously.

The translation of this medieval medical treatise line by line into English is as follows:
Second Chapter.
Of the pointed cautery of the head (or tool/instrument for
When in the entire head there is chronic and long-lasting pain, which extends into the spleen (suggestive of accumulation or imbalance within this organ), and uses cupping, knitting needles, lancets for bloodletting, lancing instruments, poultices, mock fumigations with heated stones/herbs ("guazzes"), chest ointments, and decoctions (possibly indicating a range of treatments aimed at drawing out humors or toxins), especially if any such treatment has already been applied without providing relief from the causes: it is then considered that there may be excessive hardness in the spleen's nature; hence no needless violent manipulation, as another cautery (another instrument for bloodletting) will now address this issue. When applied over the top of one'se head for curing, it serves with caution while the neck is divided open. Cut the bone and expose its quantity that we have recorded and seal it with a cautery at the back part of the head where it has been called upon to act—this is the place where suction was applied. And raise your hand so high, and do not touch the abdomen, for here comes a pain different from those pains caused by other cautions applied to the head.
Here enters the cautery in its place, four times as much that this same cautery has already treated the corns of the head and back under subtle caustics, which is how it should be done.

If the amount of humidity that has been retained by the cushion is sufficient for you to hold your hand over it such that the blood vessel does not become constricted (and thus preventing bleeding), then this ensures no flow of bile.

When treating the ancient migratory ailment you've mentioned, and considering what has been discussed about its divisions or maladies previously diagnosed, if not already treated properly with medicine (referring to actual medical cauterization) – be it for ulcers on the forehead often associated as pain lines of long duration indicating illness severity - apply heat so intensely that you incinerate these wounds; afterwards rest your hand briefly within its confines, using a bow drill tool. This description alludes to an old medical practice where severe headaches or pains (possibly migragets) associated with skin ulcers are treated through cauterization – the deliberate burning of affected areas in hopes of sealing wounds and halting bleeding by destroying tissue, thereby stopping pain.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of the grinding jaw (which becomes crooked during chewing), so that the lock does not become hardened and damage the nerve associated with this movement, in order to prevent spasm from occurr extruding.

"Treatment that is healed and related to caustication not involves spices brought in by veins; as we have explained in the divisions of diseases."

When you treat that species of torture involving jerks and purges, without comforting the illness itself during caustication; be wary because three cauterizations are involved: the gold thorn (implying a specific tool or substance), then small doses from your temple amulet/talismans, lastly lips sealed together by pressing." Here we have an explanation of various components necessary when conducting causticization for certain illness symptoms—a reference to using three distinct methods: possibly involving precious metals like gold (symbolized here as 'gold thorn'), amulets or talismans from the healer's possession ('small doses from your temple talisman') and a third unspecified method indicated by "the lips sealed together." The context implies these are remedies within an esoteric, possibly medieval framework of medicine where specific objects carry particular medicinal properties.

When ancient tears in the eyes are particularly inflamed and evident through veins and arteries where they appear prominently at the forehead or head surface – indicating an excess of fluid leaking from eye fluids, as previously noted (referenced earlier) - one should cauterize that which was mentioned beforehand concerning water drainage in eyes. This includes performing a cautery on both sides where tears are present: two at the temple area between temples and nose – often referred to as 'cervitz' or cheekbone region, employing dual points of intervention; one within each space adjacent (between) these areas using precise instruments possibly crafted from bone. If ingestions of excess are present, then burn that in all parts of the belly over the small intestine with a tiny cauterization instrument.

Cautery of the mouth ulceration, indicating an intervention for treating such lesions possibly with heat-based methods as described in historical medical practice
When the tongue or palate is affected by apastema and corruption, which are considered outdated conditions leading to ulceration in those areas (presumably of the mouth), proper care must be taken for that healing should occur without further neglecting its treatment; apply as much cautery therein required within the lesion where it’s most needed. Introduce your flame-based instrument into the cavity of said ulcer, ensuring contact with all affected areas (the base and sides), so heat can effectively reach the wound bed – this should be done once or twice; afterwards take care to maintain warmth at that spot until healing sets in. Hereby adhering strictly to these instructions will ensure proper curative measures are undertaken for effective treatment of mouth ulcers, following traditional cauterization practices as previously mentioned by the author(s).
Therefore, if the illness has been removed and health restored, be contented with it; but if not, then you must find out where it is lodged and hold back its rotting bone according to what comes forth in its cavity.

Further, instruments are applied to different regions: one each on the stomach again (indicating multiple sessions may be involved), two positioned in between the lumbar vertebrae suggesting a localized treatment for back issues ("entre les spondils"), and another possibly aiming at an area within or related to digestion, given that 'melsa' refers broadly here. The usage of cautery ('cauterizes') on these specific body parts indicates targeted therapeutic interventions in ancient medical practice, likely intended for both diagnostic and treatment purposes regarding various organ systems including the spinal region ("spondils") and digestive tracts ("stomach," "intestines"). The detailed account of cauterization sites suggests a complex understanding by these historical practitioners The quantity of depth for the cautery is determined by the length of the catheter.

It indicates the perceived relationship between moisture infiltration and dampness, potentially leading to inflammation of joints. When the location of the dislocation is in painful places (quays bóit), it means that a joint or limb has become misaligned and needs attention to be corrected back into its proper position

And only use this specific tool for the purpose of draining out excess fluid, which is causing pain.
Therefore, apply drainage from the malady through plugged and seemingly pains in three lines according to their position, placing a pin on any one line with cautery as much as they tolerate based on the condition of the malady and its humors.
And it is also meant for cauterization with points of a pointed instrument.
If you wish, apply three or four cautery nails in this manner:

When joint pain is caused by cold or thick humors that infiltrate each part of the body; when such pains occur in the feet—it's a common practice among healers to suggest cauterization accordingly: "Joint aches resulting from circulatory impairments, affecting every segment of our bodies leading especially to foot pain. Thus it is standard medical procedure for practitioners herein referenced." This guidance highlights an early understanding in medieval medicine that the flow and balance (humors) within one's body are crucial to health, with specific remedies aimed at restoring
So when gout is healed by the medicinal treatment and there are no longer any pains left, then apply caulcations to remove the remaining pain.
When you burn away that particular effluvion in the circulatory joint of the foot and thigh, with your caustics.
That is the form of this pointed instrument used as a caustic (cauterizing tool):
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for this purpose. If the pains penetrate into the abdomen or other joints and motions occur, then it is necessary to apply cautery on each painful spot with three or four pieces of this same cauterium throughout the entire body affected by these movements.
If there are need for caulters that these must be to your needs, then you shall apply the one necessary and not press too hard with your hand on the instruments beforehand; do so only by sending out from between the thighs (the area where cauterization will occur).
If pain penetrates into both legs, then administer the treatment we have discussed in this chapter.
If the pain is only in the limbs and it's called sourness, then a point will be made along the circuits of the bile merry-go-round; points will be placed on these two lines.
If there are residual pains in the joints, then a point is made on the circumference of each nodule over any knob and around the navel area.
If joint or muscle pain comes up during the days of constriction (which could refer to specific times when symptoms are exacerbated), then they will perform cautery on all parts aiding them in relief and treatment.
If there is not a good discharge of the melancholy from its proper place and if even with a beneficial diet and medicine it remains present in this manner due to lack of outflow through treatment (which includes cautery), God helps.

From your phrase, it seems like you're referring to the concept of cauterizing wounds in Latin-
When there is an opening in the joints and fingers, with cauterizing tools near the belly of a patient who commands their humors to be released into themselves for they want this action as relieving causes so that the fissure may not extend from within them anymore.
Return the malady between your thighs over their two joints and command that it enters into those spaces, where an atel or hernia may appear as a fistula (opening).

And place the cautery on that body part as directed by you, and keep your hand there until after using said instrument for continuation into the patient'thy pelvis; repeat this action if in the first attempt entry has not been achieved within those of thy limb.
Observe the fire of the intestine at the time of your cautery, to ensure that through it not comes out into the groin area or another serious harmony.
When you understand that when using the cautery, you do not hold onto your hand (or touch it), thereby failing in completing your operation.
And when it is necessary for children with a sharp point of caution (cauterization), be subtle according to the great and proper measure of them.
Return care for the area of the cautery within three days while inflammation subsides in the focus area.
Return care for it so that those other ointments may enter while being healed.
And if it is necessary for the swelling of the belly (the abdomen) to be placed over its two sides for forty days until the location and patient are sealed, then so done as directed by medical authorities.

Cauterization sometimes requires a great amount of force, and little if the species (or type) of leprosy is caused by decay or melancholy as described in medieval texts on medicine:
And when you intend to cauterize that one, consider if the leprosy is mixed and has been treated with the water we have spoken about in division, neither of these nor this will affect the whole body or its complexity; then cauterize it on the head under which there are a few drops (of medicinal substance), at the second toe after touching down here below, between hair and skin; both over two corns; one behind, upon necklace/strap:
Here comes the last part of your procedure where you introduce a small incision with the cautery, moving it until the scrapings are displaced, allowing thick vapors to escape from within; and then perform cauterization on the wound as previously directed.
If leprosy has spread over the thigh and now shows symptoms, then cover that with some of these cauterums which we have in our head; apply them to the extremity of the nose, two on each kneecap, two upon two vertebrae of the backbone, a large one for those vertebrae near the coil, and another over the ribcage. Place others on joints/knees, muscles, their own fingers; cauterize that area covering all joint connections in the limbs and feet, as well as each heel of your foot where pain occurs (likely referring to gout).
Guard your nerves that are above the ankle so they do not burn those.
Some procedures involve burning a pointed cautery on the patient'dict kneecap and mouth area as well as their genitals.
Be aware that the more you adjust the cautery, the more it will heal and provide relief; also be aware that there is no pain from the malady in those places where they have their hands on them, so much so that your body becomes astonished at these interventions.
When it is necessary for the cautery (used as treatment) to be large or small according to the members and joints preceding what was provided by the tools of medicine,

When suffering comes from consuming excessive wine or spirits; at that point, it is necessary to perform a circular incision in the course of consumption as they agitate and cause disruption—akin to causing internal turmonel circulation disturbances when consumed. This suggests an early understanding of intoxication effects on bodily functions possibly leading to self-inflicted harm through excessive drinking, which was recognized by medieval practitioners who might have
They observed that the affected area has been previously cauterized at this location (implying healing of an old wound or lesion); it is possible I have not seen him before because there may be ulceration present, and yes indeed they were already providing care on occasion. This implies a continuity in treatment for recurring conditions like chronic skin issues possibly due to lifestyle factors such as heavy drinking mentioned earlier—an acknowledgment of the need for repeated medical intervention which speaks volumes about their long-term patient management strategies during medieval times.

When any ulceration is delayed in healing, and it occurs due to excessive phlegm (fayza), poor constitution of the humor within ("sanc"), time pressures or other factors – you wish to hasten its final stage; herein we apply cauterization at small puncture points throughout the body's channels where minor burn treatments have been previously applied. In these cases, after applying such treatment (cauterizing), ensure that they thirst for healing so as not to disrupt their restoration process ("maturacio").
If you wish to perform the procedure of this (the incision), then heat it with fire, and leave that instrument in the place where nourishment enters through the cleft: so that parturition occurs therein.

In this line, it appears you are referring to a treatment method involving some form of application meant for relieving pain caused
The translation suggests that the 'corrodent' is an active substance or agent within the body of the affected member (likely referring to some form of internal irritant), which metaphorically acts like dry, gnawing wood caught in one's mouth – indicating a severe and possibly relentless discomfort. The term 'cauterizes', used
This implies that if the irritant within a certain location (perhaps in this context referring to an actual physical spot where discomfort is experienced) needs cauterization, one would lightly ignite small splinters of wood and apply them directly there for as long as necessary. This approach suggests using minimal heat applied precisely at the site affected by 'corrodent' (the irritant), to neutralize or alleviate its effects through targeted application – a method that likely dates back to practices before modern medicine, possibly involving less sophisticated forms of treatment for internal issues compared with today
The final statement indicates that such direct application is aimed at completely eliminating the entirety of 'corrodent' within a specified area, thereby preventing any further cause or source from exacerbating it – implying an intent to thoroughly treat and resolve whatever discomfort has been described in these lines. It reflects principles consistent with medieval medical practices where direct action
Here the practitioner is directing that this treatment be conducted over three days, with intermittent periods of rest wherein oil mixed within a specific timeframe (three-day period) would ensure scars are entirely healed and complete resolution from 'corruption' or decay. This methodical approach to cauterization reflects an understanding – in the context provided by these lines written centuries ago – that certain treatments require diligent, sustained effort for effective results, a concept still relevant today even as modern medicine has largely supplanted such practices with alternative techniques and technology-

Before doing so, make sure to moisten that part first using the remaining distilled water in the flask and wrap this around yourself tightly, rotating continuously until you reach saturation – ensuring no gap between body wraps for absorbing as much fluid as possible; then apply pressure back into the catheter once its purpose is served. The patient should wait a few hours after each puncture from that sharp tool before reapplying such treatment, provided their veins have already been drawn open by your actions (i.e., bloodletting).

Therefore, when you cauterize with boiling water (often a traditional method), place the intestine back into its cavity by using hot irons or similar tools; doing so will stop bleeding within that area where guards have been maintained and ensure it does not burst further.

When ancient acids or cataracts arise due to moisture and quality in the temple areas (the regions of the head where skull sutures meet near the eyes), doctors employ medicinal maneuvers for treatment, which alleviates these ailments; herein we find ourselves dealing with such illnesses that necessitate extraction from within the temples or cauterization thereof.

When the humors are sharp and acidic within those veins located beneath the head's crown (which is considered to be under a "headcup"), no external cause hinders their medical treatment; at times even the patient’s face burns, feels as if ambulating like ants in its own movement, making it exacerbated.

And when blood flows in the earlobe or appears to resemble those causes that do not fit into it, and if you see such flow, this may be due to some disruption of oil or bile secretion, apply treatment for its extraction, and make them sweat as a condition. Return the pause in the circulation of the artery some rags or wool and extend the artery towards the parts above it continuously to address these causes.
If there has not been a release (from the blockage), then apply gentle manipulation using small instruments of which this is the form.

The practitioner is suggesting a method to 'cleanse' the breath within oneself by purifying it (possibly referring to taking in fresh air) and then, through exhalation or blowing into them—perhaps as part of an examination process with these meats—puffs out air from their small openings.

When on the surface of our divided and incisor teeth, as well as between the gums, there are sharp points or white/yellow streaks; these lines are citrine (possibly referring to a yellowish appearance) indicative signs that decay has set into action within. Such findings suggest urgent dental attention is required—decayed and potentially sensitive teeth needing immediate care.

Where you cure the tooth of his pain at once throughout its entire extraction process, there is no reason why it would interrupt their diet when it'thy removal; for what purifies within that substance which serves as a substitute during the excision." This line discusses post-extraction care and suggests that any medication used in this context should not interfile with eating habits afterward. It implies confidence that whatever is being taken (likely some form of anesthetic or analgesic) will naturally be absorbed by the body during tooth extraction, thus eliminating concerns about dietary restrictions following dental surgery in this context.
Where the humors are unbalanced and caused this painful tooth removal; you must certify which is indeed the source of discomfort: what causes dyspepsia in that troublesome, diseased tooth—once identified, we can treat it accordingly. Nowhere have I seen such effective operation by barbers." Here, a medieval practitioner appears concerned about their understanding and treatment ability for dental issues beyond simple extraction (which may historically fall under the purview of barber-surgeons). They're calling out to another professional—perhaps someone with specialized knowledge in treating such conditions without surgery. It suggests that they recognize certain oral ailments could require intervention by those specifically trained, rather than just removing an offending molar due to imbalanced humors (a medieval concept of bodily fluids causing disease). This line touches on the complexity and potential need for specialized care in dentistry during this period.
So when you need to confirm what the painful tooth is and how bad it hurts, then make an incision in the circuit of the affected tooth where there may be any movement, enter until the dental pulp from all sides has been dissolved, and apply cold or fine forceps gradually within that cavity as long as you are removing what remains.

When treating teeth, care must be taken for other parts as well. (This translation takes into account the medieval medical context where treatments were often holistic
When teeth protrude naturally in the legs and especially breasts (which is common), it's crucial to consider: if one tooth isn’t related or connected with another, removal or separation of them may not be feasible; however, should there indeed be a connection between two upper molars as part of an ensemble – similarly like pigs in the mud – then this procedure is performed using India steel scraped from outside.
And your finger is where you insert it for that period of days to alleviate the hardness of teeth and not make them worse than they already are.
If there is an excessive opening of the mouth (perhaps referring to some kind of oral condition), then touch that area with the Indian steel from which this tool is made.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And whether it is entirely of iron from India and brought here by ship; or stone points obtained locally with a sharp blade made of flint (the kind used for surgical incisions), they are sharpened quickly, so that there won't be any other uncut teeth left. When lines are drawn above in time, they draw attention with urgency.
If there is one part that has been torn and the tongue protrudes due to its sharpness caused by this fracture, then take care that you clip what' extruded within it where the acuteness of the fragmentation causes discomfort or speaks eloquently. Make sure the tongue does not further extend out nor damage speech.

If it is not known what causes these things have been said about them, then use a lead tool in this form.
And if it is a large one that enters within you (referring possibly to an obstruction or foreign body), then insert it into its cavity, which allows for easy expulsion from the throat.
And lift the patient'thy head upwards and ensure that their mouth care is taken to prevent them from entering into (or experiencing) pain in their throat or backbone, which is what their doctor has for them.
Mayhaps the swelling that enters therein due to its science of the location and cause associated has been called in place by now; take hold of your tool as prepared, according to how much is needed within that opening provided.

When the bloodletting fluid is used for treatment in medicine and it shouldn't be consumed directly (as per medical guidelines), consider that you need to place this liquid into the cupping tool of your choice, which we have previously recommended or provided for use. Here are some potential translations:
So if you touch the swelling again, extract that little or subtle movement gently.
If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave canula and insert that into the buttocks of the patient, placing a heated iron at the bottom of the canula's curve, and apply as many drops (while ensuring that the suppository has died and remains within the rectum) to prevent the humors from flowing for the entire day.

If there is no hole for inhalation of water (a technique used by the healer), then exhale moisture into the throat using the same tool utilized during steam inhalation, thereby humidifying and cleansing it to aid recovery.

And it's another method of operation in the smoking process, where you take on an oily substance that is covered by a blanket within which there’sfound to be cracks; and place your hand underneath this covering—above which sits the lancet (instrument), with its tip at the extremity touching the underside. At the same time, you pull down below where the smoking occurs so that sublimation does not happen within what you understand to be already reached by said smoke; and pause the malady's mouth on the jaw end of the canula (instrument), securing it with your bite until such a moment when this part of the operation, wherein we apply heat through smoking for therapeutic purposes—has arrived at its targeted area within our body.
If not controlled, then repeat the subfumigation movements, and prevent the malady from drinking, eat salted and acidic foods, do not partake in wine consumption, if necessary it is that this regimen must be followed.
This is the form of the tool with which you take out (extract) when seen. It resembles forceps used sometimes, but there's no curve in it. the tablet where it resembles the beak of a cormorant (guinea fowl), which is moistened with lime for four days, until any cause arises that does not allow this to happen anymore.

When some of those which are not pierced but have reached the stage of illness in these or their complements come, take them with caution for they may be diseased signs within you.
So other instruments that are dislocated when crossed and do not mature according to their kind, similar to those at joints, which become a cause of contraction in that part; or an instrument belonging to the main member, then if you delay its perforation until it ripens within the primary member itself; or related to the navel (belly button), and pierce it before maturity – this will not induce indigestion but rather affects only what is projected from that area of the belly, elongating the segments thereof, resulting in a fistula, or pain localized within itself which cannot be healed. May you know the time of the puncture for the abscess and so it is when it ripens.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When you understand that it matures when there is cessation of pain and fever, then reduce swelling and heart rate, strengthen the head of the abscess, and other symptoms as well.
When you know that there is a healing incision in the location where drainage and discharge from treatment of elevation have occurred recently,
When puncturing is necessary for the length of the flesh or body part, if it occurs in the parts of the mass or feet, and at locations where nerves are present as well as arteries; then use piercing according to that particular area which reflects light upon examination. In those places where reflection cannot be seen, apply puncturing everywhere there is a complex structure.
When the abscess is in the fleshly part of the body, we must insert a catheter into it until the digestion inside him/herself has been confirmed fully; but if you perforate that area now, then the thigh's hernia and its moist (or wet) abdomen will be extended, causing hardening of their lips and increasing depth.
May an apothecary make holes according to the size of the body or as needed by which part desires it (i.dict).
When you administer a small puncture, and in the case of large or broad piercings according to the variety of the size of these apasts (large perforations), proceed as follows:
Other things come where the coccyx is broken and inflamed, when bread dipped in wine causes pain that has already begun to seep into those areas, similar to what you feel with beans or bladders full of pus (probably referring to abscesses).
From those who are seated and have three angles; they sit similarly to the form of a miter wood or as with the pins of an arrowheads.
From them in which it is administered, a round and moon-like pillion, resembling those ones (the medication).
May that person who cannot be pierced with their surface appendages not come to you for an incision or a flat puncture only so superfloingly.
When the ulcer is large and has collected disease matter, do not extract all of it at once; take out one portion from that area today, restore the ulcer within another day with a larger extraction piece, and remove additional layers as dictated by progression to ensure complete drainage.
Mostly if the malady is caused by hot bile or old age, or in pregnancy and infants who are weakened, for their spirits move to exit during illness, which results in death of the malady; at that time you perform treatment on them.
Guard your actions with great care and place your incision where you pierce these thorns, making sure to avoid infections; consider if the wound'dict is healing or flatulent—administer such treatments as prescribed by ancient remedies or contemporary physicians. If the thorn wound is large, and there are fissures within your incision site, cease operations at any disruption point where we might encounter them together during treatment.
If in the abscess there has been detachment of a part of the colon or if that area has become concave within its circuit, then you must compress it tightly with woolen cloths as soon as possible when carrying pans and other household items, increasing humidity; and apply heat to hasten healing for the fluid accumulated inside due to bandaging.
If you experience bleeding during your operation, then administer cold water and apply pressure with these cloths where the blood flow is directed towards it; pause there to control the bleeding from the wound'dictating its movement of fluids in that moment.
If the flow of blood continues, then ensure that you follow your diet and care regimen with these recommended powders in places mentioned herein within this text for division/separation.
If it is winter time and the ulceration location is where nerves are located, then cover them with crumbs of hemp or oil using caution needlework, and pause these over the locations to protect the nerves.
If it is summer and the locations are meaty, then when you pause pulpils at the beginning in water and oil as we have discussed, do so until the dry day arrives according to what has been said before; also make sure that you cut out the abscess and cleanse away any pus therein, for this is part of the treatment process.

The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
When appendicitis occurs in the area of the navel, it refers to inflammation or swelling related to the appendix located near or around the belly button (navel
When appendicitis affects the navel area, it is due to worm-like parasites contained within their bodies; these are what drive them (the causes of inflammation). The phrase suggests that internal organisms such as intestinal parasites could be responsible for causing or exacerbating an appendicitis attack in the navel region. These unseen elements inside ("nodes") have protective coats ('tunicas'),
They are slimy or slippery (descriptors of parasite texture), and they contain moisture like lemon juice ('humidity'). The description likely refers to the presence of worms with mucus-like excretions that These contain moisture like pressure points ('polst'), and they assemble together (possibly referring to different types of parasites found in the area). Additionally, there are hard ones among them that resist being squeezed or manipulated easily ("dur"). This line further characterizes the worms present at a possible site of appendicitis inflammation as having moist bodies with points similar to pressure spots on human skin
In the entire section and during their extraction, there is not to be feared; when extracting them (presumably worms), it does not contravene or violate one's chastity ('arceria'). This suggests that in some historical medical context, removing parasitic entities such as intestinal worms might have been a procedure associated with purification and could potentially be related

Therefore in the position of good disposition during treatment, the color that is manifested belongs to the color of the navel and it affects the entire body without being attached to nerves or veins nor arteries; not prone as when you insert something into this superfthy part between the upper thigh line (belly button) .B. and lower chest line .G., observe that portion in its whole, and extract it with one snip from above downward to below if necessary, similar to how we have mentioned earlier at the base of our teeth/gums.
It is possible that a vein or nerve may not be inserted.
Even if the spine does not cause gout, adjust your hand inside oneself skillfully or disturb the humors, and do not necessarily inscribe; should you decide to incise vein or artery and prohibit from doing so in your operation, pause here on this dirty glassware scattered with dust particles that flow out of sanctioned sources. Then rest while healing occurs within the state of applied treatment and softens the wound area thus preparing it for further intervention (or "healing"). When the sanction has detached.
Then return to your operation within which you have completed it.
Once you've investigated if there is any cause of the other small lumps present here, inquire about them and cleanse those areas accordingly.
If it is in the lumbago of great veins, then do not insert that scrofulous thing into its cavity. Based on my understanding of Latin-influenced languages and medieval medical terminology, here is the line by line translation:
Return and complete the work of sealing small wounds that you have already covered with Egyptian ointment, and provide care for it as well.
If you find that entire swelling (scrofulum), then make sure to adjust the patient's lips and cheeks just enough so that not a single excess is left.
May you find yourself in a situation where there has been an excessive overflow due to the greatness of the swelling (scrofulus), and understand that explanation for this, as well as administering stitches according to what is stated.
When the scrofulous that contain moisture penetrate here to your place of maturation and a puncture through which it enters occurs above this location below what you have placed there for them, just as we have said before.
And apply medicine through puncture with warm ointment and liniments to those areas so that the dissolved part of what was formed by decay can be removed from the body'se core. When you are about to empty the patient's bowels (presumably referring to purging or a cleansing process), then take care of that body fat which is inside, so it can be healed.

And this ailment is believed to be either twofold or inherent and incidental (natural) in nature - suggesting that its causes might include genetic predisposition as well as
Moreover, when it comes from a natural cause there is little hope for cure – implying the chronic and often progress
Additionally, the accidental cause is also twofold: it seems like a cluster of nodes (perhaps referring to lymph glands or possibly small nodules) and another appears as an outward manifestation where blood vessels are involved – both situations bring about fear due to their nature. Here 'nodacio de arteria' could mean issues related with the vascified parts, likely suggesting varicose veins (the misunderstanding may stem from a mix-up of medical terminology).

Concerning the care of the navel." Translation into English: The focus is on how best to take care
The navel is pained by causes or because of fissures in the belly button (umbilicus), and it's treated with a thread or bandage according to what happens during other ruptures; or for varicose veins, which flow as described herein." Translation into English: The navel may be experiencing pain due to various reasons such as fissures in the belly button. Treatment involves using thread (or suturing) following methods suitable for repairing ruptures elsewhere on the body or addressing varicose veins, which are detailed further within this text according to their specific flow patterns when subjected to constriction similar to that of a tourniquet applied at different locations.
If there is a crack in the chest and tears in the fabric of life (the body), then the color of the ulceration resembles that of the flesh; it hurts like a lion from various situations. If it is an exodus of the intestine, then with what we have recorded before about that which has come out today there may be a strong difference in intensity; and when you perceive this, return to its place; as soon as done so, wash him down with baths and apply vigorous rubbing.
If due to moisture, it becomes a lion and is not concealed when you press with your hand on the area, nor does it tighten or swell up.
If it is for sanitation, then soon you will see ulcers appearing from black decay descending upon these limbs.
May it be due to meat nothing grave, hard and long lasting; then it is placed according to a certain quantity.
May it be due to wind movement, then touching (it) is like a lion.
And when performing the operation on him is to consider whether the navel' extrusion (protrusion) is due to a stone, or vein, or swelling; if so, forbid what you have learned from your teacher in this very place where I taught these methods of cauterization for stones and varices.
If the prominency of the navel is due to the intestine or fabric, then command that which holds it, and have it extended; also give orders throughout the whole belly area around the point where you touched for handling, positioning over their hands above them in this space. Also encompass within its circuit the spasm of bone pain all around the navel's location here as well—place that which can hold or yield there too (possibly a ligature), and also take into account how far down it extends when handling; apply pressure to where you touched for relief, surrounding with forceps if necessary.
Here is the translation of each line:
If you have torn the fabric (likely referring metaphorically here), then take that one out; and cut away any excess parts of it.
May it be contrary to your artery or vein, around that area you must go back and perform the operation again; take two needles and insert them into those strong fields where you have pierced through the abscess in its entirety, which causes penetration—insert the abscess between these four parts on top of the needles.
If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them into where it pierces the extended flesh, inscribe that part when subtlety enters and is inserted there; additionally provide care for that area which has been treated with wax from within these implements as they heal.
If the navel's prominence is of flesh or due to moisture, then cover it with what has been used and removed for dampness from there, which you apply in that place, taking care also of whatever covers and consolidates it there.

And only the iron itself is healing for it alone and not close to either the bells of tympanists or to the spice of hypochondria, as this poison (the humors) brings death.
When you have already treated this herbal tympanic medicine and it does not cause discomfort to your medication, consider that if the malady in the abdomen has been alleviated or other ailments therein are addressed for these reasons as well; however, be wary of applying iron remedies here, fear is upon you.
If you again find the patient's waist overflowing with vitality and not suffering from any other illnesses or babies in tow, then this is merely excessive energy for which their intervention means lifting up the belly between your own legs, applying pressure on the abdomen as per its position near the pubis area.

In this line, the text describes a medical condition related to pain in the groin and at the base of the penis caused by inflammation (corruption) or foreign material accumulation leading to sticking together ("adherence") of parts within the inguinal region. Translating it into modern English:
Movements worsen this pain in the groin and it is evident of fatty flesh.
From that one it is harmful (evil or morbid), and from others not so;
No harmful act of suspending under the delicate and withdrawing that which is within it therein wholely; and place pause upon that spot beneath with Egyptian wax submerged in oil, and apply this dressing whereby healing may occur inside what has been cured.
If it is black (implying something dark or possibly cancerous), and the limb has a darker hue than usual, then apply your cautions to the body'dictum and the region of that person.
If the foreskin is present on the head of the penis, and one part has been cut off while another remains intact (which you are holding), secure it until inside where healing occurs; then continue to care for that incision so when caring for the circumcision itself, there's no risk it may start bleeding again.

If the head of the gallbladthy is corroded and destroyed at once, it's time to insert a bronze catheter into the abdomen chest through which bile will flow.
In the attachment of the prepuce at the base of the foreskin (and this adherence is not excised from where it'se attached, nor does circumcision pressure upon it; and when you encounter adhesion due to dirt or scab) cover that hardened area within which the skin has contracted.

The provided text appears to be an excerpt from medieval medical literature discussing treatment methods
In the process of raising children and caring for those who have undergone circumcision.
Circumcision is not a solution for continuity with other diseases: however, if it comes from our operation and of our will, and in children, we must assign them to the better healing way using milder methods.
So it is said that ancient ones did not perform circumcision around the times of liberty, nor do they use them in their laws, and only have them for experimentation purposes. This reason leads to many artisans and barbarians abandoning circumcision and mundification (the process involving a new scalpel and forceps), instead using sinew from an animal'thy leg and skinning of the nail; these materials are used as ligature and knife, respectively.
E you have already employed all these methods and found no better improvement than with the knife or thread that in embroidery (a skill related to needlework), some threads flee from below the waist, others down between the two tunics of the foreskin, and they tighten when pressed quickly. E arises the cleansing that causes pain for alphecates and digits (fingers/toes), using gloves, which is not securely contained within the member' extrinsic part; it fearfully enters into its track (possibly referring to a joint or cavity where fingers/toes meet).
In surgery with an unsheathed blade, it will cause you trouble and ruin your operation. The beard of the child is naturally short and tends to itch in this manner without needing to trim, which has been observed by him (the doctor).
May the mending that I do with thread and needle for health has taught me wisdom (or perhaps this should be understood as "I have learned through my practice of healing"). For when threads are proportionate to size, just like how sharpness is relative to usage; therefore, once you measure two points of tension on your body, apply it according to a ratio and do so quickly in time. This results in the shape formed by tightening the thread around all parts (likely referring to bandaging or compression) without error throughout its entirety.
The first sentence translates to: The primary task of the initial operation is that you make sure the patient is mostly lying on their back in the bedchair for only as long as necessary and then let them out today.
And make that joy throughout all of their mind, which is what you can possibly receive from them through your intelligence. Here the patient is prepared to rest between your own limbs without discomfort, and hide the tools in either of your arms or chest so that the child does not see those nor any other instrument.
Here comes the translation:
The shape of the forceps is this way, it represents how they should be shaped and used.
These are the bones outside and others inside that don'thy not go as far upwards to where clas has its length; their lengths match those of two handles grasped by hands together.
May errors in understanding occur frequently and can easily escape the internal core of knowledge; it requires insight (understanding).
So that you spread it on your finger nail now, and insert this secondly equally into the affected area during adhesion.
If you cannot hold it with your finger, then extract that amount from one unit and incise that portion.
If it has been three days, and the poultice that is applied to the inflamed node compresses downward due to pressure from above, then apply water as soon as possible into which the abscess has softened (and exuded its fluid), and afterwards rinse with what you have prepared for this purpose.
Guard your head of virtue does not allow water for us.
Therefore take care of that water which the dirt has solidified in the passage of the dusts.

When acute inflammation or abscess occurs in the bladder (vesica), or a stone forms within it ('sanctum congelatum'), and there is an obstruction of urine flow possibly due to this blockage, you are tasked with drawing water and medicines into that location using the appropriate instrument – likely referring herein as 'clampcuda'. This act represents treatment:
sino que in the exterior of it is silent, then it is closed. And in that way, three troubles arise from one division: they occur twice as often.
In the meal it is calm, wherein healing occurs and its second quantity that climbs above draws away from there when any cause drags it downwards; likewise, when drawn out again, or expelled for a long time, so much of naphtha flows into the battles at sea.

We have already divided the stones and cured them with medicine; here we discuss the differences between those formed in urine (vesical calculi) and those from reabsorption/secretion processes within our bodies that form stone-like structures, as well as their characteristics ("senhals"). This passage reflects an understanding of urolithiasis—the formation of stones or "peyra" inside the body. It distinguishes between types based on origin (urine versus other bodily fluids) and likely elaborates further into how each type forms, its composition, potential symptoms it may cause ("senhals"), as well as

Thus it is said that stones originating in the bladder mostly occur in children; and about those signs of illness which when they are excreted from the urine, appear as though water in its subtlety flows therein—implying a crystal-like or small particle presence within. Here, "malaute" (uric acid) froths on the ureter's surface ("vergua"), and tiny movements of those particles descend like drops; they come forth into forceful streams when urination occurs at that moment in time—referring to kidney stones passing during a voiding spell. This passage discusses pediatric nephrolithiasis (kidney stone formation), the symptoms associated with it, particularly how pain and spasms are felt as crystalline particles pass through urinary tracts ("malaute fregua la sua vergua"), highlighting a clinical picture of acute renal colic during which kidney stones (kidney stone formation) may present. It conveys how the symptoms, often

For when you cannot insert the tool used for bowel movements into that position in the anus (the natural place), then resort to progression of this act outside its usual location as needed, but do not exceed it with force if necessary due to resistance from within therein.
And know that there is any stone from which the limb bends and corners (the joints), thus treatment of it will be difficult due to its water content.

From this fragment, "Cura de hernia entestinal," we can deduce that the topic is likely
The provided Latin-influenced sentence translates into English as: "This hernia event comes about because of the extension over the belly surface by intestinal bands, and when these bowel loops protrude through their openings." This passage describes how a hernia develops due to certain internal structures (possibly referring to peritoneal folds or ligaments associated with abdominal anatomy) that expand beyond the belly area. When this happens, portions of these intestinal bands protrude through their natural openings into what would otherwise be a normally closed space within the
In this continuation of the medical explanation regarding hernias in English reads as follows: "This rupture is either from the cushion or due to a fistula; these conditions are brought about by various causes such as pressing upon, rubbing against (friction), loud noise affecting internal structures like air bubbles during surgery causing them to be dislodged and potentially protruded through an opening in the body." Here we see how different actions or events—like physical pressure, friction from movement, sounds that may vibrate organs inside (possibly referring to intraoperative scenarios), significant external force applied by something like a surgical tool ("clamor"),
Translating the text into English gives us: "When there is extenuation of the cushion (which could be referring to a pressure ulcer or other type of localized tissue damage), it worsens progressively over time without significant improvement, and within this period, urine enters longingly through these openings in exchange for where the protruded bowel loops are situated relative to the peritoneum." The text here describes a complication that occurs when there is persistent tissue damage such as an ulcer or pressure sore ("senhal de aquo") associated with extended periods of strain (extruition) on certain body parts.
When the patient'thy body is in one of its sections according to Cancer (the zodiac sign), suddenly strong pain occurs; various apparent symptoms appear on the protected area near the navel, and it is due to the intestine being expelled within them, affecting all parts down from there.

This sentence discusses the reasons for hair growth and suggests that some women, particularly within certain circumstances—potentially those related to menstruation or sexual activity (coitus), as indicated by "entred le reguardament" meaning under medical supervision ("the attention of doctors") which could imply a study of natural processes.

This line translates to English as: "Or it may be from the womb of a woman or in her joints and flesh undernethy (underbelly), or on top of its purse (breast) due to excess humidity, expulsion, conception processes, fertilization. All these things are forbidden." Here we can discern that medieval medical practitioners were concerned with the potential causes within a woman's body and their implications for health according to prevailing theories of medicine at the time—highlighting issues such as fluid retention (humidity), pregnancy processes, which they believed should be avoided or prohibited. The sentence captures an aspect where physicians attempted to control what
The English translation of this line is: "And as for the understanding (cognition) of such things being considered by reason or observation—if it appears visibly present in a young person, then instruct accordingly; otherwise, seek out that individual at dawn or dusk."

Based on the mix of languages and archaic medical terminology present in this medieval treatise snippet, here's a line by line translation into English:
If the child'thy efforts to maintain themselves are difficult and they come upon us with aspects that do not align naturally as described by them, then take care of these deficiencies just like we have recounted.
If the midwife is subtle and gentle with her touch that makes things easier and more delicate, as well as timely in action according to how she has prepared herself for healing intervention, then this will contribute entirely to restoring health overall.
Remembrance of what formed within the womb and abortions occurred.
Some pregnancies are formed in the month of one, and two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or nine months; I must verify whether a woman has had only one abortion, or more than nine formations, which causes pain as measured by the wise.

If it does not become complicated and you do not want medication, then proceed with the treatment as quickly as your ability allows.
If there is an opening in the abdomen or it's inside and downwardly directed (perhaps referring to a dysentery with downward symptoms), then you must perforate that which contains the moisture within.
If it is about your feet, then the action of yours (the healer/doctor) will be gentle and directed towards the mouth of the patient (gentle).
If the belly and chest are compressed and constricted (by whatever means), then take away that dress which covers your body, cutting it where necessary until fluid flows in those areas where they have become swolthy or distended.
If other members are also numb and return the head; if the mouth of the mother is blocked, insert it into the lower part of her body, secure that area with a lock around their heads, draw them in here using one or two pins/locks, and fix these to those areas.
If the mother'thy mouth is closed by apatema that causes pain in the throat, then do not cover it there further; above this place administer treatment for watery and fatty effusions. Embrace liniments; continue attending the patient in waters that moisturize and soften.
If the flesh is on the chest, it is better if possible to lance (with a lancet), and such treatment should be administered as mentioned for the living body.

From removal of the second one (assuming this refers to a procedure or part that has been previously mentioned in context).
When the second one is retained by it (possibly referring to an organ or substance within a patient), then you must command the malady that holds its secretion, and perform such purifying technique; hold your hand firmly over their mouth and nipples ('nurses' may be colloquial for breasts in this context). If by doing so it results in expulsion (as if inducing labor or a similar action), then you have done well.
If not, then take a wave and pierce through the covering at that spot where burning herb (likely poultice) cools down the mother'se mouth, with calamint and rue and chamomile and clove oil/powder; administer as needed.

Of caring for ulcers that arise occasionally.
The leaking passages in the lower region and belly space, from which they arise naturally or as a consequence of being outside for too long:
This line translates as follows into English: "It is a fistula or abscess.
This translates to English as: "When that obstruction is ancient and allows the escape of moist, sticky vapors or effluvia, and some wandering ulcers come from these fistulas."
Those penetrating things that they fear because of the exit and expulsion issues are used by some for these problems; others resort to those means (likely medicinal herbs or remedies) due to their presence thereof.
From those fistulas occasionally occurring in the penetrable space within the bladder and entering into the meat of the thigh, and from those that enter into the junction of the hip joint and the navel; these are so directed.
When the fluid (abscess) within a penetrating abscess enters into the belly and does not enter elsewhere, it is that you introduce your thread herein into the abdomen, and insert beneath subtle silk or iron into the fistula when there's no tendernthy.
If in that state of tightness the humors or pus enter under what you feel as pressure below, where there is a subtle clog inside it (the body), and another within your thighs/legs, holding their hands:
If you do not feel that one nor the other for any cause of obstruction or vermes (worms) and windiness, as we have said before, then understand it is non-penetrating, and attend to your cure.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or the prostate, it signifies that he is suffering from his own urine and its excretion should be eliminated so that the location becomes medicine-consolidated (i.dicted).
May it be that something penetrates the juncture of the thigh or enters the bone and causes pain throughout the circuit, then this person is considered to tempt entry into here if they do not have timidity towards entering the bone; one must immediately apply heat treatment for relief, as neither bandaging nor wax consolidation are effective in such medical care.
In all those perforating sores there is not a cure, and the treatment of these by physicians involves toil and weariness concerning what has been firmly established within them.
May heal as hoped for when it'thy (referring to the treatment) is not penetrating and aggressive, according to what you recommend, so long as already given.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the attempt enters and does not penetrate up to where it is in the belly, between that which you hope for flesh or bone (which might be an abscess), then dry out the wound within the fistula on this surface of the navel; once dried, do so with your hand at the site of the fistula and enter through there. Through doing so, they are freed from that which is in them via the tube (the fistula), allowing it to reach where the extremity of the attempt previously was situated.
Return that which purifies those stones clogged, withdrawn through the hollow of the penis needle and without causing any harm from these causes.
May there be instances when the flow of phlegm enters between you and your body's cavity as it ascends those arteries; then take an instrument for cauterization, either at the focus or in acute medicine, which is used to adjust good habits: this allows adjustment of that congested area within vessels, and expulsion of excess phlegm.

So if ten thousand attempts and between you (the doctor) and the patient there is velament of flesh or carn, then it's about permeation, not operation here but rather through trust and hope.
The translated text line by line is as follows: And in some cases the fistula is closed according to this method: when you insert a tack into the fistula, it ends up within the abdomen and on the surface of the cos around the navel and at the edge of the belly button, taking out one end with a surgical needle following this form:
And insert into that covering of flesh or surrounding these fields, and attempt to insert one'dict hand within the foreskin encircling where continuation of his condition is located.
May if it penetrates into the margin of the anus properly inserted therein; then remove its end and adjust both ends, trying each one at a time for up to a day or two, until you can insert the tip back into the flesh where those carnal parts are between the extremities of the intestine.
Return care for what is solidified and healed within you.
If the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, then you must make it so in any way that suits your preparation, except to introduce moisture which would cause an incision; and apply therein whatso extricated shall be healed.
The translation of the medieval medical treatise line by line into English is as follows:
From the seam of hemorrhoids where blood flows within that area.

Indeed, those who have a hole in their buttocks due to scant moisture (as per the weeks of little water), where clear or slightly yellowish urine flows constantly and its color corresponds with that of the body itself.
And for the cure of that which has entered into her colon, it is necessary to command the humors within it so they settle and emerge at the same time in your presence. Now you cut and suspend your knife at the tip of that blade held by your tongue, and press those down onto their faces to remove them from above it (the mouth).
May if the knives are not wet in those places due to their humidity, then take for them either a rough cloth or a heated instrument or waxed linen, and rub these instruments on them until they dry out; apply powder from that point forward as needed when performing cauterization. Or perform the cauterization according to what precedes in the chapter of cauterizing techniques. Return that care for it so ensures its healing within which they have been treated.
If the belly does not obey expulsion, then apply cautery to the affected area with crusts where it is slightly bitten and wash in that water which exists within the colon and which causes obstruction upon evacuation when pressure is applied to the bowel.
If the swellings are in their belly (belly), then that is because of humidity/dampness, and it's your duty to grasp those with your finger or thumb, as well as when they press against you holding them tightly, and afterward apply care for what we have said inside so that these swellings may be healed.
Here's the translation line by line:
When all is done, and only that one not used (the excess fluid) leaves from it, thus the surplus of the sanctus corpus flows away from that which was retained.
And place your hand over the belly, roasted or in a pot; and that same hand upon their colon commands the humors to stop flowing. Return that which is inside the container; and when it becomes dry, heal those within with oil or other medicinal substance contained therein if they are cured (healed).
When they are ancient and not effective in that medicine, then you must create points on the surface of spinal bone (or perhaps "spine" or an appropriate medical term) with sharp instruments within which your hand is kept moistened by those same substances; this prevents them from solidifying. And care for these once they have become consolidated.
When you possess those sharp implements vigorously thrust into the first entrance that moisture comes and they become scalded, ensure these are placed where healing can occur for them to be cured.
You understand that bruising is not serious unless it shows the color of a nail on top of the clavicle (collarbone), and such marks appear throughout the body mainly in the lower parts like legs and feet, therefore you must dress appropriately for these injuries.
Now cover the water that is within its course in the joint and has been lodged or accumulated between the bursae (or cushions/bags) of movement, and remove it from the patient'se body; take care of this matter now.

Care for him involves the use of a catheter or screw-like needle, and it is firmly applied over where contained by the loop within which the canula resides among his body parts; your hand then rotates around that very same canula inside its circuitry in flesh tissue, stopping there to eradify the swelling.
If you wish, use a lead or iron tube according to this manner:
The following is the translation of each line:

And when it is recommended for some diseases in order that the thoughts and rules concerning other illnesses may pause,
When simple diseases are consumed, then the recollection of complex ones will come to the feasting table of the third chest.
So when you have a simple headache that is not due to fracture, consider: if it's from ear stone or appearance, then press and rub the occipital region immediately; don't delay - extract out of there as much as possible according to its quantity. Especially if this swelling on which patient has been suffering comes mainly from a sanctioned node, often only local anesthesia is needed.
When it is time for counter-examination of the affected area'thy past agony, and protection against overeating meats and drinks heavy with sustenance;
May if from mildness you forbid none cause, then he will lessen his meat intake and not approach flesh or drink.
When pressure is applied over bedridden patients with putrefaction or in the place where they rest and are immobilized sepsis occurs:
If you are secure with the application of caustic and it has been recently applied since his sanction (permission or approval) by doctor, then rest on the bedding so that dust/dirt not disturbing what was recommended for treatment using small doses does not settle there.
If the air has changed and become cold, then place a cloth inside while it is heated until it becomes healthy again.
May it be that the child is large or has insatiable appetite and thirst due to excessive space consumption through eating, without their lips being adjusted properly for drinking purposes; then align those things as recommended by the method of suturing them.
If the child is discovered within the bone and flesh, but not restrained by you with anything more than a small suspenderer, then inquire about that very thing, apply medicine to it as needed, restore the body's flesh back into its place of origin (the navel), and command the belly swelling caused by food allergies: capsules and tablets like those they consume or resemble.
If decay occurs in the spine and does not attach to the bone, then you must remove all this putrefied matter with water and apply care (attention).
If in these diseases an artery or vein through which the blood flows is not severed by medicine, then you should examine that vessel; and if it has been damaged but not cut open, pierce it with a sponge or lia (a metal implement), as required for what we have said does not cause discomfort. If further action is necessary to provoke this already opened artery/vein where medicine failed, then cauterize within the wound where the blood has stopped flowing.
If these pains are simple and small, then their cause is a feverish condition within; therefore, sprinkle this dust upon those places until the change in weather occurs to alleviate them.
The purpose of the polish (ointment) is as follows: take one part oil pressed from nuts, two parts dragon' extrême not consumed, three portions in total; all are ground and crushed together, with this mixture being filled into a container to be used while drinking it over that substance. Furthermore, blood clotting occurs within the same amount of said liquid due to lemon (sac), thus ensuring good absorption through consumption as medicine.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When any one performs only cautery alone, they are not in their own essence and sanctified blood of the serpent (medicinal drug derived from venom).
And now this operation takes place on the great humors when it is deemed necessary that they be stopped over them and are recently exacerbated, these humors whose air has not been disturbed.
If the air is altered, and especially in summer time, you may not comprehend this position of these extinglaus substances, then take care that those which we have mentioned before are applied upon them; let there be poultice made from flour kneaded with water and honey inside it to draw pus out—and ensure the other remedy is taken while they heal.
If there is a bone fracture in the body, and it requires attention, then extract water with care as directed by your movements.
When directing the treatment of skull fractures that are caused by poison (envenin), it is necessary to take appropriate measures immediately.
From the fluids of the colon (or possibly 'from/about' or 'concern
If the feces become acidic in the colon, there is no difference in medical treatment, and between these of the head when simple (or 'when' refers to a state or condition). This sentence suggests that an acidosis within the intestines does not necessitate different medical approaches compared to simpler conditions. The mention of handling issues related specifically with acidity implies concerns about digestion and possibly
If the nerves of the colon or an artery are injured (nervi), it is not in its own right, but rather to avoid treatment with water that causes strong stoppage symptoms; do so as if using zinc and silver remedies for these vessels nowhere near their nervous tissues. This suggests a cautious approach wherein certain treatments involving the application of specific substances (zinc and possibly metals like mercury, often used in historical medical practices) are recommended to address issues related to nerve damage or inflammation without exacsiting these conditions through aggressive interventions. The reference here is likely about using delicate balance with the remedies rather than applying harsh ones near sensitive structures like nervous tissue and blood vessels in colonic pathology, possibly implying a traditional approach to neurological dis No cause any blockage in the feces (no mention of constipation implied), and it is believed that this substance affects nerves without causing dizziness or continuous intoxication which would be detrimental to the brain, thus being essential for all body members. This line implies a belief about certain remedies not leading to adverse effects on cognitive functions like alertness (avoiding 'dizzyness' as per medieval terminology) and overall well-beносиce of
If the water (which is used for healing) lacks medicinal qualities and contains only distilled or non-distilled water when washed with it along with other stones according to this methodology, apply some oil poured into a pot or not, heat during bathing alongside these same pebbles as well as ointment on the skin.
If the child is large, administer stitches or close their lips together, and take care that they are healed with pills inside while being treated.
If there is depth or wounds in the lowest division of painful dissection, then it must be pierced at that location with a medicine needle for gout relief.
If in the soil there is an embedded artery and it has caused a flow of blood, then separate or dry out that one if necessary; otherwise, use caustic to induce drainage as needed.
If you have already positioned the spondyles of the vertebra or all, and thus saved the veins in the neck, then adjust your lips at the suture on the spinal column without touching it; as long as doing so does not disrupt its natural shape. Strengthen this part with wax during healing periods until recovery is complete; also apply care to ensure that there are no complications or excitement inside wherein they may become sickened.
Mayhaps if the child already has pain in the bone before treatment begins, you will strike that area; and if there are fragments of bones present, remove as many of those pieces as you can from them. If it is not possible for these to be removed internally, let them enter where they must so that the child may recover (heal), and thus detach (separate) what was fused together in their body (egeria).
If the patient is recently sick then crush some powder over that which has been recommended for you. May it be that if there is an opening (fistula) in the patient' extrinsic body, then treat and heal with water of which recollection will come to their head or skull.
If it is a throb or pressure from lance or cottle, and sometimes its depth varthy felt by the patient when their bowels are inflamed due to wind disorder of disease causing pus formation; you know that such fluid (pus) produced in decayed matter indicates death.
If there is no depth and the fluid has recently come out of their sanction (body), then stop in their abdomen during the first hour after morning shower time; don'thy not tighten that which keeps it trapped deep within its cavity, so as to return it to the chest and alleviate the malady, perhaps stopping with liniment applied thereafter.
If the ointment is not at hand, then pause in the bathroom and take water collected from above for that which comes out of humidities; apply it so that gout may rest on the ground where liquid has been adjusted to its place within you.
May you have passed three days or more without spasm of the chest cold or fever, tremors of ill health nor constriction of breathing; and if so, use the other good measures at your disposal, as knowledge dictates that the patient is saved (and thus cure them).
If the sanitation of him is considered sufficient and he has been cured for some time, then you already have a fistula formed; therefore attend to it with your own knowledge (your medical expertise).
If the swelling is due to an opening of space or cleft and it'se simple on the surface of the skin or chest/belly, then treat that with water previously used for suturing if large, or powder if small.
May there be pain in the bone already, and your fingers are numb, then use a tool to extract those stones if they have been separated. If they are not separated, then let them be washed out because their removal is facilitated.
When other accidents occur in the rest of the body, their healing is from the water we have mentioned before.
From abdominal pains/illnesses.
The discomgy that you feel in your abdomen is either great or small or wandering.
When a small disruption is caused by another'lauserly (someone or something), and the reduction of them becomes difficult unless you prevent their entrance into your place, then if they are already inhaled inside there, their bellies will swell up, making it hard for the intruder to be placed.
And so the best intervention is that it can easily move to its cavity; for in those parts where special devices have been mentioned, such reduction is difficult.
Be aware that the belly wound is divided into four directions, and if you need to place stitches on it, use common threads similar to those used for other diseases of the body.
Two other stitches communicate with each other and may do so even within the abdominal suture itself.
In English line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise text provided would be as follows:
So when the child is small and suffers from some cause of a hernia (budel), it'thy reduction becomes difficult; either because of its diminutive size, as mentioned earlier, or if due to inflation caused by cold air:
When water is flowing inwardly (or seeping into the cloth you're immersing alone or wetting while dipping), and when cloves, cinnamomancy, peppercorns, and bandages are applied within where inflammation can be resolved.
When some measures have been taken in which water has entered as treatment for inflammation, it is better than the water alone itself at resolution of the swelling.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in which it was located and where there were violets and marshmallow (the humble plant), thereby easing its pain due to a little cause.
If there is relief from the patient' extramundry matter for this treatment, then divide the rupture into small pieces with a tool to which they have been previously inserted (implanted).
The initial text for translation reads as follows in English line by line:
From the tool, its shape is thus:
One sharp turn of the bed, and another not so acute, as well as the subtlety that is not a part of thin bone - here they make an obtuse angle (perhaps referring to adjusting or positioning parts of the patient's bed or body with specific angles for therapedict purposes).
And when the worm is increased and comes out of the intestine, it'thy reduction should be according to its own shape in its proper place, if at all feasible on top of that; four times better is this approach.
When the disruption is wide open and it' extrudes down into your lower abdomen; then make sure you press on their hernia with one hand, placing cushions under them as needed, while also holding onto their head cap (and putting supports beneath).

Here comes the first sentence to translate: And if they migrate between hardness and subtlety, as needles move into flesh; large ones are difficult in the navel area, so that's why they may travel through delicacy and coarseness.
Even if the needle is placed in either of the limbs foretold hereinabove (referring to previous instructions), so that the flesh does not become incised and filthiness appears before its healing, thus ensuring a clean recovery process.
And ensure that it is not extended with stitches so that flesh cannot heal properly.
Here comes the first source sentence for translation:
These surgical needles are placed in a mannerly way within the small wounds, and it suffices for their stitching either one or two of those needles, which hold them together.
May the second stitch be common: and it is that you insert a needle into the four extremities of the chest, from shoulder to fingers, using both delicacy and thickness with the tool in hand.
When the needle is in these four extremities, reduce the needle of that surgeon' extricated portion to prevent its filthy contents from rising up into another part and for the stitching to follow a cloth-bound thread as per usual:
When there is a pause in any of its stitches, determine the quantity of the thick part of that wound.
This stitch knows how men should be treated.
And with such a suture, he had bound the child who was ill in his belly where there was a large swelling of an egg-sized size caused by distension (swolthy) and disruption within the womb due to breech presentation; thus, having reduced that which the intestine protruded through for twenty-four hours.
When the child is solidified within these spaces for fifteen days or so, and it heals therefrom; after five years of motion, it becomes healthy in its disposition.

And when the needle enters the coccyx and also into that portion of the body where you have inserted it, stretching throughout all parts of the body as far down to my hand's tip; let the other end of the lance enter the opposite extremity of what has been entered.
When you have pain in that area, then make another attempt to relieve it within the limits of this body segment from one end to the other; and let the protrusion outside reach here too, making penetration there as well with an arrowhead.
When filth seeps into your body, entering the cavity where it all enters at that extreme end of yours which is inside you and infiltrates throughout your entire being therein; thus, when this happens with a pointed cautery to enter:
E begins at this side of the body and takes that up to its extreme, piercing through there with a needle from the coccyx (tailbone), inserting it into that place in the other end of the spine on which we are operating; then removes that inserted needle also back out from where you took it.

May the second specialty of suture proper that Gualia discusses today and which is spoken about here for guidance purposes, consists of taking this middle part (possibly referring to an intermediate treatment method) where heals are being created by local medication practitioners; applying another limb'dictum on one extremity and the reflected principle from it onto the other extremity. Do so as directed in today's discussion for optimal division/segmentation of body parts according to nature:
Where you keep the needle at your chosen distal part of departure, and make that pierce through to another division in that spot, then turn over (or rotate) the needle so it penetrates from one limb's two extremities into those same divisions on the other.
When those joints are turned around (possibly meaning twisted or rotated), allowing for knee capsules to enter the distal parts of other limbs that lie against the body' extraneously, in two extremities at a time.
This stitching is better than ordinary sewing and it facilitates memory recall of the wound healing process.
This is the speech of Guiliel (or William)
And if you need to insert an umbilical catheter using two needles for the stitching of the abdomen, so that you can place it between these thorns according to what you must do with this inserted needle and make it penetrate into the other suture made by them who sew inside your body.

When you understand that what is in large intestines is a milder cure than what resides within the small intestines, this understanding indicates knowledge of more effective treatments for diseases associated with each part of the bowel (intestines). Here 'budel' refers to the gut or intestines. The phrase suggests that conditions in large
When the issue addressed by "gegunu" is not receiving cure in its entirety due to several factors: because of the vast network of veins within it and their complexity; as well as the large size, which corresponds with that particular structure (likely referring again to a part or organ like intestines); influenced furthermore by subtle characteristics inherent to this entity's anatomy along with its proximity—or closeness/relationship in nature—to nerves. Here 'gegunu' possibly refers to the large and small bowels, as is common medical terminology for discussing intestinal issues; "plagua" suggests a blockage or accumulation of waste material within this context ("the coughed-up stuff"); understanding these factors can be crucial in determining effective treatments.
When the cause of this situation is a filtration process (potentially related to fecal matter or waste), you manage it directly with something recently applied on your abdomen, whereby adjusting according to that specific point—likely referring back to an external application like applying medicine or therapy. Here 'tela' implies the filtering mechanism within perhaps a medical device; and following this management step allows for reducing swelling (or "budels") in places you have previously treated with compressive
When space has been occupied and black substance (likely referring to blood or other biological material) is extracted from there, you press down firmly on that area where it was darkened by the presence of said matter—presumably relating back once again to intestinal issues. Here 'fluxs de sanc' means flowing discharges; and emphasizing direct contact ("a fiel") with this affected spot could be crucial in clearing out these congested fluids, which might suggest dealing with something like a blockage or an infected area where blood vessels (veins and arteries) are involved. This line points towards physical intervention possibly as

And experienced practitioners who when the patient is in the hernia, as directed here: take large cauteries; and adjust the lips of the entrapped individual with these tools while holding a swelling from above their mouth on their lip – once they clutch them tightly, it adheres and does not dissolve.
And when resting is required for the first time or formation of another body part is needed according to the amount of all matter in it, do not cease this process.
Reduce that and place it inside the belly, and remove those adherent caps from within the hernia so that the hernia will heal; without causing harm to anyone' extruded bowel (i.e., a potential leakage of intestinal contents).
And it is possible that the intestine has been drawn out undernethyte careless attention of this same patient's body parts (animals), inserted with a needle; and you hold on to these extremities, detaching them carefully, wrapping one in thread, placing another between nails/thorns back onto it within the intestine, thereby reducing its displacement.
This procedure of stitching is only a second means of trust and hope.
If the child is large and wide, mainly if it's in one of the small intestines, then they are not immediately visible but rather subtlety internalized, and there will be no cure for them at all by now.

May those who restore the fracture of another limb not yet healed at table time make an error according to their practice; this great fear, and if they were right-handed, it would expand the Ancients in times when they are free and strong enough.
And you have not seen any doctor for this fluid (presumably referring to blood or bodily fluids related to the condition), which makes it reasonable that there will be nothing done about it.
Capitol second: When you break a bone in the head.
The spices of breaks are motes (small particles), and their figures are various, with different causes: for one type is caused by the percussion of a space, which immediately enters into contact with bones in such way that it becomes attached; or when said space incides some part of the bone itself, where you penetrate flesh without passing beyond to its underside; this kind of fracture breakdown (fracture) is known as lifting away absolute.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
This break or foreign object has already been applied to the periosteum (the outer layer of bone), and it may be either large or small within these broken bones; if it is in the face of the bone, its contents will remain there.
When a bone is broken in the subtlety of hair length and for this reason it is called this specific type of microscopic fracture.

Mostly it hurts in the bones of the joints when they are wet with phlegm (a type of humor), as occurs alongside feverish conditions like a cold from excessive sweating or breathing heavily at high altitudes.
And as for all these severe breaks or splints that have been applied, they are set apart like separate pillows. When all of it returns back to its place in his body.
And with all these means of breaking down for detection and inquiry into their intended uses and the decayed flesh that is upon them.
A special vessel is noticed when it comes out through the bone and is restrained there on top of which a fracture appears black (indicating healing or possibly an infection).
May consider the maladies of humours in healing fractures, and if through those accidents signs manifest fear as vomiting from cholera, distension, loss of comprehension, abscesses, syncope, acute fever, and examination/consultation of their pus and cries, they do not improve.
If you witness an injury that is not in order, then you begin its cure.
When the cause is that it has come into your body during meals with food and water on days of rain when you study bones in the middle part of the day, twelve times a day; after studying, cover yourself completely as if under attack by wind and cold (rain).
If it is in the summer days, then you should cover your head with a cloth until noon, as daylight rots (damages) the skin and brings on incidents that have been foreseen.
If the fracture has already reached the brain covering (meninges), and involves small bones and arthritis, then cover the broken pieces with soft materials as I recommend.
When you raise the head of the patient affected by swelling and discover it on their second position according to what is customary for treating such cases in children, making them lie over the swolthy area as well.
If you need to examine the bone and use sanoc or apesta cauterization, then hold yourself away from water that is coming out, and bring lined with cloth dipped in wine and oil soaked fabric into where the inflammation is located; this will help calm down the abscessed area. You start at the site of the bone lesion and begin debridement (removal).
And it is either one of two methods for operation.
The one mania is that you insert into the wound such an instrument and this is how it's done: Insert another similar tool for just a little more than what was inserted before; this is also how it should be done.
And apply medication with forceps that are second-hand if necessary.

It is convenient that you grasp these many ladders for each part of the bone, as long as this sharp point wherein lies your mind'thy extremity (the tip or sensitive area), is within all of your brain chambers at once; and according to the amount of detail required by said joints in both length and brevity.
This is the form of three kinds of trepanation: The quality that perforates through the broken bone structure is where you pause and twist this tool on the bone, knowing it has already penetrated; then directs the craniotome to another location, stopping when all interruption caused by the size of the shard or fragment.

When a nose is broken, it implies that there has been an injury leading to the fracture of one or more bones
Understand that the nose is not broken but divided into pieces belonging to various parts of it; and in this condition there are two bones involved here, one being cartilaginous (the septum), which isn't actually fractured nor does it suffer any cuts or cracks. Instead, these issues manifest as distortion, twisting, and possibly displacement—all symptoms of a nasal deformity rather than a clean break in the nose bone itself.
May it be if one of the bones is broken in their body, then you insert a small object into your nose to align that fracture and place it outside their mouth, until they return back according to their natural shape of the nose. If it is for your ease (to make things easier) and ensure that you do not harm the patient' extraneous operation on their thighs.

If the jawbone is broken into two pieces, then cover it with extension of bone segments inside so that there's possibility for its repair (or healing).
If inflammation of the teeth causes disruption, then apply pressure to those from which you hope that they will stop bleeding into gold or silver (or mercury), and place your hand above the broken jawbone crater, and also over the doubled cloth drape; a finger placed along the length of the jawbone alone—this is only for when it dresses you in its layered leather garment and decides to apply this (the treatment). Ensure that nothing gets destroyed.
And command the humors that it rest and calm down, stopping food from being absorbed by its intestines (lions). Here 'malaute' refers to what is commonly known as digestion or stomach in modern medical terminology; this medieval text uses metapdicts for explanation. The phrase "leons
If you observe an alteration in the figure due to any malaise (illness), then take care of yourself and rectify what has already been changed within it; apply ointment made from talc, alabaster or barley flour on your body over which a wool cloth is bound as plaster. Here 'malaieyra' refers to an illness causing change in the figure/body shape (possibly referring to swelling). The passage suggests applying remedies like ointments from talc, alabaster or barley flour on affected areas and covering with wool cloth bound as plaster. It implies a home-based treatment approach using readily available materials for healing purposes during the third day of observation (perhaps referring to an incubation period).
And so when this plaster is set on the body (of an injured patient), and there's no change in their bone structure, leave it undisturbed as long as they are healed strong enough for a fracture; keep moving gently with this treatment method over three days. Here 'annex e ajusta emplastre sobre lu,' refers to applying plaster on the body (often used metaphorically). The instruction is that if there's no deformation or alteration of bone structure after application, it should be left in place until sufficient healing strength for a fracture has been restored. This suggests adhering strictly to rest and careful movement as part of the treatment protocol over three days following an injury (possibly involving
If another wound occurs after a poultice has been applied, then apply what we have mentioned for those ulcers inside the body until it heals and cures that ulceration.
If the fracture is in childhood (implied by "am plagna"), consider whether it is due to bone being pulled apart or dislocated ("satagias"), then gently remove those things that bring fluid into alignment with where they belong within the joint spaces of these particular bones.
If the urine of a patient is thin (streit), then you should increase it as per your need using bloodletting according to its quantity.

Movements made often break the shoulder of the departed from the joint, and this fracture is considered in one of three ways.
When it is broken or separated into parts not subject to setting (that is, those without marrow), and restoration in these places is difficult or impossible—as when the bone has been crushed like mud; where healing occurs slowly or cannot occur at all: such a fracture.
When the operation in that case occurs because of a broken jawbone, it is necessary to have two ministers present: one holds his tongue and supports the fractured jaw, while the other extends the chest over that divided area.
And apply the splint on the broken bone within where it has been set according to how much and in what manner it is formed, ensuring that there are neither small heights nor depressions present.
If indigestion extends for a long time, then rest and apply pressure with linen or wool as needed according to your requirement; raise the chest and compress the swelling where you apply pressure until relieved.
If you cannot lift the extremity of the shoulder to the parts behind, it will reach the spine and cause distension above its neck, with pressure applied over a portion of his limb moving upwards significantly.

If the disruption of the wound you've sealed when extracting the splinter from the bone is securely dressed with a bandage, then adjust your fingers to close the wound on the flesh.
If the rupture is slight or if you fear abscess formation, then apply pus and powders according to the quantity of the wound' extrusion.

When the fracture of the coast occurs, it is not in large areas that they crack apart; rather, from their limbs' detachment following separation and due to waters which are as hard as cuttlebone upon them. This passage implies a medical understanding consistent with humoral theories prevalent during medieval times: when parts (possibly body appendages) of the patient separate because of some kind of physical trauma, they should not be immediately driven into an even worse condition but rather treated delicately to prevent further damage—a concept that can also metapfortically resonate with contemporary discussions about first aid and immediate And I understand it is not a matter of fear on your mind when seeking the truth from these tales or stories, but rather curiosity about what they truly are.

The restoration should be attempted with tools that are as flexible and strong as possible according to necessity; apply bandaging or splints directly over the broken bones if needed, based on what is available at hand. This advice indicates an early understanding of immobilization techniques for fractures—an essential aspect in modern emergency care practices where stabilizing a break can significantly aid healing and prevent further injury until professional medical treatment can be provided. Here we see the intermingling of practical medieval wisdom with enduring principles that underpin today's first-aid protocols, such as immobilization using available materials to support broken limbs—an approach still relevant in settings where immediate advanced care is not accessible or

If in your bone'thy construction there are excessive stones present within it at its place due to the black urine of yours, perform a thorough cleaning throughout that body part with whatever means you have under control by yourself (i.e., using tools or methods available).
If there appears in the patient separate signs that push down the ribs and are not within your hope for recovery, then you must attend to them according to our instructions herein described above.
May if the bone is still wet (fresh), you have hurt it once already and therefore take care of that injury specifically.
If you harden the cauterum at your patient' extrication site, then thread wax dyed with rosin and white chalk through it; wind a fine cloth tightly between precision and subtlety around that rigid medium until the cauterism gives way; afterward apply mollified clay dust prepared in lime ash to the pause bandage you've applied, securing thereupon with padded metal stitches which have been previously positioned on top of said fracture and inserted below it.
And you know that the name of the bones in the arm is found in major positions or there's a fracture at one or two points simultaneously engaged.

Evening coverings for the fracture should be soft and not hard or stiff; they must allow one to move naturally as if having them at home while we heal.
Consider the body part and its softened tissue today. If any injury occurs that requires correction, address it immediately to the affected limb, and make sure you bandage or secure it there until the bleeding stops.
Leaves the limb confined within that resting period, and returns the tightness back on it.
If extraction has been softened and the bone seems to these again, then straighten out all of it as per your will.

The phrase "restauracio de fractura" refers to the treatment of a bone break, while "ma e dels ditz" translates as "the middle finger and little fingers." Therefore
The sentence in English would be: "Know that the middle finger and little fingers of both hands can break under strain without immediate consequence; do not assume they are just sprains." This statement suggests caution, indicating that fractures may occur even with seemingly minor injuries to these areas and proper medical attention is necessary for an accurate diagnosis.
The English translation for this line would be: "When you suspect the middle finger fracture or sprain, then immediately seek care and have them lie down on their side with two-thirds of equal length." This advice indicates an immediate response is necessary upon recognizing a possible bone injury. The person should prioritize prompt medical evaluation by having themselves or someone else immobilize the arm in a specific position—lying on one's side, which suggests placing some form of support (possibly with pillows) to keep it extended at an angle that follows two-thirds rule for optimal care
Translated into English, the sentence reads: "Extend and support those broken bones with a good grip as directed by the doctor." This instruction tells one to properly immobilize fractured bones using an appropriate device or material (implied here) that ensures stability until professional medical help is available. It emphasizes following precise guidance, likely for proper handling of injuries before definit
Translated into English: "And cover with plaster and bandage if not suffering from an open wound; pause the splint according to the extent of injury, which you have already wrapped in a cloth." This sentence provides guidance on treating injuries before medical help arrives. It tells one how to apply appropriate first-aid measures—using materials like plaster and bandage for immobilization (splinting) and wrapping with fabric if an open wound is present, implying that different care methods are required based on the type of injury observed or suspected upon arrival at a medical
If the injury is in the parts of your belly and it appears like drape threads, then command the humors to tighten that area with you using your hand' extrusion (or finger), making them as strong/long as a cloth thread; this will help strengthen or restore proper function.
And if it is necessary for the body (corpo) to rest on a cloth wherein it rises, tighten that second one as well.
If the fracture is in parts afar off, then halt where you pause on two pieces of that part which are far from each other and place it with your hand so that it becomes secured and tight; also stop the swelling, as soon as you have rotated your hand between the fingers' ligaments.
If you have caused a crack in the bones of your leg, and it is their foot that has been broken, then do as follows: straighten it according to where the break occurred; apply pressure with one hand on its palm (and if desired), pause for four days so that the fracture rises upward, preventing it from becoming crooked.
May it be the same as in that joint where warmth is present or at its location, or on the knee, elbow, ankle, or little toe; if they are all fractured simultaneously and continuously, then hold onto what was here indicated for this part. Or pause over a small stone (probably referring to something used as stabilization), just like we do with our foot.

From the healing of a hip bone fracture.
The bones of the thigh are worn down and declared according to what is converted into motion at once in that area, below (the upper body).
The restoration of him is done in such a way that the sinew is tightened over the fracture and another ligament right after the fracture, with muscle being pressed down on his abdomen and face.
Whenever the minister extends it completely according to the quality of bone at which the break occurs in the joint,
If it is provided for the wound of the thigh, then tie one sinew to the tendon at the site of the femoral region, thus preventing extension in their joints and holding together another sinew that has already been broken.
And if the dislocation is proposed for daytime, then make it with strong binding and extend it to all parts at once.

The text describes traditional methods for immobilization using body parts like hands (or cautery), as well as simple tools such as a splint, during medieval
Apply pressure between the thigh and knee with towels or clothes as they lie on top of each other, in order that blood may clot (or stop bleeding). This suggests an early attempt at controlling hemorrhage using bandaging techniques before modern medical dressings were available.
Start with tight bandaging directly on the location of the break using three or four layers (or dressings), and as you move away from this area at your pace for restraint should be lessened, keeping it moist. This indicates a gradual release technique commonly used in medieval times to stabilize injuries before more advanced medical treatment was available; by loosening the bandage slightly further outwards they aimed not to cut off circulation but ensure sufficient pressure to prevent excessive bleeding and maintain hygiene with periodic moistening.
Extend your fingers towards the parts where they enter at the groin of patient's body and hold them firmly (or grip tight), ensuring that bandages or wrappings on other parts are secure, so as not to be accidentally removed from their place; this suggests a method used by medieval doctors for immobilization while treating injuries with minimal tools available at the time. The practice likely served both therapeutic and precautionary purposes — keeping bandages in position could prevent further injury or interference during treatment, as well as reducing pain through applied pressure where needed without over-restricting blood flow to other parts of the body that were not directly involved with
Here comes the translation of the medieval medical treatise:
If bone pain from the joint that was set in place by you is felt again, then it must be touched gently with what can be done to you; and if not possible, press on it firmly until healed, taking care of whatever preceded this recollection for recovery.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And in some cases this hip crack is even more strenuous than when we have previously mentioned it here and on our arm (assistant).
Even after such restoration in this manner does not heal the patient'thy limp; and if restored alone, another application of that cushion is necessary for him who continues lame from where they were stiffened before.
Be aware that the thigh is strong in forty days or a few months, and all this depends on the variety of complexions and other dispositions.

If the child falls sick and bleeds from where it was injured (and there is no other cause for this), then you should apply pressure to stop the bleeding on that spot until help arrives or another reason presents itself.
When you begin restoring the fracture on that day, do not extend it further unless there is suppuration (formation of pus due to infection).
If you apply cauterization for the ulcer, then heal it within one day after applying the treatment until the ulcer subsides; and do not treat them on the third or fourth day in total, so that no harmful incidents occur.
If your bone is broken and protrudes above the neck (the place where it connects to other parts of the body), then you must take care not only to reduce that which has been fractured but also ease movement thereof, making those actions easy and brief in duration.
May you not extend beyond what is prepared, and the patient'sinclinations are in your hands; it is this very tool that has been made of iron, with a length between seven or eight digits (hand spans), and its width according to the quantity required by each case for all types of fracture. Therefore, it is necessary for the doctor to grind these three or four pieces as needed in the course of treatment.

Tending this knotting carefully in the signs of healing a fracture occurs mainly at joints and largely influenced by the figure/shape of the affected limb, it is strictly forbidden to interf0rrupt its operation as if removing or altering something natural. (This translation addresses medieval practices regarding treatment after bone repair where care was taken not to disturb what could be seen as an essential part of healing.)
Therefore consider if the knotting is recent and administer in that medicine which has fixed pain relief with henbane or mandragore roots, ivy leaves (known as comfrey), nettle heads (astringent properties) mixed together like those; ensuring these are applied to some or all of them tightly against the suture made from linen waxed and bound. Keep pressure on it using a soft cloth pressed upon this area for proper compression, maintaining that knot's integrity throughout healing as directed in such therapedictions involving specific plants known today primarily by their historical uses or botanical characteristics rather than current medical understanding.

In order to provide an accurate translation of "Capitol .xxiii.",
This appears to be a Latin phrase possibly taken from the context provided, which may relate to bodily
This Latin phrase translates into English as: "Dislocation is an injury to any of the joints in its place, which prohibits movement and requires medical intervention; it brings upon large pains and bruises." This line describes a dislocated limb leading to severe pain and immobility.
When a person suffers from a dislocation, it's necessary to perform immediate actions for its reduction and not delay doing so; if there is such a delay, the location becomes numb and making an attempt at reducing the dislocation then proves difficult according to doctors’ advice. This passage underscores urgency in treating limb dislocations promptly before complications arise due to lack of immediate care.
Therefore do not let someone be maimed or stretched out at the moment of numbness; as it often happens that continuous movement provokes muscle spasms and severe pain following dislocation, indicating immediate medical attention is crucial to prevent additional injury from attempting inappropriate movements. This advice stresses on immobilizing a limb immediately after an incident until professional help arrives or further instructions are given by healthcare professionals.
When the patient is conscious and able to move at all, guide them gently back into position where they can rest while awaiting further assistance; then brace their dislocated limb with blankets or folded materials for support during immobility until help arrives. Additionally, bend their arm proximally (nearest the body) downwards and outwards at the elbow joint to reduce—ease—dislocation of these parts by an experienced individual as needed before medical intervention occurs, simplifying subsequent handling or treatment procedures according to healthcare providers' guidance in medieval times. This line from a medieval treatise suggests practical first aid steps for dealing with dislocations when professional help is delayed while emphasizing the importance of careful and knowledgeable personal assistance during such

If the abdomen is swolthy (swollen), then cover it with what else causes him to be suspended; thus he will become gravely ill and may return distorted (dislocated).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another method of reduction is as follows: place a long staff on top of which there's still some figure (likely referring to an instrument for medical intervention), similar to a mortar but not thick nor thin, and position it above their knees immediately. The patient’s leg must be supported by the head of this staff with cushions undernethy legs; simultaneously, adjust its length along the entirety ofthe stick accordingly as per each limb's section at once (possibly referring to realignment), strengthening that part for faster healing upon reunion.
If it is difficult to reduce him for all the reasons mentioned previously, then use this treatment as follows: grasp a staff with an amount that extends beyond two arm's length and hold at about four fingers' distance. The size of his belly should be pushed into the position indicated by these rules herein described.
Over his head place these heavy cloths for that the chest will not descend into disease.

When the limb' extrusion is completed in any manner that you can manage to do so, and when you pause intermittently for patient spit of wool fleece as much quantity; then apply a plaster prepared with molten lead and egg white over all muscle mass, thus ensuring it rotates above the area where there's constriction. Then fixate the ligament on top of this cast, connect your arm to the patient’s chest, making sure not for humpback; apply forceful taps at points near strictures and ensure immobilization with the plaster as well – none should be heard from them over seven days.
When food from excess (malady) is restrained and the body part feels comfortable, then it leads to healing for that person.
And if it is provided with more food and proper exercise, then already when closed (meaning by being rested) or not softened (possibly referring to a lack of movement), the patient begins to heal.
If the joint is dislocated due to moisture that you inflict upon it or for another reason, then in that case three kinds of cautery are applied as described in the treatise on cauterization.
If all this pain is present and the ligament or joint isn'thy closed for seven days, then the bandage and sprain are reduced upon you a few times, and it doesn’t close nor hurt when elevating that arm to the parts above, indicating knowledge that these nerves of yours, which run through the chest muscle (which may be rigid or softened/mollified), have not been stuck in place for any time.
When the dislocation is caused by force and extension in the knee and chest areas, reduction must be made with a push and an extension movement until it returns to normal positioning.

From care for the detachment of the thigh bone.
You understand that the hip joint is dislocated with difficulty and appearance; it's dislocated throughout all parts, mainly towards the back part, where its position can be adjusted by gentle handling or touch as per any shape in which it has been dislocated, and when you align the dislocated hip, that itself becomes evident. For then, the joint is concave and cannot bend the leg nor make contact with this very muscle.
When you encounter the hips, reduce it as much so that a cauterous application can occur; if such treatment is applied to relieve ulceration (apothecem), healing becomes difficult and not fully complete unless care of all other parts affected by dislocation also occurs. Especially when these are present at posterior divisions, they comprise the entirety of species related to displacement and major pain, accompanied with urgent movements towards that location; ultimately leading potentially to death if untreated.
And when the restoration is possible, it'dict that his chest should be expanded and stretched outwards; likewise for the arms of him/her must also expand with hands held tightly at their waist or under the palm entering into position to restore movement in joints. Here comes a source sentence translation:
If the dislocation occurs in their parts near here, return immediately by folding your hand into its own place; when it touches the joint of their wrist (the back of the hand), then you have arrived there quickly enough to treat properly.
If dislocation does not obey reduction, apply strong extension and forceful motion.
When two ministers stretch out their arms, they hold each other' extrusion is prevented from occurring.
And return his arm completely turned around, placing a long folded cloth or bandage over the body of him/her, with leather straps (or lycra).

If you see the joint not moving freely, then apply the bandage and ligature to it, leaving them in place for several days until it is outgrown; after that return (it).
May you apply pressure to the reduction of the joint, and its position is in motion, applying moist and dry massage techniques until it subsides; when there's continued movement at the site of fatty tissue inflammation (hernia), place a bandage on it. Lay this directly over the bone during daytime and nighttime. Return that which is placed therein, and immerse the same in bath; when suctioned, rub at the joint with warm ointment repeatedly on it until moving becomes smooth, one wash-up session later for this purpose, another after three times have been applied. Am inside where it should be (referring to returning something to its correct place), enter when it is ready/prepared (entero).
And if you wish (implied subject is possibly the practitioner), pause over that wet and split gap by the cow' extraneous border area; lay your hand firmly on it for some moments (quar aquella es humida); this will dry out, returning to its proper disposition/state.

Concerning the care for joint displacement between the arm and body, it pertains to that junction where the limb joins with the torso.
When some of the parts are displaced and reducing its dislocation is difficult or happens at other joints too quickly so that there may be a spontaneous reduction (i.dict when it suddenly returns to its normal position), then:
The reduction of the dislocation is that you stop the joint between the muscle of the groin on a table and extend it from there; the doctor places their hand or palm over the impending joint, pushing it back into its place.
Mays if it is considered that the palm has been placed on her stomach and hips rest upon a table extended outward to stretch and reduce; and if there was prior dislocation, then its position should be such that their body lies over this intrinsic structure of the hip joints atop the table, so that the doctor's hand can cover it from any imminent articulation.
And if it returns soon, good things will follow; but if not, that portion may become inflamed and must be cast away before wounds are inflicted or treated in the process of reduction (the return to normal position). Do not interrupt until tomorrow has passed since actions taken today might affect treatment for a day.
Must the joint according to its twistiness; and there is nothing in Mael (the patient), but it has been softened, with no cause for strangulation present; you know that the nerves are compressed or spasmed, and not herein where they should be stiff through cautery preparation of Lucca'dictorium and strong water to provide a possible cause.
So when they return uncomfortable (malassem), place the one applied bandage on them, and have their stay there with rest for days; also separate it out and exercise that area of skin above, doing so regularly throughout these days.

The provided lines appear to be in medieval medical Latin or an archaic form of Spanish, Italian, or French that closely resembles these languages due to the language structure and lexicon used (
When any of these bones is dislocated from the two parts of their socket (palm or abdomen), one must place back the displaced bone into its sockets and apply pressure therewith until they return to position. Here'dict, "alcun dit" refers generally to a single affected bone; 'dislocacio de lu' means dislocation of that particular body part or limb being referred to in this context (which could be any extremity depending on the missing information). The text outlines an initial approach for handling such
Here it instructs to support the head of the limb affected by immobilizing that particular section and suspending (likely via splinting or bandaging) for two days. This is a typical medieval treatment approach aimed at stabilization following trauma like dislocation before further intervention: "E prop" means 'so' as an instruction to take this specific action, while
And suspend and extend it within which day the bone is properly aligned in its socket ('engulha' refers to alignment or positioning). This suggests that after immobilization, a period of extension might be applied as part of the treatment protocol: "Exten" indicating '
When the bone is not immobilized at night (which implies a rest period for healing), then continue suspending it and gradually reintroducing movement, alternating between daytime care when active intervention occurs, to evening where observation continues: "No cesses desliar" means 'do not cease removal,' suggesting that proper management of the limb (likely in this case a dislocated one) is critical even during periods intended for rest and healing. The intention seems clear—careful monitoring followed by progressive mobilization as part of recovery: "Lia aquel en la noyt" refers to continuous

The phrase regarding treatment for the displacement of thoracic vertebrae translates line by line into English as:
When the back or neck vertebrae are displaced completely and motionless spinal bones appear in that place, which is not cured at all; thereafter death enters through the abdomen (the malady).

So then it has become inflamed at the back parts and is completely purpled.
May the treatment of him be that you consider if there is an excessive yellowness caused by infancy, which neither healing nor cure applies to this individual in general.
May enter through castration or palpation (or seemingly) to these things; they have learned the art of curing by long conversation, from which may return with proficiency; and even if he/she has already opened up that part where fluid accumulates due to its excessive amount, for their near proximity leads them back here in order to expel it using various tools brought about (from this place), thus cleaning out what they have exposed.
From those it is not healed but that which you apply directly into their body, and what they drink as recommended by him cures them fully.
It is that the humidity extends over their face above the chest area of their body, and it spreads quickly through the abdomen to ensure that their navel does not come into contact with the wetness.

The minister holds the staff and it is not fixed in a ditch; another servant also holds an identical form to that of him/her.
When the bandage covers the head of the thigh and tightens the linen laced around it, extending its length to cover the head itself; place another sling over the legs holding them down with cushions undernethyoungs, then adjust all straps so they fit on the other staff which holds your feet in position.
Here the minister extends the ligament to the part of the beam, but they should not be overlapping or crossing each other at all here (as previously mentioned).
The doctor presses their hands on the spine for strength to return it, or places them on that particular table and adjusts their weights there until they come back.
May not return through this form; then take a table of which the length or width is three feet, and dig into the wall where we previously indicated that the malady (illness/disease) resides within its extreme limit of the table' extrinsic part. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to hold what has been turned over on the chest; and it is that you must stay with your back against the thighs of the patient for as long as two sticks, whose length equals one arm's span, and keep your head between their legs at the end of these same two sticks – such a distance equates to about a palm in width; where it has been turned over you will find movement within each stick which should not be moved from the ground lest they become gouty.
And take a staff in which he turns and rotate it on the two halves of both staves.
In the limb there is a defect in which it forms the staff'dict length of a hand that has been turned, and on the two other staves they appear similar to this one.
Return the ligaments that have been stretched in the groin area where you must lift your leg and those that have been strained in the hips, which are necessary to support their feet when they stand up.
When each part must be supported by one of them and the doctor manipulately adjusts the spine as we have described:
And I placed back the spine in its position and covered it with cloth; above this filling of plaster paste from an album or board is three inches thick (or as much as needed to fill out where there's numbness), which length corresponds to how far down into the area affected by palsy, overlying on top of the spine.

Here, "liament" likely refers to connective tissue or a structure supporting joints. The translation focuses on traditional methods of tre
If there is any urgency in the location at the end of treatment, those who are administering medicine have recommended that it be applied and managed over a long time within the frame (referring to an area or structure where interventions occur), which we advise; this has already been applied on-site with plaster. Here again there is advice for continuity in medical care post-treatment, using methods such as casting—indicating that sustained treatment and monitoring are important aspects of medieval healthcare practices to ensure proper healing following an injury or surgical intervention. The use of casts made from materials like plaster was a common practice aimed at immobilizing broken bones for optimal recovery, reflecting the practical application of medical knowledge during that era.
Experiences of urgency are observed at the lower vertebrae due to dislocation; and these experiences prevent further application here with this medicine for now, as it could potentially lead you closer than ever before in your life's end (implying a high risk). Here again we stress that extreme caution must be taken not only during but also after treatment. This statement underlines the gravity of medical conditions related to spinal injuries and their potential consequences on one’s health, particularly when compounded with severe dislocations—highlighting an acute awareness in medieval medicine regarding life-threatening situations resulting from skeletal trauma that required immediate attention. The use of precise language like "potentially lead to your end" indicates the high mortality rates associated with injuries during
Capitol XXVII.
Of hock joint dislocation.
Understand that the joint between the thigh and the muscle does not deviate significantly but becomes dislocated only slightly, without causing pain in other smaller body connections with curvature or concave nature which you might otherwise injure when bending them elsewhere.
When the large joint is dislocated according to four ways—in parts of the limbs forward, behind, above or below—it means that:
Mostly it is dislocated at the joints below and scarcely in the parts before or behind them.
When the dislocation of his limb is at its parts, when you adjust the sling for hernia healing (involving putting it around and tightening), this elongation puts pressure on what was healthy before, preventing the protruded organ from bending backward with tongues or fingers used to pinch.
When the name of that body which has been dissected is concerned with parts beyond its natural state, it means that their accidents are contrary to this incident.
When the name of that individual to whom dislocation occurs is read aloud as soon as possible after exposure through a cushion under their leg (second complement), but even so it may not alleviate the pain present in the joint, and if penetration worsens leading them away where they cannot bear weight on their limbs; urine retention occurs within him/her, and an abscess forms at his/her location. Thus, he/she must walk on their toes.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May the reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and if the dislocation is ancient and old, then it has already been addressed by the treatment I administer here, according to its disposition; therefore there'thy no more symptomatic sign. And so we need not concern ourselves further in that particular cure.
In that where the dislocation is recent and one of the four species of dislocation, you must reach the joint to return it into place and extend it towards both limbs' parts above and below, making sure not to be distracted by other treatments.
May happen if not returns in this treatment phase: then prepare and spread out the cushion from where you started placing it under their legs quickly or hold them tightly with a thread that is tied over the underside of the cushion; another servant extends said thread upward, bringing hands close to touching each other' extramitely.
When extension occurs from the shoulder or between the ribs towards the breastbone joint, or from one side of the chest to the other.
When all of them are extended within a period where the malady rises up to its place on earth and begins to descend,
This particular form of extension occurs in all four (of them/people).
So if the detachment returns due to water we have mentioned, do so quickly (immediately); otherwise, it is necessary for all special waters that describe its own treatment.
In the patient's own reduction, when dislocated, and the displacement is at its joint parts, so that the malady settles on their backbone; there should be pause of the ligaments in the groin area where between the top of the hip and where it protrudes downwards (the pubis); place extension along with force upon the limb part closest to the shoulder blade from whence they are torn.
Here comes another servant with strong pulsation to rub the thighs of him/her, and press firmly on the bulk of the hernia area in order for it to return swiftly there itself.
This particular substance is for purulent inflammation, by which this member is reduced and other species are relieved from it.
May you be excused for this specific type of healing care we are providing today; since the two legs at the base of your thighs serve as pillars holding us firmly together, both feet and toes being connected by ligaments on each leg.
Whenever any part of the body exceeds four digits in length and when one thigh'supreme extends more than two fingers long, it suggests an imbalance or excess that may require medical attention according to medieval beliefs:
And raise the humors within above the head of the staff, and make them to be in measure; so that their length is equal to two braces from the ground.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: A young strong lad commands that he shortens the thigh's head, and another boy is suspended above him by a rope; yet another youth supports his strength against them so quickly returns its joint back to position.
In the reduction itself, when it is dislocated from its place outside of the joint cavity, wherein the humors flow over the foot as recommended in the haptic gelatine; and his sinews are placed on top of the swolthy part properly and on the chest.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Each minister should extend his hand to their respective area, and the doctor uses his tongue for reduction according to art.
When dislocation occurs in the joints, it is said that these humors are drawn outwardly; and according to this treatment method, the doctor places his palm on top of the affected area for pressure while holding another hand over them as well, applying additional pressure at the location where they can extend. Here, a poultice or compress (implied by "langonar malaute") is applied with held hands and then maintained to exert continuous pressure in order to manage dislocation—by potentially drawing out any accumulated fluids causing inflammation while supporting proper alignment during the healing process:
If the dislocation is at the joints behind, do not let the humors spread to the parts immediately below and rise above the ground; there where they rest due to hard causes, as we have described concerning this patient' extran dimensions—and his face and ligaments are extended, just like what has been stated herein, he shall find no pain.
Where compression is applied using a table over the location where the joint has pain,
So when the reduction is complete as directed—and do not mistake this term for your efforts, extend thigh cushions from underneath them, and upon repeating those actions causing the patient's leg to contract further and expand their swelling area, understand that the corresponding limb returns; adjust hinges and pause empastre (likely referring to manual manipulation of structures), removing bands as wide so that none may become distended in any part. Secure the malady within repose for three or four days.
Return the sinew and bandage back into place, comparing one cushion with another.
And if you see those wounds in the bedridden state, know that the dislocation has already been closed, and hence let the humors go out of it now.
If you see any cause of suppuration (indicating infection or pus formation), then return and bandage that part according to your first application technique, and leave it for three days.
Return that part of it, and let him walk slowly on these stretthyers for as many days until he is comforted.
Given that this is an ancient text with potentially mixed linguistic elements from various
The phrase "Curacio de dislocacio del denolh" appears to be a medical term likely derived from Latin, where
The translation for "Curacio de dislocacio del denolh" into English is as follows:
The translation of the source sentence is as follows: "It is his name to command the humors that apply their cushion in the thigh, and you know well when he becomes dislocated.
And the restoration of all limbs is to straighten out (straightening) the malady directly, ensuring that your hand can span over it if possible; attach each foot's sole to their face, pause the leg between their feet, and apply pressure with your palms holding those areas. Meanwhile, another servant extends the patient’se limb within so as to return (the hernia or intestine) back into its natural place through strengthening it via leather straps held in hands; alongside this measure is taken for restoration of body parts and maintaining pressure until healing occurs.
When it is necessary for a person (he) that their cushion sticks in the area above his thighs, so as not to labor or exert himself unnecessarily.
And apply that and stick it to the couch at the thighs, and apply those same ones as bandages for three days or four, and take care of those things themselves.
No use the humoral fluid of walking for more than a few days until it is healed and comforted.
If your reduction of it is excused from you, then administer strong extension force on the ligaments which are described in its previous treatment for joint care.
In order to provide an accurate translation for "Capitol .xxxiii.,

The talus bone sometimes experiences slight displacement or is even completely dislocated; it may be due to injury at the joints (ligaments) or deeper within the foot structure itself, as indicated by this medieval text discussing fractures and potential treatment methods for a misaligned ankle. Here' extricating "Capitol .xxxiii." from its context:
When it is said that the patient's leg has been displaced, this means that their ankle has moved away from where it was originally positioned/dislocated.
May healing of the body be through light redistribution and is that it may spread easily within reach while remaining inside to return when needed.
When healing occurs according to the second complement of care, ensure that you straighten the hips and hold onto a strong servant from behind those two at this place in his body.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here the translation would be: Return your arm to your left for two times and extend it further with each repetition, ensuring that you hold onto your chest as much as possible during these movements.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Empowers the chest to its firm pillow tightly held, and you are in position for treatment.
Thus if he returns in a few days or two from this treatment, and when the foot is swolthy again, then all return to him for further operation as that one comes back.
May you be prohibited from reducing it if we have recommended some water for the patient'thy legs above ground; now unroll a firm mat on solid earth and wrap your cloak around them, thus preventing their legmaut (presumably referring to hernia or swelling) from coming out.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And the doctor loosens the dislocation at their joints, and another minister holds onto the healthy parts of the body until the dislocation returns to ease.
And when the dislocation is returned and it is declared to you that reduction has been achieved, then immobilize strongly with plaster or similar material those bound by their tendons, and bind the foot to these cushions/bandages firmly.
When you fear or protect the tendons behind which are located on the foot, to prevent that from being violent and leading it astray:
Return that for two or three days, and if the ligament softens, extend it outward.
Return that in the day or at night and forbid food for forty days. May it not happen that the detachment occurs there and becomes corrupted or decayed in this space, where treatment does not receive care.
If you apply poultice to the wound as we have described earlier in this account of treatment and care (in other places where healing takes place), let it be moistened with water that preceded our description here, so that it becomes softened for better absorption.

When someone is dislocated in their foot (the phrase "enguals" likely refers to limbs), a little extension can move it back into place if not too difficult—this action they attempt and may perform with some effort or skill involved ("leurger"). The translation attempts to preserve the meaning of urgent but potentially manageable first aid within this historical context.
If the dislocation is in a joint between two bones of the leg (the "duos del pes"), then you must straighten out or align what's referred to as 'malaute le sieu pe,' which implies realigning it, either on earth ground ("loc engual de la terra") such as lying down gently with an object like a board for stability and support (perhaps during the position of being flat on one’thy back or atop something stable), maintaining that posture where they were before injury occurred. The translation reflects basic emergency treatment advice from this historical medical
Hold the injured leg firmly but gently (indicating rest and support for immobilization), place your hand or another object over where you perceive pain along joint lines, ensuring that it's supporting what is below—this could be directly related to realigning a dislocated toe if visible. Once properly positioned with aid ("vertut entro"), check the leg again and ensure there are no signs of displacement or further injury (no appearance in prominence), suggesting an attempt at stabilization without causing additional harm, which aligns closely with contemporary first-aid immobilization techniques for dislocated toes.
