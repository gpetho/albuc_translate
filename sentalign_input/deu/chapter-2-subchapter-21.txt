Chapter XXI.
On the incision of the prominence of the uveal tunic.
When there is a disruption in the uveal tunic, and it protrudes and projects outside the eyelids like a grape, and distorts a person's appearance, and you want to cut it, the operation is as follows: you insert the needle at the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, then place another needle with a double thread at the lacrimal part, make it penetrate and leave the first needle in its position; then cut the place of the double thread and lift the part of the uvea around the needle, and tighten it firmly.
Then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye and leave it until the thread and the uvea fall off.
Then treat the eye with what strengthens it until the wound is healed.
Sometimes a large prominence forms in the eye and is attached all around with a circle of cloth, then it should be perforated with a fine instrument to come to the front of the eye, and let the white fluid flow, and the eye will descend and fit immediately.
Then tighten until it is healed.
