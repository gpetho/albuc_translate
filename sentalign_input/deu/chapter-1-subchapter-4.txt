Chapter Four:
On the Cauterization of Chronic Migraine
When you treat chronic migraine with the remedies we have previously described and those outlined in the sections on diseases, and if the treatment does not work, and you see that it is necessary to go beyond what was described in the initial cautery with medicine or cautery with fire, then you must ignite the cautery iron until it is white-hot. Mark the spot of the pain with a line about half the length of a finger, or nearly so; place your hand firmly once and press it until you cut through the skin and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary to avoid the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, and to ensure that the muscle is not burned and the nerve that controls it is not damaged, to prevent spasms.
And it is crucial to be cautious about the blood flow from the artery that may be cut, as there is fear in cutting it, especially for those who are inexperienced and not diligent or trained; leave the operation at that initial stage.
I will come back with a reminder about the management of accidental bleeding from the artery in its proper place in this book.
And if you see that this disease is not addressed by this cautery and the patient's body is strong enough, cauterize in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, use the cautery method mentioned in the chapter on arterial constriction with a cautery with two blades; this is a better and more effective cauterization.
