Be careful and vigilant about bleeding from the artery that you cut, as there is danger in cutting it, especially for those who are ignorant of what they are doing and have not been trained and experienced, and it is better to leave the procedure.	Have the utmost care of haemorrhage from the artery you have cut, for the occurrence of that is dangerous, specially with one who does not know what to do, having no experience or practice; it is better to refrain from operating.	0.85699457
The management of accidental bleeding from the artery will be mentioned in its place in the book, God willing.	We shall later on mention a treatment for accidental haemorrhage of the artery, in due detail, in its proper place in this book.	0.6437214
If you find that the ailment is not resolved by this cauterization and you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.	But if you see that this cautery is not enough for this disorder and you see that the patient is of bodily fitness for it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound till healed.	0.8194093
And if you wish, use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on dissecting the artery with the two-bladed cautery iron, for it is a better and more effective cauterization than this.	If you prefer, employ that cauterization which we have described in the chapter on the extraction of an artery, with the cautery of two blades; for that is a cauterization better and more effective than this.	0.8796979
