The author of this book, having completed for you, my children, this book, which is a complete part of medical knowledge, and having reached the summit of its clarity and explanation, saw fit to complete it for you with this chapter, which is a part of practical application.
Because practical application, in our country and in our time, is completely lacking, so much so that the study of its knowledge is almost lost and its effects have ceased. But only a few traces remain in the books of the ancients, which have been distorted by hands, affected by error and confusion, until their meanings have become obscure and their benefit distant.
Therefore, I saw fit to revive it and compose this chapter on the path of explanation, clarification, and summary, and to present illustrations of cauterizing irons and other instruments of practice, for it is an enhancement of clarity and a collection of necessities.
The reason there is no skillful craftsman with a skilled hand in our time is that the art of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first diligently study the anatomy, as described by Galen. So that he may understand the benefits of the organs, their arrangements, temperaments, connections, and separations, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers and exits, arteries, veins, both pulsating and stagnant, and the locations of their exits.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in practice, especially in the art of the hand.  We have mentioned a part of this in the introduction of this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have mentioned is prone to making mistakes that kill people, as I have frequently witnessed in those who imagine themselves knowledgeable in this science without knowledge or understanding.
I saw an ignorant physician lance a swine-like tumor on a woman's neck, severing some of the neck's arteries, and the woman bled to death in his hands.
I saw another physician, attempting to remove a stone from the bladder of an elderly man, a large stone. He acted rashly and removed it with a piece of the bladder itself. The man died about three days later.  I was called to remove the stone, and, having observed the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I considered it beyond my abilities.
I saw another physician who practiced medicine for hire among the merchants of our city.
A black boy, with a fracture near his heel and a wound, fell into the hands of this physician.  In his ignorance, the physician quickly bound the fracture tightly against the wound with splints and bandages, leaving no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he indulged his desires, and left him for days, ordering him not to loosen the bandages until his leg and foot swelled, and he was near death.
I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandages.  He found relief and his pain lessened, but the corruption had already set in the limb and I could not prevent it.
The corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
I saw another physician treat a cancerous tumor.  After a few days, it ulcerated, and the patient's suffering grew worse.  This is because if the cancer is purely of black humors, it should never be treated with iron.
Unless it is in a limb that can be completely removed.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two categories: work that is accompanied by safety, and work that, in most cases, results in harm.
I have warned in every place in this book of work that involves risk and fear, so you should avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant may not find a way to speak ill of you, be firm and cautious, and be gentle and steadfast in your treatment.
Employ the best path leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure diseases.
Free yourselves from that which you fear might introduce doubt into your religion and worldly affairs; it will be more lasting for your honour and will elevate your status in this world and the hereafter.
Galenus said in some of his advice: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you become a bad physician.
This treatise is divided into three chapters.
The first chapter.
In cauterization by fire and cauterization by sharp medicines, arranged from the foot to the head, illustrations of instruments, cauterization tools, and everything necessary for manual work.
And the second chapter.
Concerning incision, lancing, phlebotomy, cupping, surgeries, removal of arrows, and similar procedures, all arranged, and illustrations of instruments.
And the third chapter.
Concerning fractures, dislocations, treatment of sprains, and similar procedures, arranged from the head to the foot, and illustrations of instruments.
The first chapter.
Concerning cauterization.
Before mentioning its use, it is necessary to mention the benefits and harms of cauterization, and in which temperament it is used.
I say that discussing the benefits and harms of cauterization is a lengthy discourse, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and many wise men have spoken about it.
And they differed in their opinions, but I have concisely summarized their few words, fearing to become overly verbose.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for all bad temperaments, with or without material substance, excluding two temperaments: the hot temperament without substance, and the dry temperament without substance.
As for the dry temperament with material substance, they differed in opinion. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in it, while others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for diseases resulting from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured of a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry remedy.  The one who says the opposite claims that cauterization with fire may be beneficial for a hot, dry disease that arises in people's bodies. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the human body cold.
And I say with his opinion, because experience has shown me this repeatedly; however, one should not assume this matter without extensive training and practice in the art of cauterization. And he should understand the diversity of human temperaments, the nature of diseases themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for other temperaments, there is no fear of them, especially cold, moist diseases. All physicians agree on their benefit from cauterization.
Know, my children, that the secret of beneficial cauterization with fire lies in its superiority over cauterization with burning medicine. This is because fire is a single element whose effect is limited to the organ cauterized and it does not harm another connected organ except to a slight degree.
Cauterization with burning medicine may extend its effect to other organs, and may even cause a difficult-to-treat disease or death in the organ.  Fire, due to its nobility and the excellence of its essence, will not do this unless it is excessively applied.
This has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of our service, attention to the craft, and understanding of the facts.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse, though had it not been inappropriate for this book, I would have presented to you a profound secret concerning fire, and how it acts upon the body, and its power to dispel ailments using a philosophical and rigorous argument that might exceed your understanding.
Know, my children, that they have disagreed on the appropriate time for cauterization, and they consider spring to be the best time.
I say that cauterization may be appropriate in any season, because the harm caused by the season is absorbed by the benefit gained through cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for a strong, necessary affliction that cannot tolerate delay, lest it be followed by a greater calamity than the slight harm caused by the season.
Do not imagine, my children, what the common people and ignorant physicians suppose, that the cauterization which cures a disease will never return, and consider it a final remedy.
This is not as you suppose, for cauterization is like a medicine that changes the temperament and dries the moisture which is the cause of the afflictions.
However, cauterization is superior to medication in its swift success, strength of action, and severity of its power.
Yet the disease may return sometime in the future, according to the temperament of the patient, the strength of the disease, its power, and the accumulation of impurities in the body, and his negligence in acquiring proper foods, and similar causes.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild one, in a limb with little impurity and moisture. Like cauterizing a tooth to relieve pain, and similar cases, the pain may not return, and this is at least possible.
And as for the common saying that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, it is a correct statement, not in the way they believe, since they think that no treatment can be effective with or without medicine after cauterization, and the matter is otherwise.
The meaning of cauterization being the last resort in medicine is that if we have used various treatments for a disease and the medications have not been effective, and then cauterization is used last and it is effective, then this is why cauterization is called the last resort. Not in the sense understood by the common people and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients stated that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said this because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence.  They said that the cauterized area does not fester, but this is not universally true.
For I have tested this and found that it only works in some bodies, and not in others.  Cauterization with gold is better and superior to iron, as they said.  However, if you heat a gold cautery in the fire, you will not know when it has heated to the desired degree of gold's redness.
Because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase the heat in the fever, it melts in the fire and is ruined.  The craftsman is thereby engaged in work.  Therefore, cauterization with iron is quicker and closer to the correct procedure for use, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections, organized from head to foot, so that the student may easily find what he needs, God willing.
The first chapter.
Cauterization of the head, a single cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excess moisture and coldness in the brain, which are the cause of headaches, frequent colds from the head to the eye and ear area, excessive sleep, toothache, and sore throat. And in general, for every illness resulting from coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and stupor, and similar illnesses.
The method for this cauterization is that the patient should first be made to vomit with a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and usual condition.
Then you should command him to shave his head with a razor, then seat him before you in a squatting position with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes.  Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-oil cautery, which has this form.
If the bone is exposed to the extent of a needle head or a carbuncle seed, remove your hand. Otherwise, reheat the iron itself or another one, if it has cooled. Until you see the bone as I have described. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it, place it on the area, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in clarified butter and leave it on until the burning sensation from the fire subsides.  Then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals, God willing.
They have said that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it produces, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have suggested cauterizing the skin down to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the bone's thickness burns. Then the burned bone is subsequently scraped away and treated.
Others said that the cauterization should be vigorous, affecting the bone strongly until it falls away, like a small piece of charcoal or a small flake. They claimed that this releases vapors from the head from that location, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals.  I do not consider these two types of cauterization at all, except in some people and by way of a gamble.  I consider leaving it alone to be better.  With safety, if the head weakens when its natural connections are dispersed, as we have seen in other organs.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my view.  Use that one, and you will be safe, God willing.
Second Chapter.
On cauterizing the head also.
If a chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and this affliction lasts for the patient, and if applications, plasters, and flogging, ointments, and bandages have been used, especially if the single cauterization we described has been applied and nothing has helped, then look. If the patient's head is strong in constitution and not weak, and if he experiences severe cold, cauterize again a little above that first cauterization. Then cauterize each horn of his head with a cauterization until the thickness of the skin disappears and the amount of bone we described is revealed. And cauterize a cauterization at the back of his head, in the place known as the axe, and be gentle here; do not expose the bone, for the patient experiences intense pain, unlike the pain of all other head cauterizations.  I will mention this cauterization in its place.
The cautery used for the horns and back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used for the middle of the head. This is its image.
Chapter Three.
In cauterizing the chronic sister.
If pain occurs in the cleft of the head, accompanied by headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then the patient should be purged with medicines that cleanse the head, and use all the other treatments that I have described in the sections of diseases.  If this is not successful, then cauterization in this case is twofold. Either by cautery with a sharp, burning medicine, or by iron.
As for cautery with a burning medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends. Then, with a wide scalpel, open the painful area of the temple until there is a subcutaneous space large enough to accommodate the clove.
Place it under the skin until it disappears, then press it firmly and tightly with bandages for about fifteen hours. Then remove it and take out the garlic. Leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Apply a cotton swab dipped in clarified butter until the area becomes suppurative. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you wish, you can use some of the burning medicines I have mentioned in the eighteenth article on burning medicines.
And as for cauterizing with iron, do it in this way: heat the cautery iron, which is illustrated in this image:
The cautery iron is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head resembles a nail, with some grooves and a small protrusion in the center.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while slowly turning the iron, so that the amount of skin burned is about half its thickness. Then lift your hand so you do not burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding, then soak a cotton swab in salt water and apply it to the area, leaving it for three days. Then wrap the cotton with oil, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, cauterize this vein with the sharp tip of the cautery iron, preserving the vein from being cut, especially in chronic cases.
Fourth Chapter.
Treating chronic veins.
If you have treated the vein using the aforementioned treatment and what we have mentioned in the classifications of diseases, and the treatment does not work, and you see a cause that does not respond to the initial cauterization with medication or cauterization with fire. Then you should heat the sharp-tipped cautery iron until it glows white, after marking the site of pain with a line of about half a finger's length or similar, and you should withdraw your hand once, and applying force until you sever the artery and reach the bone.
However, you must be careful not to touch the moving jaw during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, causing spasm.
And be cautious and vigilant about the bleeding from the artery you cut, for there is risk in severing it. Especially if one does not know what to do and has not practiced the procedure, abandoning it is better.
The treatment of accidental arterial bleeding will be described in its appropriate place in this book, God willing.  If you see a condition this cauterization cannot manage,
And if you see the patient's condition as suitable, cauterize the center of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you prefer, use the cauterization mentioned in the chapter on arterial ligature with the double-bladed cautery; it is a better and more effective cauterization than this one.
Fifth chapter.
On cauterizing earaches.
If an earache occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other remedies mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, cauterize with the cautery called the point, which is pictured thus.
Then, after heating it, apply it around the entire ear, or around both ears if the pain is in both, as you would move it around. Keep the cauterization slightly away from the base of the ear after marking the area with ink.  The cauterization should be about ten points on each ear, or thereabouts. Then, treat the areas until healed, God willing.
Chapter Six.
In cauterization of the abscess.
The abscess treated by cauterization is the type that arises from phlegm, as I described in the classifications of diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve tension.
When you have treated this type of abscess with poultices, cupping, and gargles, and your treatment has been ineffective, then the affected area should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the cheekbone, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization should be performed with a cautery positioned opposite the upper part of the ear, slightly beneath the crown of the head, and another on the temple, its length being equal to the length of the thumb.
Apply the cautery until you have burned through about half the thickness of the skin.  This is the image of the cauterizing iron, a type of scalpel, similar to the previous image, but somewhat gentler, as you see. The knife should have a slight excess of thickness, then treat the affected area as previously described until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On the cauterization of chronic paralysis.
If the paralysis has become chronic and you have treated it as described, and your treatment is ineffective and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize four times. A cauterization on each temple, a cauterization in the middle of the head as we described, and a cauterization at the back of the head, as previously mentioned.
The cauterization method as previously mentioned, and a cauterization can also be applied to the mouth of the stomach, which is more effective. Then treat as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
The ailment caused by phlegm should first be treated by giving the patient large doses of purgatives and drugs that cleanse the brain.
Then his entire head is shaved, and a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on dressings, is applied repeatedly to his back.  This is a form of cauterization.
Follow the same procedure as mentioned there. If he recovers, leave it at that; otherwise, apply three cauterizations to the back of his head, arranged in a line from the top of the head to the base of the neck.
Place the distance of a finger's breadth between each cauterization.  Then treat the cauterizations as described above. If you wish to increase the treatment, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you wish to increase the treatment, cauterize the two horns. Then treat it until he is healed.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for paralysis and general body relaxation.
You should first cleanse the head with the procedures we have mentioned, then shave the patient's head and cauterize a burn in the center of the head, a burn on each horn of the head, and a burn on the back of the head.
And three on the cervical vertebrae. If, in a case of body relaxation, more than that is needed, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is strong and entrenched, then cauterize four burns on the vertebrae of his back. And cauterize deeply, until most of the skin is burned, then lift your hand, and treat it as previously mentioned, until he is healed, God willing.  The cautery should be olive-oil based.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterization for epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is due to phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be cleansed with large leeches and with all the other treatments we mentioned in the classification, if the patient is large and able to take medication.
However, if it is a child who cannot tolerate medication, then gargles and mouthwashes that cleanse the brain should be used many days beforehand, along with improving their diet.
Then his head is shaved, and one cauterization is applied in the middle of the head, as described before, and another in its back. And on each horn of his head, a cauterization. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, apply the cauterizations mentioned for stroke and relaxation of the body on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is putrid moisture and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauterizations we mentioned for stroke.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess leaning towards black bile and the patient's body is moist and putrid, purge what cleanses the brain as previously described in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of linen like a circle, and place it in the center of his head. The patient sits crouched, holding onto it from each side. Then take one pound of old sheep's butter.
Then heat it over the fire to a moderate heat that the finger can tolerate if inserted into it, then pour it into the circle in the center of his head and let it cool. Do this to the patient once a week, along with good general treatment, until he recovers, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small, scattered dots, without holding the cautery in your hand, but rather with a puffing motion. This type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a linen cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat to it.
The twelfth chapter.
On cauterizing the water flowing from the eye.
If you observe the water flowing from the eye initially with the signs described in the classification, then immediately apply remedies to cleanse the head and protect it from all moisture.  Have him sweat in a bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize the middle of the head, and cauterize the temples twice if the water is flowing from both eyes or from one side if it is from one eye only.
Then, with the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin, and the cauterizations should be lengthwise and across the temples, while guarding against blood loss.
If you see something of it, cut it at the location with any possible treatment, and we will come to the wisdom regarding the ligation and cutting of arteries and the prevention of bleeding.
He may also be cauterized twice vigorously at the base of the skull, below the bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic weeping.
If the weeping of the eyes is chronic and persistent, and it is known to originate from the veins and arteries located on the surface of the head, exterior to the skull, and you are certain that it is due to thick, cold, phlegmatic excess, cauterize it with the cauterization that I have described specifically at the start of the descending water. A cauterization in the center of the head, and two cauterizations on each temple, and two cauterizations at the base of the skull, beneath the bones.  If further cauterization is required, cauterize on each side of the eye's socket, on the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing a foul-smelling nose.
If treatment with what we have previously mentioned in the classification proves ineffective, immediately bleed the patient from the temples three nights in a row, then shave his head and cauterize the center with an olive-oil cautery iron. Then cauterize with a nail-shaped cautery iron, two cauterizations above the eyebrows, slightly under the hair, keeping away from the artery, do not cut it.  This is the image of the nail-shaped cautery iron.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid is relaxed due to disease or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize above the eyebrows slightly, two cauterizations on each side, keeping a distance from the temples, and the length of each cauterization should be the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cauterization, but only to the point where one-third of the skin is burned, and the shape of the cautery iron should be like this.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its lashes turn inward, damaging the eye, then there are two types of cauterization for it. Either cauterization by fire or cauterization by a burning medicine.  If cauterization by fire, instruct the patient beforehand to allow his lashes to grow long and even, if he is one who plucks them.
If he injured it while they were growing, bind his eyes with a bandage so they won't move until they grow.  Once they have grown long and even, place the patient's head on your lap. Then, mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of an as-leaf.
Begin the mark near the eyelashes. Then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a badger under the eyelid. Then heat a cautery iron—this is its image.
Then cauterize it in the shape you marked, little by little, many times until the surface of the skin, which is completely visible in the shape of an as-leaf, is burnt.  A sign of your successful work is to see the eyelid pulled tight and the hair raised from the eye's flesh.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days. Then apply a cotton swab with ghee until the scab comes off. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If any hair grows back later and the eyelid relaxes,
Then repeat the cauterization at that spot as you did first.  If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with the burning medicine, tell the patient to leave the eyelashes to grow long and even.
Then make a picture of an as-leaf from paper. Then take from the usual soap and quicklime, each one a weight of a dirham or similar, and grind them thoroughly. Do this quickly so they do not dry. Then spread some of it on the paper, shaped like an as-leaf, and place it on the one or both eyelids. Place a cotton swab soaked in egg white under the eye, and place the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on the medicine and gently press it while moving it whenever the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, because it feels like fire.  As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine, moving it with your finger.  When the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And see if you see the eyelid has risen, as it rises when cauterized with fire or by cutting. If not, apply more of the medicine to the area where it hasn't taken effect and hasn't blackened, until you complete your work and the eye is cauterized. Then place cotton with oil on it to remove the burning sensation.
Then treat it with palm ointment or another, until it heals.  You must be extremely careful during the procedure to prevent any of the medicine from entering the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after a few days, and you fear something in the eye,
Then reapply the medicine to that relaxed area of the eyelid, specifically as you did before, and treat it until it heals. This is an image of an as-leaf.
Know that people's eyes vary in size and age.  Therefore, adjust your cauterization accordingly.  The correct method is evident to those skilled in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the tumor that appears in the eye's corner.
If you treated the tumor as described in the sections on diseases, and your treatment was unsuccessful, then it is necessary to cauterize it in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head in your lap, and have an attendant hold his head firmly, without movement or shaking.
Then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or in the juice of a certain plant on his eyes, then heat the cautery iron, which is pictured here.
It should be hollow, shaped like a bird of prey's feather tube, on the cauterizing end.  If you wish, make the other end pierced, or if you wish, solid like a rod. However, the hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then, squeeze the tumor if it is open, and remove the matter from it and dry it, or if it is not open, then open it and remove its pus. Then, apply the intensely hot cautery to it, holding it with your hand until you reach the bone.
Keep your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing, so that your hand does not miss the mark or the patient becomes agitated, and the cautery falls on the eyelid and damages it.  If you reach the bone on the first application, otherwise, reheat the cautery a second time if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball soaked in ghee and treat it with a dry ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, apply the caustic, strong medicine until the bone is exposed and treat it as described in the relevant section, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing the tumor, mentioned by some of the ancients, is to carefully incise the tumor and then place a thin funnel within the incision.  This is its image.
Pour into it an amount of molten lead equal to the weight of a dirham.  Hold the funnel firmly in your hand, and the patient must remain completely still so that the molten lead does not drip into their eye.  A cotton ball soaked in egg white or water should be placed over the patient's eye.
The lead will burn the tumor and cure it remarkably.  If the tumor heals with the cauterization and treatment mentioned, then no further action is needed. If not, it will be necessary to use nasal perforation and return the tumor to the nasal passage, as will be detailed in the specific section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing cleft lip.
A cleft in the lip, often called a fissure, frequently occurs, especially in the lips of young boys. If the cleft is treated as described in the section, but the treatment is ineffective, a small, knife-like cautery iron should be heated and applied in this manner.
Its cavity should be as thin as a knife, and then it should be placed hot and quickly in the same cleft until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft.  Then treat it with qirrot (a type of medicinal plaster) until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing a fistula in the mouth.
If a tumor appears on the gum, palate, or roots of the teeth, then ulcerates and bursts, forming a fistula from the discharge of pus, and treatment proves ineffective, then a cautery iron should be heated to fit the size of the fistula.
Then, insert it hot into the fistula's opening, holding it until the heated iron reaches its deepest part. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterward as previously described until it heals, God willing.
If the material is cut off and healed, well and good. Otherwise, the area must be examined and the diseased bone removed, as will be described in its section, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Loose teeth and gums.
If the gums have loosened due to moisture, and the teeth have moved, and remedies have failed, then place the patient's head on your lap and heat the cautery iron, its image to come later, after placing the tube onto the tooth.
Quickly insert the hot cautery iron, and hold your hand for a short while until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth, then remove your hand. Then, repeat the cautery as desired, after which the patient should fill their mouth with salt water.
He should hold it for an hour and then spit it out.  The loose tooth will be stabilized, the relaxed gums will tighten, and the bad moisture will dry.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold or worms, and medication is ineffective, cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with oil or with fire.
For cauterization with oil, take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or a shell.  Then take a cotton ball, wrap it around the end of a rod, dip it into the hot butter, and place it on the aching tooth quickly.  Hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  Alternatively, if you wish, dip wool or cotton in cold butter, place it on the aching tooth, and put the heated iron on top until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterizing with fire, use a brass or iron tube, slightly thick-walled to prevent the heat from reaching the patient's mouth.  Then heat the appropriate cautery iron, place it on the same tooth, and hold it until the iron cools. Repeat this several times.
The pain will cease either that same day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out. This is a depiction of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you prefer, according to what is possible.  This is a depiction of the tube.
The Twenty-second Chapter.
On cauterizing swine.
If the swine are affected by phlegm and cold humors, and do not respond to ripening with medication, and you desire rapid ripening, then heat the hollow cautery, the image of which is shown with both ends pierced.
To allow smoke to emerge from the opposite end during the cauterization, place the protected cautery on the same tumor once, and again if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, adjust the cautery to fit the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton ball dipped in clarified butter until what was burned by the fire disappears, then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-three.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humidity predominates in the trachea, especially if the temperament is cold, the patient should first be purged with laxative medicines, then cauterized with a cautery on the neck, at the base of the throat, in the lower position.
Be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, and only burn half of the skin.  Then cauterize again at the joint of the neck, at the end of the last bead, intensely.  Let the cautery be a nail-shaped one, as described before.
Then treat him with what was previously mentioned until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In cauterizing lung disease and coughs.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture, and there is no fever or consumption in the patient, and the illness is chronic, cauterize twice above the collarbones, in the soft, hollow, lower areas, and once more in the center of the chest between the breasts.
And the cautery should be pointed, as described previously.  If you prefer, your cauterization can be done with a drop cautery, the one called the "point," a description of which is provided in the section on treating earache.  The number of points should be from thirty to approximately that amount.
Then treat him with what was previously mentioned until he is healed.  You may also use a cautery with three branches, in this manner.  Using this, cauterize more quickly because you cauterize three times in one application.  This is a depiction of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus has dislocated due to slippery moisture, or if it was not properly repositioned when reducing the dislocation, so that it habitually dislocates again and dislocates at the slightest movement, as we have observed, then the joint must first be reduced. Then the patient lies on their back or on their right side.  Then the skin inside the armpit is raised upwards by the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inwards.
Then heat the double-pronged cautery, which is pictured here.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side.  The form of the cauterization is four cauterizations. It may be cauterized with a three-pronged cautery; in that case, the form of the cauterization will be six cauterizations, and the prongs are on the surface of the wound.
And this is the image of the three-pronged cautery.
One more may be added to this number, making the cauterizations eight. Then, apply the crushed balls mixed with salt to the cauterization.  Then the patient should be kept at rest and not move the limb for a time until it strengthens. If the dislocation was upward, that rarely happens.
Cauterize above the shoulder with one good, nail-like cauterization, or with many small cauterizations; then the joint will strengthen, the moisture will disappear, and the patient will be cured.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In cauterizing the stomach.
If a cold and excessive moisture develops in the stomach, causing its temperament to be disrupted, and frequent discharges occur, and various treatments have been ineffective, then the patient should lie on their back, extend their legs and arms, and then be cauterized three times. Cauterize below the breastbone to the extent of a finger using a nail-like cauterizing iron, and cauterize two more points below, each one at the sides of the initial cauterization, so that the cauterizations form a triangle.  Keep them apart so that they do not unite if they become suppurated. The depth of the cauterizations should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin. The shape of the cauterizations should be [as described].
In this form and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a single large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cauterizing iron used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, in this manner.
The stomach can also be cauterized by pricking, for those who are hesitant about this cauterization.  Mark the stomach with dots to the desired extent with ink, then cauterize the dots with a pointed cauterizing iron. Then treat it with the aforementioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If the liver presents pain due to coldness and dampness, or due to a boiling wind, such that it has departed from its natural disposition to an excessive degree, and the patient has been treated as described in the classification, yet this has not been effective. Then the patient should lie on their back, and three cauteries should be applied with ink to the liver, in this shape and this exact amount, below the clavicles, where the human forearm ends.
And after each cautery, there should be a space equal to the thickness of a finger.  The cauterization should be done along the body in a straight line, and do not press the cautery tool too forcefully.
The amount of skin burned should be about half its thickness, no more.  The patient should stand on their feet; if they cannot stand, they should lie down with their legs extended and arms raised.  This is the shape of the cautery tool.
You may perform these cauteries with a knife-like cautery tool if you have skill and dexterity in the craft, and take precautions to avoid over-cauterizing, burning the entire skin, burning the abdomen, and reaching the intestines. The skin there is thin, so be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cauterizing a liver tumor.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know if the tumor is in the liver's flesh or its lining, if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient will experience heaviness and pain, but without sharpness.
If it is in the liver's lining, the pain will be sharp and intense.  And if the physicians have exhausted treatment options, the patient should lie on their back, and then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then, heat the cautery iron in the fire; it is a cautery iron resembling a spatula. This is its image. Cauterize with a single cautery until the entire skin is burned and the cauterization reaches the lining, so that all the matter comes out.  Then treat it with an abscess treatment until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be used by those whose knowledge of medicine is extensive and who have treated these illnesses repeatedly by experience.  Only then should they undertake such a procedure; otherwise, abandoning it is preferable.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients recommended cauterizing cold fistulas with the roots of the zuraund plant in this manner:  Take a single, longest, dried zuraund root, as thick as a finger.  Then dip it in oil and hold it in the fire. Then cauterize once between the collarbone and the neck, and two small cauterizations slightly below the veins, angled toward the area under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, angled slightly backward; another in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach; and three cauterizations from behind, one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the lower back, below the cauterization made between the shoulder blades.
One should not deeply cauterize, but rather cauterize superficially, on the surface of the skin. Some of the ancients have mentioned that some people used a heated iron tool, similar to a spear, and heated it then inserted it between the ribs until it reached the tumor.
The pus will come out, as we have mentioned in cases of liver tumors.  In this condition, cauterization carries the risk of the patient dying immediately or, alternatively, causing an incurable fistula at the site.
Chapter Thirty.
Cauterization of the spleen.
If, after treating the spleen as described in the classification, your treatment is unsuccessful, then cauterization can be done in three ways, all correct: one is to cauterize three or four times, aligned along the length of the spleen.
In the shape of liver cauterizations, previously described, with a space between each cauterization equal to or slightly exceeding the thickness of a finger.  The cautery iron should be applied as described for liver cauterization; do not insert your hand deep with the cauterization. The patient should lie on their back.
The other method is at the elbow.  Lift the skin opposite the spleen, where the patient's left elbow ends.  Raise the skin across the width of the body, so that the cauterizations are aligned along the body.
Then, carefully introduce the probes until they pierce the skin on the other side, then withdraw the cautery iron.  The cauterizations will be four.  If desired, use the other cautery iron with three points.
Then treat the cauterized area after allowing it to discharge pus for many days; this is more effective than any other previous treatment.
Chapter Thirty-one.
Concerning cauterization for dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in ascites, specifically.  If, after treating the dropsy patient with the methods of treatment we previously described in the classification, your treatment has been ineffective, then you should cauterize four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, and one on the spleen.  Two cauterizations behind his back, one opposite his chest and the other opposite his stomach.  The depth of the cauterization should be nearly the thickness of the skin. Then leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
Do not discontinue treatment of the patient after the cauterization, but apply what is necessary to bring together the affected areas.  This will speed recovery. The shape of the cautery used for the back is, as previously described, nail-shaped, and the one used for the front is olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot at the point between the little finger and the ring finger.
Hold your hand with the cautery straight, do not bend it. Then lift your hand and do not return it; this will cause the yellow water to drain.  The cautery should be of this shape.
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg.  The cauterization should be with the sharp tip of the cautery.  Make one cauterization along the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than that, towards the middle of the leg. On each thigh, make two cauterizations.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so that the water drains from it, then treat it with the other methods mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and dampness, weakening the digestive and binding forces in the stomach and intestines, and if various treatments have been ineffective, and you see the patient is strong enough to endure the cauterization, then cauterize a large area on their stomach. As previously mentioned, cauterize the stomach with a circular cautery, and make four cauterizations around the navel with a fine pointed cautery. Make one or two large cauterizations on the lumbar region above the coccyx.
If you see a significant amount of dampness, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the pubic region, and one cauterization on each hip.  Possibly add two small cauterizations to the stomach near the large one. This is a successful and unfailing treatment, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If the anus has numerous chronic hemorrhoids, or a single one, composed of thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and the treatment mentioned in the previous section has been unsuccessful, cauterize the patient three times on the lower part of the lumbar spine, slightly below the table, in a triangular pattern.
And cauterize below the navel by the length of two fingers.  If you suspect the patient's stomach is cold and food is not digesting, and you see the face swollen, cauterize the stomach with a large cauterization as previously described and cauterize the liver. And another on the spleen with a pointed cautery. Leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery, which resembles an awl, and insert it hot into the same cut wart, and press your hand until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as described, then treat them with ointments that are suitable for them until they are healed. If you cauterize a large area on the cotton, it is more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula that occurs in the perineum and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the treatment described in its place and avoids it, perhaps the cautery will heal him. If a fistula occurs in someone and it is chronic, pus and corrupt humors flow from it, then the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then, determine the depth of its penetration with the probe, then heat the cautery iron, which resembles a needle, and insert it hot into the same fistula along the direction and depth where the probe entered.  Repeat the cauterization until all the corrupt bodies are burnt, once, twice, or thrice, as needed.
And be cautious of burning a nerve, if one exists, or a large vein, if the fistula opens into the bladder or the intestines.
And be cautious of all these locations.  Only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge it to be non-penetrative.  Then treat the area until it heals. If the area heals, the material stops and it remains like that for some time, know that it has healed completely.
If the material does not stop flowing, know that it is penetrating or has a corrupt bone in its depth, or something similar to that which will be mentioned in its proper place.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's ejaculate decreases as a result, one should cauterize the loins, on the kidneys themselves. Cauterize each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery, which was previously mentioned.  Perhaps we cauterize it a third time in the same area.  This results in three aligned cauterizations, which will be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, cauterize with one cautery below the navel, on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and another cautery to the right of the navel, and another to the left.
After each cautery on either side, cauterize to the size of a thumb's breadth, and cauterize once or twice more on the lower back if needed.  Use a nail-shaped cautery, as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If the uterus contains a material of cold and dampness, preventing conception, corrupting her menstrual flow, and making her unable to urinate or causing pain at the time of menstruation, then three cauteries should be applied around the navel, as was described in the cauterization of the bladder. One cautery on the lower back, near the lumbar region, or two, using a nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Incorrect humors may accumulate in the hip joint, causing dislocation.  A sign is that one leg will be longer than the other when the legs are compared.  A space will be found where the hip is dislocated.  It is necessary to cauterize the affected area on the hip joint itself with a nearly circular cautery.
After marking the area around the joint, as if to draw a circle, place the affected joint in the center of the circle.  Use the cautery illustrated in the treatment of the stomach. If this cautery is unavailable, use three cauterizations with the large olive cautery.
Make the cauterization deep enough to encompass the entire thickness of the skin.  Then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-one.
In cauterizing the sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and dampness, and treatment according to our previous classification has been ineffective and prolonged, it is necessary to loosen the thick humors with rotten seeds or prickly pear seeds, and similar remedies.
Then cauterize.  The cauterization has two forms: either with burning medicines or with fire.  Cauterization with fire can be done in many ways.  One is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
And it will create a beneficial depth. The interval between each cauterization should be the thickness of a finger. The cautery should be olive-shaped.  One may also cauterize the very top of the hip joint itself with a single cauterization in the center, resulting in four cauterizations in total. Or, if you wish, you can cauterize it with the circular cautery previously mentioned for hip dislocation, applying a single cauterization.
So that the circle encompasses the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica, if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize twice on the thigh, at the location where the patient indicates the pain. Cauterize once above the heel, a little to the outer side, with four fingers' distance.  The cautery should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
And if he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize at the indicated location with a pinpoint cautery, three or four times, or more if needed. If he points to the pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize once with a knife-shaped cautery there.
In all your cauterizations, be careful not to cauterize a nerve or major artery, as this would inflict a serious injury or ailment on the patient.
I have witnessed two cases where a cauterization was performed above the heel, with excessive cauterization resulting in gangrene extending to the foot, causing its complete perforation and the destruction of the entire leg.  Subsequently, diarrhea and death followed.  If the pain is in both areas, cauterize them in the same manner.
Some wise scholars have described a cauterization of the hip using a cautery in the shape of a cup, made of iron, with a diameter of half a span. The rim of the cup should be as thick as a date pit, or slightly thinner. Within this cup is another cup, and a third.
The cups are spaced apart by the width of a thumb's circumference.  The cups are open on both sides and are about one or two thumbs in height.  A handle of iron is securely attached to the cups.  This is its design.
Then, it is heated in the fire until it glows red and sparks fly.  It is then placed on the affected hip area, with the patient resting on their right side. Three circular cauterizations are performed at once.  The patient is then left for three days, bandaged with ghee, and the wound is left open for several days.
Many more (cauterizations) are then performed with ointment until healing occurs. The author of this book states that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its unpleasantness and frightening appearance, and few can endure it.  However, it is a good cauterization for those who can endure it and are affected in its location.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, it is done by making two cups resembling the rings into which the door hinges are fitted, either of copper or iron.
Their height will be approximately two thumbs, and the space between them will be the thickness of a finger.  The lower and upper parts will be open, with the cups held together in this manner.
Then, place them on the affected hip area with the patient lying on their right side.  Hold your hand gently. Then, pour a small amount of sharp water heated with fire between the circles.  Hold it for the time it takes a sandglass. The patient will endure the stinging and burning, as it will feel like fire.
Until the stinging subsides. Then, remove the instrument and wash the entire hip with fresh water. Leave it for three days and apply ghee until the burn's blackness disappears. Then leave it for several days to drain the pus, as it is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.  If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it, containing water, in the same manner as for the hip. This is the description of sharp water.  Its efficacy has been demonstrated in my treatise on the preparation of remedies.
Take one part each of lye and quicklime.  Grind them together and place them in a new pot with a single small hole at the bottom, large enough for a rod to enter.  Place another glazed pot underneath the base of the first pot.
Pour fresh water over the lye and lime to cover them by a finger's breadth after gently pressing them with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water runs into the lower glazed pot. Then, collect all the water and pour it over fresh lime and lye.
It will then be very potent, effective in many medical procedures and in cauterizing other limbs, because it acts like fire itself.  Some remedies also cauterize the hip, such as *thaafsia*, *baladhri* honey, and lime mixed with soap, all ground into a paste.
Galen, recounting a treatment from an ancient physician for hip and sciatica pain, greatly praised it, claiming that it needed no other treatment and cured in a single application.
Indeed, it is said that a person might enter the bath carried and emerge cured, by taking fresh green *shiṭraj* (or, if unavailable, fresh dry *shiṭraj*), finely grinding it with some fat and applying it to the hip, leg or thigh where the pain is.
Apply the dressing and leave it on for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning subside. Then have him enter a bath. Once his body is moist, place him in a basin.  The pain will subside and he will be healed, God willing. If he is not healed, reapply the dressing after ten days.
He will be healed, God willing.  Know that no one should use these cauterizing remedies until the body has been emptied. Dioscorides mentioned that goat's hair, when used to cauterize sciatica, is helpful.
The cauterization should be done like this: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep area between the thumb and the elbow, closer to the elbow.  Then take dry goat's hair.
Ignite it with fire until it becomes embers, then place it on the wool and leave it until it dies out.  Repeat this until sensation reaches from the middle of the upper arm to the hip and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called cauterization with hair.
Chapter Forty-two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Back pain may arise from various causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like.  It may result from the effusion of cold, damp matter.  Cauterization is only effective in this type of case.
Following the patient's vomiting, with medicines like rotten herbs, the back should be cauterized where the pain is located.  Three rows should be made, equal to the width of the table.  Five cauterizations, or more, should be made in each row, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength, after marking the area with ink.
The cauterization should be performed with a pointed cautery.  Alternatively, three or four cauterizations with a medium-sized nail cautery may be performed in this way.
Chapter Forty-three.
In cauterizing the initial stage of the swelling.
This ailment often affects young children.  A sign of its initial stage in a child is shortness of breath when standing or moving, and at the end of the spine's vertebrae, a pearl-like prominence appears, protruding above the other vertebrae.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery of this design. Apply the cautery evenly to each side of the vertebra.  If desired, cauterize around the vertebra with a pinpoint cautery in two or three rows, keeping the points close together.  Then treat the area until healed, as described.
And be mindful that cautery should be used for swellings that are due to nerve spasms.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pain.
If joint pain is due to cold dampness flowing to any part of the body, and if the pain occurs in the legs, physicians customarily call it gout, especially.
If the cold gout, its cause, is treated with the methods we have described in the classification, and the pain does not subside, cauterization will relieve it.  This is done by cauterizing the area around the joints of the legs with many cauteries after emesis. The cautery should be olive-oil based, of medium heat, in this manner.
If it is necessary to apply points on the leg, use the pointed cautery.  If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, as often happens, cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries on each side, using the same olive-oil cautery.
If more cauterization is required, cauterize, but do not go deep with the cautery; it should only be to the thickness of the skin. If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the cauterization mentioned in its section.
If the pain is only in the hands, apply points around the elbows in two rows. If the pain persists in the fingers, apply a point to each knuckle and to the palm. If, after a few days, the pain ascends to the forearms or shoulders,
Cauterize both sides.  The patient must also follow good treatment and take medicine.  If he/she improves their diet and expels phlegm, he/she will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some of the intestines and bowels descend into the testicle, and this is a recent occurrence, the patient should be instructed to abstain from eating that day and use laxatives to evacuate his bowels.
Then, the patient should lie on his back before you, and you should instruct him to restrain himself until the bowels or intestines protrude.  Then, you should return them with your finger, and then mark the area under the hernia on the pubic bone with ink, a mark resembling a semicircle, its ends towards the upper body.
Then, heat a cauterizing iron, this is its form.
Until it becomes white and throws sparks.  Then, return the bowels or intestines to their place inside him.  Then, have a servant place his hand on the area so that the bowels do not protrude again.  Support the patient's legs apart and place a cushion underneath.  Another servant should hold the legs together.
And another on his chest, holding his hands.  Then, place the cauterizing iron on the same mark, with your hand holding the iron straight up.  Hold it until it reaches the bone or apply it again if it did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
Be careful to prevent the bowels from protruding while you cauterize, so as not to burn the patient, which may cause either death or a serious injury.  Understand that if the cauterization does not reach the bone, your treatment will not be successful.  The cauterizing iron should be appropriate for the patient's age, i.e., gentler for children and more robust for adults.
Then, treat the cauterized area with oil after three days to remove the burnt marks.  Then, treat it with other ointments until it heals.  The patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound is completely closed.
His diet during treatment should be such as to soften his bowels, so that the bowels do not protrude during bowel movements.  After forty days, if he wishes to stand, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.  He should reduce exertion, overeating, and excessive drinking and loud noise.
If he follows this procedure, he will be completely healed, God willing.  I will discuss the treatment of hernias by incision in its proper chapter, God willing.  As for a hernia that occurs anywhere on the abdomen and is just beginning, if you want to prevent it from increasing, cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery that fits its size. Burn approximately a third of the skin. Then treat it as described; it will not worsen, God willing. Some earlier physicians have suggested cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After drawing a line with ink, the line should be at the top of the hernia and another line at the bottom, with your hand going down the center with one single, pointed cautery. The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If, in some part of the body, a fall or blow causes pain that persists for a long time and is not relieved by medication, it is necessary to cauterize with a pinpoint cautery. The cauterization of each part of the body should be in accordance with its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And if the pain and fistula are alleviated, then the patient will be cured from the first cauterization.  Otherwise, repeat the cauterization, for it is the nature of these pains to spread from one part to the parts nearby.  Thus, it is necessary to follow up with cauterization until the patient recovers.
Chapter Forty-seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for those afflicted with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that results from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize him, observe.  If the leprosy is in its initial stage, and you have treated it as described in the division, and it has not deteriorated or stopped, and you fear that corruption will take hold of all the patient's humours, cauterize the head five times. The first in the usual center of the head, the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one from behind on the base of the neck.  Apply the cauterization thoroughly until it affects the bone slightly.
And scabs will peel off, making it easier for thick vapors to escape.  Cauterize the spleen as described previously.  However, if the leprosy has persisted and become clearly apparent, then these cauterizations on the head, which we have described, should be applied. One cauterization on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the tail, another above it in the same area, and two on each thigh, one on each hip. Two on each knee, one on each knee, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the ribs, and cauterize each joint of the fingers and toes, a cauterization on each heel and each wrist.
And protect the nerve behind the heels so that you do not burn them.  A cauterization may be applied to the pubic bone, another to the opening of the stomach, and another to the liver.  Know that the more cauterizations you apply, the more beneficial and effective they will be.
Know that the patient feels less pain from the cauterizations than a healthy person, because their body is numb.  The cauteries should be of varying sizes, depending on the organs and joints, according to the characteristics of the irons described previously.
Then treat the cauterization with fine carob powder and honey, and with other remedies, until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Forty-eight.
Concerning cauterization of numb areas: If a part of the body is numb and treated with medications, ointments, and dressings, but does not heal, cauterize the same numb area with cauteries, according to the size of the affected part of the body.  Let your cauteries be slightly smaller than the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  Sometimes, cauterization is used for the numbness that occurs in the hand or foot due to spinal problems at the point where the nerve that moves that limb exits, and this will remove the numbness.
Only those knowledgeable about the anatomy of the organs and the points of exit of the nerves that move the body should undertake this.
Chapter Forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of leprosy.
If leprosy persists and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it with a slight depth, proportionate to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and the color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil, and the leaves of the common mullein, pigeon blood, or the blood of hookbills, one part of each. Mix everything together, apply to a cloth, and bandage the area until healed.
Chapter Fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop its progress, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.  Some scholars have suggested a severe cauterization in the middle, but I do not recommend that, for I fear it will ulcerate, and I have witnessed this on several occasions.
Therefore, the correct method is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we mentioned, or with many small cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On the cauterization of the abscess.
If an abscess occurs and is slow to mature, either because of the agent causing it, or the age of the patient (if elderly and with little blood), or due to time, and you wish to hasten its maturation, cauterize around it with many small, dotted cauterizations.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.  If you wish to apply further cauterization, heat the cauterizing iron which is depicted as follows.
Lower it into the center of the abscess until it penetrates the skin.  Let the cauterization be situated below, so that the discharge of pus is easier. Then treat it appropriately until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On cauterizing ulcers.
Ulcers are nothing but corruption that spreads throughout the organ, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place where cauterization with fire is appropriate, heat a cauterizing iron with many small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place where the ulcer is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing remains of it at all.  Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas, so that all the scabs and all corruption are removed.
Then treat it with healing ointments.  If after three days you see that the flesh grows healthily, without any corruption, then leave it alone. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupt areas. Ulcers can also be treated with strong medicine.
For it acts as a substitute for fire, with faster benefits.  I have mentioned its treatment with strong medicine in the division.  So take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On cauterizing impacted and non-impacted nails.
This affliction often occurs on the soles of the feet; it is a rough and painful condition.  Cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with fire or with strong caustic water.
As for cauterization by fire, heat a hollowed-out cauterizing iron, similar to an eagle's feather, crafted from iron, to completely encircle the nail.  Its border should be thin.  Then lower it, heated, onto the nail, and rotate your hand with the cauterizing iron around the nail until the iron reaches the nail's depth.
Leave it for three days to produce pus. Then, bandage it with crushed wild herbs mixed with salt. Leave the bandage on overnight.  The nail will then detach from its roots.  Then treat the wound with a healing ointment until it heals; this is for non-impacted nails.
It often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet.  Thus, one should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's feather and apply it to the nail or wart.  Then pour a small amount of strong caustic water into the tube.
Hold the tube, rotating it while gently pressing your hand so the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail and the caustic water penetrates to the root of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging sensation of the caustic water for a short while.
Then leave it; the nail will detach from its roots.  Do this with each one until all such occurrences on the body are addressed.  Then treat the affected areas with healing ointments after the detachment.
Chapter Forty-five.
On cauterizing the inflamed.
If an inflammation occurs due to cold in the nerve, or from a fever, or otherwise, it is necessary to cauterize four or five times on the back, with a cauterization between each bead, and a cauterization on the chest. And cauterize his stomach with an olive oil cautery, for the inflammation will subside and hasten the maturation of the cold disease.
Chapter Fifty-five.
On cauterizing a wound that has arisen in the body.
Ugly boils may arise in the body due to thick, corrupted cold materials.  Upon their first appearance, a gentle cauterization should be applied to the head of each boil using a heated stick or the long root of a plant or a lens-shaped cautery.
Boils, in their initial emergence, may be cauterized in this manner.  Thus, the active cause of the boil will not increase, but will dissipate, and the patient will recover.  However, this should only be done after the patient has been bled.
Chapter Fifty-six.
On cauterizing bleeding from a severed artery.
Bleeding often occurs from a severed artery in a wound from the outside, or when a tumor or organ is incised or cauterized, and similar cases.  It is often difficult to stop.
If this occurs, quickly place your index finger over the opening of the artery, gently pressing to constrict the blood beneath your finger, so that nothing escapes.  Then, take several small and large olive-oil cauterizing irons and heat them intensely in the fire.
Then, take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery has ruptured, and apply the cauterizing iron to the same vein after quickly removing your finger.  Hold the cauterizing iron until the bleeding stops.
If the blood spurts out when you remove your finger from the artery opening, and if the cauterizing iron has cooled, quickly take another cauterizing iron from the heated ones and continue to use one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn the nerve, for this would cause additional suffering to the patient.  Know that if an artery is bleeding, it cannot be severed, especially a large one, except by one of four methods: either cauterization, as we have said, or amputation if it has not already been severed. If it is severed, the ends will contract and the bleeding will stop.  Alternatively, it can be tied tightly with threads, or medicaments that can stop the bleeding and firmly compress the area can be applied.
As for those who attempt to stop it by tying, compressing with cloth, or applying burning objects, and the like, it will not stop in this manner, except rarely.  If anyone is presented with this situation and a physician or medicine is not readily available, they should immediately place their index finger over the opening of the wound itself, as we have described.
He should firmly compress it until the blood is contained and emerges from above the wound and the artery, and the finger should not be removed from it; continually apply very cold water to it until the blood clots and thickens and stops flowing.  During this time, assess what further cauterization or medication is needed.
Chapter Two.
On the incision, lancing, phlebotomy, and similar surgeries.
In the first chapter, we discussed every illness amenable to cauterization with fire and caustic medications, their causes, reasons, and instruments; and the various types of cauterization.  We arranged this in sections, from the head to the foot.
I will follow the same approach in this chapter to make it easier for the student to find what they need.
Before I begin, you, my children, should know that this chapter contains more uncertainties than the first chapter on cauterization.
Therefore, caution must be greater here, for in this chapter, actions frequently result in the loss of life-sustaining blood when opening a vein or cutting through a tumor, lancing an abscess, treating a wound, removing an arrow, or cutting out a stone, and similar procedures, all of which are accompanied by risk and fear, and in most cases, lead to death.
I advise you to avoid actions involving doubt, for in this profession, you may encounter various kinds of people suffering from different illnesses. Some may be weary of their illness and indifferent to death.
Due to the severity of their illness and the prolonged suffering, their condition may indicate death. Some offer you their wealth in hopes of regaining health, and their illness is fatal, so you should not aid those who display such characteristics.
Let your caution exceed your desires and eagerness. Do not undertake anything without certain knowledge of the desired outcome. In all your treatments of patients, use advanced knowledge and warn them of the potential outcome for their well-being.
This will aid you in gaining praise, glory, and remembrance. May God, my children, inspire you with wisdom, and may He not deprive you of correctness and success. For that is in His hands; there is no god but Him.
I have arranged this chapter's sections following the previous chapter on cauterization, from the head to the feet, so that you may easily find what you need, God willing.
The First Chapter.
On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment often occurs in infants at birth if the midwife presses the infant's head roughly.  It may also arise from a hidden, unknown cause.
I have not seen this ailment in anyone but infants, and all those I saw succumbed quickly to it.  Therefore, I have deemed it best to refrain from treatment.  Indeed, I have seen an infant whose head filled with water, and whose head grew larger every day. Until the infant could no longer sit up due to the size of its head, and the moisture increased until it perished.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone or under the bone on the peritoneum.  If the moisture is between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, then one horizontal incision should be made in the middle of the head, about two fingers in length, to allow the moisture to drain.  This is the image of the lancet.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling larger, make two intersecting incisions like this.
If the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of this is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and the water sinks inwards when pressed with your hand—this should not be hidden from you—then three incisions should be made in the middle of the head, like this.
After the incision, all the moisture will come out. Then the incisions should be closed with strips and bandages.  Then it should be covered from above with poultices and oil until the fifth day.  Then the bandages are removed and the wound is treated with lint and ointments. Do not restrict the head's movement excessively. Feed the patient a diet of all dry foods low in moisture.
Until the limb strengthens and heals.  Another method of incision is to observe where the swelling's bone and the accumulation of water are visible, because it may be more in the back of the head, or the front, or the right, or the left.
Therefore, aim the incision where the swelling and the water accumulation are apparent.  Make the incision as best you can, taking care not to sever an artery, causing bleeding that could kill the patient from the hemorrhage, while draining the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Severing the two arteries behind the ears, known as the *ḥasīsīn*.
If someone suffers from a severe affliction of the eyes or chest, and this persists despite treatment with medications, the best treatment in such cases is to sever these two arteries.
If you wish to sever them, you should first shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to expose the artery.  Then, hold the patient's neck firm with his own garment, and look for where the vein pulsates, at the two recessed areas behind the ears.  These locations are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Then, mark them with ink, and sever them with a dissecting scalpel, completely to the bone.  This should be done with the head oriented horizontally.  If you prefer, introduce the scalpel beneath the artery, and cut upwards.  The incision should be about two closed fingers in length.
If the artery is severed, the blood will flow in a pulsating fashion, forward and rapidly, in a continuous stream. If the artery is not visible, then you should estimate from the ear, about three fingers' breadth, and mark it with ink and cut to the bone.  What is necessary to...
Six ounces of blood will likely be released immediately on average; sometimes more, sometimes less.  This depends on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries.  Then, examine the wound. If any part of the peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it away.
So that a hot swelling does not occur. Then, bind the wound with a linen bandage and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
The arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic headaches or acute illnesses brought on by sharp humidity and heat in the muscles of the temples, or from severe chronic headaches, and the usual medical treatments have proven ineffective, we have used the method of cauterizing or cutting the arteries of the temples, as described.
The method for cutting them is that the patient should shave the hair from the temples, and locate the visible artery in the temple, as its pulse will be apparent; it is rarely hidden, except perhaps in some individuals.
Or, if it is difficult to locate the artery due to extreme cold, the patient should tighten their neck with their clothing, then you should rub the area with a cloth, or apply warm water to the area until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the scalpel, which has this shape. Then, gently slice the skin until you reach the artery, then insert a hook and pull it upward until you remove it from the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides.  If the artery is thin, twist it with the hook. Then cut off a piece of the artery, just enough to separate its ends and cause contraction without bleeding. If it is not severed and cut, the blood will not recede.  Then drain the blood from six to three ounces.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with strong doubled thread, whether of silk or bowstring, so that gangrene does not set in before the wound heals, thereby causing further bleeding.
Then cut away the excess between the ligatures, doing this at that time or later. If you wish, cauterize it down to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery, until its ends are severed, achieving the same result or even better, as we said.
However, if the patient has a fever or a heated temperament, cauterization helps to consume moisture, making it more beneficial.  After the arteries have been treated, the area should be packed with old linen and secured with firm bandages.  After healing, treat with dry medications to promote tissue growth and with lint until healing, God willing.
If, during your work, bleeding occurs from the artery, quickly stop it, either by cauterization or by filling the area with a sealant and applying pressure until the bleeding stops.  If none of these is available, apply your finger until the blood clots.
Apply very cold water to the area to reduce inflammation and secure it properly.  A gentler and easier method than treating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the areas with ink.
Apply the cautery very intensely until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed at two points, so that the ends are separated.  This cauterization will not allow them to rejoin.  This is an image of the cautery.
The cautery is sharp-bladed, resembling small daggers, but significantly less sharp than a knife.  If they were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach them faster and the flesh would not quickly sever.  However, if there is some thickness to them, the heat of the fire will stay contained.
It quickly severs the flesh.  This method is better than all others, and gentler and easier.  The distance between the blades should be the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
In treating the constant, hot watery discharge from the eyes.
If the discharge of tears is constant, originating from the veins on the skull's exterior, and no medicinal treatment is effective, and you see the patient's face has reddened. And he feels a tingling sensation on his forehead, like an ant's crawling. His eyes are sunken and wet, their edges worn and their eyelids glued shut from the intensity of the tears.  The early practitioners of this treatment were forced to employ this method, which they call the "treatment with the sword". It involves ordering the patient to shave the hair on his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made on the forehead, running along the length of the forehead. Each incision is approximately two fingers in length, parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second one slightly away from the action of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the opposite side.
And beware of cutting the arteries on either side, keeping your hand away from the contact of the jaws.  After each incision, there should be a space of about three fingers clenched together. Have at the ready prepared sponges or numerous dry cloths for absorbing the blood.
Then, insert the sharp double-ended lancet, whose image is this. From the incision next to the temple, to the middle incision, use it to remove all skin and periosteum between the incisions. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision. Then withdraw the lancet. And insert into the first incision another instrument, called a single-edged, sharp knife, smooth and blunt on the other side. This is its image.
Place the sharp side of the knife upwards towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision, cutting all the vessels descending from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do the same from the middle incision to the other incision.  After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, compress the areas of coagulated blood. Then, in each incision, place a cotton wick and apply a compress soaked in a mixture of vinegar and oil, or oil alone.
So that a hot swelling does not occur. On the third day, the ligatures are removed and copious application of lukewarm water is used. Then, treat it with basil ointment mixed with rose oil, and other remedies for wounds, until healed, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In treating tears and discharges to the eyes from the inside of the head.
When someone has frequent, severe, persistent discharges, and the eyes are weakened, small, and have poor vision, and the eyelids are ulcerated, and the eyelashes fall out. And there will be a sharp, painful headache deep within the head, and repeated sneezing. Know from these symptoms that these substances and discharges come from numerous deep veins. The best treatment is to have the patient shave their forehead, and then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there will be a sharp, painful headache deep within the head, and repeated sneezing. Know from these symptoms that these substances and discharges come from numerous deep veins. The best treatment is to have the patient shave their forehead, and then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or slightly higher, laterally, beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should be into the bone. Keep your hand away from the movable temple muscles when chewing.  Once the bone is exposed and all the blood has been wiped away with a sponge.
Separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or linen thread, then tie it from above with bandages.  Soak the bandages with medicine and oil to prevent a hot swelling.  Once you have treated it and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a desiccated remedy that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts of clyphonium and preparing an ointment from them to use in promoting flesh growth in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
On the treatment of things that fall into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a stone-like object such as iron and glass, or a seed or plant part such as chickpeas, nuts, and the like, or a liquid substance such as water and vinegar, and the like.
Or if it is an animal, if a stone or a stone-like object has fallen into the ear, and it does not grow within the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you see the stone, put some violet or syrgia oil on it, then try to remove it by moving the head or by inducing a sneeze with a khandas. And plug the nostrils when the sneeze comes, after placing a bandage of linen or wool around the ear and extending the ear upwards.  This treatment often removes the object. If it does not come out, try to remove it with a gentle, soft cloth that has the following description.
If it comes out with the cloth, otherwise, try removing it with a delicate, slightly bent, blind hook. If it does not come out with that, then make a copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal.
Seal around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil, so that the wind has no other way than through the tube.  Then pull it out forcefully with your breath.  This often removes it.  If it does not come out with the described methods, take a small piece of Nabataean gum or the kind used to catch birds and place it at the end of the tube.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, gently insert it into the ear canal after drying the ear from moisture.  If it does not come out with all the methods described, proceed to incision before a burning swelling or inflammation occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient in the temples, taking blood according to their strength.  Then, have the patient sit before you and turn their ear upward.  Make a small incision at the base of the ear near the cartilage, in the lower part of the ear.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone. Then remove it with the best tools possible.  Then quickly stitch the incision and treat it until it heals.
If the object that fell into the ear is one of the kinds of seeds that swell and enlarge, try to remove it with the methods mentioned. If it does not come out, take a slender, delicate scalpel shaped like this.
Try to cut that type of fallen seed in the ear with it.  Do this only if you are certain the seed has become moistened by the ear's moisture, so that it becomes numerous small pieces. Then remove them with a blind probe, or a gentle forceps, or by suction.
As mentioned, it will be easy to remove them.  As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use a handkerchief to induce sneezing.  The patient should lie on the ear that has water in it, having first filled the ear with some old cotton.  If it comes out that way, that's good.
Otherwise, take many small, smooth stones, warm them slightly over the fire. The patient inserts one into the ear canal. The patient then hops on one leg, toward that side, and strikes another stone against the stone in the ear.
He continues doing this, stone by stone, until all the water comes out.  Water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and heating the other end in the fire until it is mostly burnt.  Then another feather is used.
Repeat this until all the water is removed, or extract it with a tube, as previously mentioned for stones.  As for removing an animal that has entered the ear, if it is small, like a flea, or the like, treat it using what was previously mentioned in the section on the division of [problems]. As for...
If it is large enough to be felt, attempt to remove it with swabs and forceps.  This is easier than anything that grows in the ear.  As for removing worms that have developed in the ear, if treatment using what we have discussed in the section on the division of the topics on catarrh has not been successful.
Therefore, you should examine the ear in the sun. If any worms appear, remove them with swabs or fine forceps. If nothing is visible, take a tube, the illustration of which is as follows.
The tube is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top.  Insert the thin end into the ear, as far as the patient can tolerate, and then suck strongly with it.  Do this repeatedly until all the worms are removed.  If this does not work, seal around the tube with wax, as I have previously described for the stones.
If it does not come out with the methods described, use the ear drops that I have mentioned.  The ancients have used these to kill the worms, and you can find this in the section on ear drops.  You use the drops and medicines in the ear with this device, which has the following illustration:.
As you see, it is made of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top.  If you prefer, the tube within the main tube can be made of secure copper.  Alternatively, you can take a thread and wrap it around the end of the tube with a tight knot.
Then pour the ointment or juice, or whatever medicine you desire, into the tube while it is in the ear.  Then, insert the thread with the cotton on top and squeeze it with your hand in a moderate way, so the ointment flows into the ear and creates a sensation.
Have the patient lie down inside, and make sure whatever you put in the ear is warmed slightly in the fire.  Be careful that what you are dripping into the ear is not excessively cold or excessively hot, as the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of obstructions of the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear canals unpierced.
Some people may also experience an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or a growth of flesh there.  This obstruction may be deep within the ear canal, hidden from sight.
It may also present slightly outside the canal, and be visible.  That which is deep in the ear, and not visible, is in most cases difficult to cure.  If it is visible, then the affected ear should be placed in the sun. And examine it. If you see the obstruction externally, then open it with a gentle scalpel, in this form:
Its tip will have a slightly limited projection, while the rest of the scalpel will be smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, then grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently and thoroughly until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, gentle probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction, along with the patient experiencing a heaviness of hearing, gently remove it.
Be careful not to injure the ear's nerve. Then, insert a wick into the ear, sized according to the canal opening, and smeared with Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days until the wound is healed. Or, take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered alum on it.
Use it. If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot tumor, then it is necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another wick smeared in Qirawi ointment, made with rose oil, to reduce the hot swelling. Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear.  Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding, as described in the section on bleeding.
Chapter Eight.
On treating warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  One must grasp them with a forceps or needle, and cut them from their roots with a scalpel, then apply powdered alum to the area.
If bleeding occurs, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cautery iron.  Cauterizing is better after cutting.  It often returns if any part of the roots remain.  If cauterized with fire, those roots are burned away and it does not return.
Chapter Nine.
On treating cold afflictions of the eyelids.
A condition resembling cold in its severity and hardness often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called "cold" (برد), being a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  If the cold is protruding on the surface of the eyelid, moving in every direction, the treatment is simple: make a slit across it.
Then gently peel it from all sides until it is released, then hang it with a hook and cut it off.  If cutting it does not appear possible without penetrating the eyelid, that will not harm the patient.  If the slit is large, gather it with stitching and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there is no problem; the ointment will heal and mend it. If the cold is sloping inwards towards the inner surface of the eyelid, turn the eyelid inside out, hang the cold with a hook without needing a slit, and trim it from every side.
If it penetrates the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye with salt water after cutting off the cold, and treat the area with what will heal it until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
On treating the hordeolum that appears on the eyelid.
A hordeolum is a swelling that occurs in the layers of the upper eyelid.  It occurs most often in young boys, causing their eyes to feel heavy, and it leads to colds in the early hours of the morning. They are unable to look at the sun's light. So that the tears hasten to them.
Therefore, you see them leaning on their faces and sleeping on them, with their eyelids under the eyebrows damp, swollen, and the hordeolum clearly visible.  If you press the area with your fingers, you feel the hordeolum between them.  The treatment is to have the patient place their head in your lap.
Then, take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick large enough to encircle the hordeolum from every side.  Then place it over the hordeolum and press with your fingers from every side to gather the hordeolum in the center of the circle.
Then, make a crosswise incision in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, an incision no larger than that made in bloodletting.  As for the depth, you should cut through all the skin until you reach the hordeolum.
In most cases, the hordeolum will protrude from the incision as a white fatty piece.  Pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, moving your hand right and left, until it heals.  Be careful not to enlarge the incision, lest the lancet injure the eye.
If the hordeolum does not appear at the initial incision, you should gently enlarge the incision slightly until the hordeolum protrudes.  Then, pull it out as we described.  Then, dip a cloth in vinegar and water, place it over the area, and secure it with a bandage.  Some people crush salt.
They place it in the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture. Then treat it until it heals.  If a hot swelling occurs at the site, treat it with cooling compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the methods of bandaging the eye.
If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid, deviating from the natural course beneath the natural eyelashes and becoming stubborn, they harm the eye and cause various ailments such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, and inflammation, even causing the eye to become unusable.
The bandaging of the eye has four aspects: either by cauterization with fire, or by a sharp medicine, as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or it may be by cutting and stitching, or by applying a reed, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, then insert a needle with thread from below the eyelid and pierce the needle with the thread from above, close to the hair itself. Pull the thread upward on the eyelid.
Turn it with a rod, then cut into the inner part of the eyelid, avoiding the excess hair, with a needle-scraper from the larger to the smaller incision.  Then, pull out the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth beneath the eyelid.  Then, bandage the eyelid with a dressing.
It should be like the shape of a rue leaf, but the shape should be as much as needed to raise the eyelid, since this may differ from person to person. Some may need a specific amount of the eyelid cut off, in proportion to how much the eyelid has relaxed.
Some require a smaller cut, all according to the degree of eyelid relaxation. Then, cut with the needle-scraper along the lines you have marked, beginning from the larger incision to the smaller one. The incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a rod.
Then, insert the hook into one corner of the skin, then peel it all off.  Then, stitch the two lips together with a needle and thin wool thread. Wipe away the blood and attach any remaining threads to the eyebrows with adhesive substances.
You may do this, or not bother.  Then the stitches and threads remain for about three or four days, then treat it. If you prefer, you can leave the wound unstitched and treat it with something that dries and contracts it. The eyelid will lift when the wound is closed and brought together. Stitching is better.
This method of tightening, the ancients mentioned it, though it is somewhat arduous for the patient.  It is a good method, and there is no danger.  Another method of tightening is to shape the eyelid like a rue leaf, as described. Then lift the eyelid with three hooks, which may be separate or grouped in this manner:
Then cut off any excess eyelid with a small pair of scissors, in this manner, cutting evenly.
If you are unable to hold the hooks in place or if they are not properly positioned, take a needle with thread, insert it into the center of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger corner, and a third thread near the smaller corner.  Bring the threads together evenly with your fingers, then raise your hand steadily using them.
Raise the entire marked skin as described, then stitch the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals.  If a hot swelling occurs during the cutting or incision, relieve that swelling with a `qiyru`ti and similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also have its folds turned inward.  In this case, the cutting, stitching, cauterization with fire or with a sharp medicine described above should be used.  Cauterization with fire or with a sharp medicine is more effective and less harmful to the patient than cutting and stitching; in these cases, the better approach is preferred.
Cauterization with reeds is done in this way: turn the eyelid, make the incision from the inside as described, then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to that of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
Having trimmed them from both sides where the threads attach, gently bring them together on the remaining part of the eyelid, and tightly tie the reeds from both sides.  Leave it for some days, and the tightened skin will die, turn black, and decay.
Until it falls off on its own. If it takes too long, trim it with the scissors, then treat it until it heals.  When it is healed, the eyelid will rise and the lashes will not prick the eye. This is the shape and size of the two reeds, made precisely to this length and width:.
Chapter Twelve.
For removing irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
If there is a hair or two, the procedure is to take a thin needle, thread it with a fine, smooth silk thread, tie its ends with a very gentle knot, and make the thread about a span long.
Then, thread a second, thinner thread into the tweezers, and tie its ends, if desired.  The patient should place their head on your lap, close to the light so the work is clear, for it is delicate work.  Then, with the needle attached to the tweezers, insert it into the base of the extra hair.
And, quickly, pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out beyond the normal hair.  Then pull the thread upward with the tweezers and extract the hair from the tweezers, whether one, two, or three—no more.
Then, pull with your hand until the hair comes out with the tweezers, in the eyelid, along with the natural hair.  If the tweezers are pulled and the hair does not come out with them, pull the tweezers downward with the thread you attached, until the tweezers exit through the upper hole.
Then, reinsert the hair into the tweezers and pull them out.  Repeat this until it rises through the upper hole and you see it clearly.  Then release the tweezers and thread and remove them.  Press the eye shut and leave it pressed for two or three days, until the hair is firmly in place and the flesh grows around it.
If the hair is short, either add a longer hair from the natural head, so it rises with it, or let it grow longer, and then remove it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the treatment of the stye that occurs in the upper eyelid.
This stye, which is called a "hare-lip," can be either natural or accidental.  The accidental stye is from the inflammation of a wound, cut, burn, or similar.
The treatment involves incising the inflammation, separating its edges, and placing a flax thread between them and tying it until healed.  It is not advisable to use things that dry and constrict in treating it.
If you do that, the stye will return more severely.  Instead, use things that soften, such as fenugreek, lentil-water boiled with saffron, flaxseed, and a diachylon ointment mixed with some oils.  Apply this to the thread and use it for treatment.
The aim of the treatment is to prevent it from re-adhering in its original form.  This method we described is only a partial correction of the stye, not a restoration of the original condition.
Chapter Fourteen.
On treating the stye that forms in the lower eyelid.
This stye, which forms from below, is properly called a stye.  It is either natural or accidental; the accidental stye results from a wound, incision, cauterization, or similar causes.
The method is to take a needle with a double thread, insert it into the flesh, piercing from the inner to the outer eyelid until the thread is on both sides of the flesh.  Then, pull the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper form, then well and good. Otherwise, take a spatula, apply it to the wound, and with it, turn the eyelid inside out. Make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, positioning the edges of the incisions at the angles of the incision you made, so they meet to form an angle. So that when they come together, its shape will resemble this form:
Then, remove the flesh to the extent that the sharp side of it is below the eyelid. Then, bring together the separated parts with two stitches, sewing it with a thread of wool. Then, treat it with the relaxing and astringent medications we mentioned, until it heals.
If the wound is from a cut, stitch, or cauterization, a simple incision should be made, also devoid of eyelashes, as previously described. Then, separate the lips with astringents, as we have mentioned.
In summary, for treating a wound (shatra) whether from above or below, perform the procedure according to the presentation of the wound, as it can vary significantly in appearance. The skilled craftsman devises a solution by any means possible.
Until the shape returns to its natural form, or nearly so. The disease itself indicates the appropriate treatment and tools in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may affect many people, with the upper eyelid adhering to the white of the eye, preventing its ease of movement and hindering its normal functions.  Therefore, a slender instrument should be inserted under the eyelid.
Lift it upwards, or extend it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not as sharp as other scalpels, but rather like a scraper, so that the patient is not disturbed during the procedure, preventing the scalpel from slipping and injuring the eye with its sharpness; your incision should be as if you were peeling away the adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural position and the adhesion is completely healed. Then apply salt water to the eye to wash it or instill a solution of verdigris in water from a dropper, and then separate the eyelid and eye with a linen wick.
Place wet egg white on top of the eye.  After three days, use lead-based eye drops until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
In the excision of the toenail and deep flesh growths.
The toenail is of two types: either it is nervous, resembling a tough, thin membrane, or it is non-nervous, resembling a hard, white moisture that breaks if touched by iron or attempted to be removed with forceps.
For forceps do not hold it, and both types begin in the larger area and gradually spread to cover the eye and prevent light and eye movement. The procedure for removing it is to have the patient place their head in your lap.
Then, open their eyes and raise the eyelid with your hand. Then, grasp the toenail with a slightly bent forceps and pull it upward. Then, take a needle, thread it with horse or cow hair and strong thread, slightly bend the needle tip, and insert it into the middle of the toenail.
Pierce it with the needle, tie the toenail with the thread, pull it upward, and peel the toenail side that is next to the pupil as if spreading it out with the thread. Then cut the rest at the base of the growth with a gentle scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the growth.
So as not to cause constant tearing from the cutting, the toenail may be pulled with forceps alone or with thread, as we stated, and then the smooth scalpel is used to peel the portion that looks like this:.
Be careful not to touch the corneal membrane with the scalpel, causing a perforation in the pupil. Then, after cutting, place some powdered salt or zanjari shiyaf into the eye and leave it until the next day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the toenail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or secure forceps, this type of toenail is often treated with medication, and it heals as described in the classification.  If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, blunt scalpel, like this image. Gently scrape the toenail from above with the scalpel. If you see it crumbling and breaking apart, after the scraping, put a drop of zanjari shiyaf, or red shiyaf, or powdered salt into the eye and compress the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until all of it is gone, unless a hot tumor appears in the eye.  Leave it and treat the hot tumor until it heals, then repeat the scraping until it heals.  As for the fleshy protrusion...
If the protrusion is causing excessive irritation to the eye, then grasp the protrusion with forceps and cut off a portion.  Do not cut excessively, lest it cause excessive tearing. Then apply red or zanjari shiyaf to the area until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the excision of the warty growths and excess flesh in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red, layered flesh may grow, covering the pupil or nearly reaching or overflowing onto the eyelids.  Sometimes the eyelids turn outward, resembling a rose.
The treatment is for the patient to place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and you should use appropriate forceps to remove all the red flesh.
Or hold it with a scalpel or a needle, then cut the flesh piece by piece until it is all removed.  Protect the eye from injury during the procedure.  The excision can be done with the scalpel that we described for removing a toenail, or with a small pair of scissors. Like the forceps used to remove splinters, as their image is shown in the following chapter.
When the excision is complete and all the flesh is gone, fill the eye with finely ground salt or instill red or similar corrosive medicines. Apply a bandage of egg white to the outside of the eye to prevent a hot swelling.
If any flesh remains and bleeding is heavy, and you fear a hot swelling, leave the eye and treat it with something that alleviates the swelling. Then return to the procedure until it heals.  Do the same with any excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye by nature or by appearance with surgical procedures using iron. Do not insert your hand into any of these procedures until you see that the organ is capable of withstanding the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the excision of the eye.
The vessels are red veins that weave over the eye, hindering its function and weakening it over time.  Therefore, you must first examine it. If the eye containing the vessels is strong and has no other ailments besides the vessels...
Then, the excision is to instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and to tie those vessels with a single hook or two, depending on your skill.  The hooks should be gently curved in this manner:
Or, two hooks can be double on one instrument, like this:
Then, gently excise those vessels with a fine scissors. Wipe away the blood periodically until you see the eye is free of those vessels and the bleeding has stopped.  Be careful not to injure the eye with the scissors' edges.  Work in the middle of the day, in the light of the sun.
Be very meticulous in your work so that you only cut the vessels. Once finished, apply green or red acacia powder to the eye to consume any remaining vessels. If you cannot remove all of them at once, bandage the eye to alleviate any pain.
Leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is gone.  Then repeat the procedure in the same manner until healed. This is the form of the scissors for this purpose.
Leave it [and let the patient's head rest on the student's lap.  Another student should wipe away tears and examine the front and back of the eye.] The best practice is to open the eye with fixed or triangular openers held by a student.
Carefully, with the patient's head resting in the student's lap, and another student wiping away tears and examining the front and back of the eye, you have the option to start the excision from the upper or lower part of the eye.  It is preferable to first remove two vessels on the upper side, one at the end of the circle and the other at the beginning.
Hold it with the middle and index fingers, then attach forceps beneath them.  Then hold it with the ring and little fingers, gently removing your hand so you see all the vessels rise.  Cut the smaller ones with scissors, or a gentle scalpel, if you wish.
Insert the probe on a needle and explore all the vessels until they rise above the conjunctiva.  Do not cut the vessels while they are still moist, because the tears and blood will make them (soften/liquefy) on you.
Then cut with scissors whatever extends beyond the circle from above and below, so that nothing remains protruding except on the cornea. If possible, lift it from the cornea with the probe; this is better, and may be possible in some people.
If you cut it, the area will be irritated for several days; the pain will subside and the hot swelling will diminish, then repeat the procedure on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
On returning the reed to the nose.
If physicians call the reed a nasiri, and if, after treating it with cautery or a sharp, burning medicine, as previously described, it does not heal, then the only recourse is to make an incision on the tumor when it is ripe, and to extract all the moisture or pus from it.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see damage or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
The scraper, called the *khashna al-ras*, is made from Indian iron, with a round head like a seed.  It is engraved with fine grooves like a file or a scraper.  Place it on the damaged part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while slightly squeezing your hand, until you know that the damage has been removed.
Do this several times, then bind the area with drying, astringent medicines.  If the area is sealed, flesh grows there, and the discharge stops, and forty days pass without renewal, suppuration, or any incident.
Know then that it has healed, otherwise there is no remedy but to return the nasiri to the nasal opening in this manner: expose the bone again with iron or a sharp medicine.  Once the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The tip of the iron is triangular, and its shaft is a tapered cone narrowing to the tip, as you see.  Then place it on the bone itself, near the nostril, with your hand a little further from the eye.  Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
If he feels air coming out when he holds his hand to his nose, then bind the area with drying, astringent medicines, as I have taught you.  If flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter that was protruding outward will return to the nose, and this will be easier on the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On returning the eye protrusion.
If the whole eye protrudes, and no damage or deficiency occurs in vision, then you should ease the patient, then bind it with a bandage, then place a compress on the back of the neck without any specific preparation, and gently suction it.
Then, apply a poultice to the eye made from acacia, senna, frankincense, and henna.  Then, apply a bandage to the eye from above, using many bandages (refa'id).  The preparation of these bandages is to take many soft pieces of cloth, fold each piece into four layers, and make many of these.
Then place them one upon another as much as the eye needs, then tightly bind them with a strong cloth, and repeat the suctioning with the compress without any specific preparation.  Then remove the compress, and leave the eye bound for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during this time, then it should be tightened.  Then, remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said. If you see the eye has returned, then [stop], otherwise, repeat the bandage, the refa'id, the tightening, and the compress until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cutting the conjunctiva.
If a rupture occurs in the conjunctiva, then it tears and protrudes outside the eyelids like a piece of conjunctiva, making the person's appearance unsightly, and you wish to cut it, then the procedure is as I describe.
Insert a needle into the base of the conjunctiva from bottom to top.  Then, insert another needle carrying a double-threaded suture from the medial side and pierce through it, leaving the first needle in place.
Then cut the bend of the double thread and tie some of the conjunctiva around the needle and tighten it. Then remove the needle and apply wool soaked in egg white to the eye and leave it until the threads fall with the conjunctiva. Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals. The conjunctiva may be tightened from all sides with a circular bandage until the eye is more prominent.  Then, using a thin scalpel, it is incised into the depths of the eye, allowing the whitish moisture to drain.  The eye subsides and withers in its place, then it is tightened until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of abscesses.
This ailment, called an abscess, is a gathering in the eye resembling flowing water but without it. The method of treatment is to have the patient sit upright on a chair, then take their head in your hands from both sides.
Move it until you see the mass descend below with your eyes, then stabilize it, so that it does not move. Light will then emanate, and the patient will see objects as they used to. If the mass does not descend, we know it is water. If the described method does not cause the mass to descend.
Otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the cornea, near where the adhesion meets the cornea at the limbus, until the material comes out.
Then, instill warm water into the eye, mixed with honey, or water boiled with licorice and honey.  Then, continue with further treatment until recovery.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have already described the types of water in the classification, and which are suitable for instillation, with detailed explanation.  Obtain this knowledge from there.  Then, the patient should be seated before you, squatting facing the light, near the sun.
Tie and firmly hold the healthy eye, then raise the eyelid of the affected eye with your left hand if it is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then, place the tip of the cup near the limbus, with the thickness of a date seed, on the white part of the eye near the smaller eyelid, and push the cup firmly, rotating it with your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye, and you feel that the cup has reached an empty space.
The depth to which the cup should penetrate should be the distance from the boy to the edge of the black part (i.e., the limbus of the eye). The copper can then be seen by the observer in the same way as the eye, due to the clarity of the cornea.  Then, move the cup upward to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards repeatedly. If the water descends immediately, the patient will see what his sight has opened to him immediately, the cup in his eye, then remains still for a while. If the water rises, lower it again without removing the cup.
If it settles and does not rise, remove the cup gently, twisting your hand slightly, then dissolve some pure, fine rock salt in the water and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then, apply moist cotton or lint to the entire exterior of the eye.
With rose oil and egg white, bandage the healthy eye.  As for us and the people of our time, we use ground cumin mixed with egg white. If the cup will not enter the eye because of its hardness (for some people have extremely hard eyes). One should take the lancet, called the *bريد*, which is depicted as follows:
Pierce only the adhered tissue with it [the lancet].  Do not make the hole deep, but rather lightly touch the cup in a gentle spot. Then insert the cup as previously described.  Once you have finished, prepare a well-secured bed for the patient in a dark room, having them lie on their back.
He must refrain from all movement and coughing.  His food should be soft, and he must not move his head left or right at all.  Keep the bandage in place for three days.  Then, in the same dark room, remove the bandage and examine his eyesight.
Show him objects, then reapply the bandage for seven days.  You should not do this during the treatment or after the cupping, but rather avoid it before the water ascends quickly from the intense gaze.
If a hot swelling appears, then the eye should be treated before the seventh day, and the swelling should be soothed until it subsides.  Then, release the sight and place a veil over his face to train his eyesight from beneath it for several days in that dark room. Then...
He is then gradually taken out of the room and allowed to perform his duties.  Know that the learner cannot dispense with observing the cupping process several times before undertaking the procedure.  It has reached my ears that some Iraqis say they make a hollowed-out cup in Iraq that absorbs water.
I have not seen anyone in our country do that, nor have I read of it in any of the books of the ancients.  It may be a recent innovation.  Here is an illustration of the different types of cupping instruments for him to become familiar with them.
It is made of copper, specifically, and its tip is precisely that thin, triangular, and sharp-pointed.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Various superfluous flesh growths can occur in the nose, some resembling scorpions with numerous legs, others cancerous, hard, and dark colored, and still others soft and not dark colored.
For those growths that are soft, not malignant or cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun, open their nostril, and insert the hook into the flesh.  Then pull it out, and cut what was caught with a gentle, sharp scalpel, on one side only.
Until you know that all the flesh is gone. If any remains that you cannot cut, then scrape it off gently with a suitable instrument, so that nothing is left.  If bleeding or a hot tumor appears.
If it is malignant or cancerous, treat it quickly, cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone.  Then put into the nose, after cutting, vinegar and water, or a drink, if the nose opens and moisture flows down the throat.
Then know that it is healed. If the moisture does not drain properly, know that there is growing flesh within the spongy bones, which the cutting instrument did not reach.  In that case, you should take a thick linen thread.
Tie many knots in it, and make the space between each knot equal to or less than a finger.  The patient should use a rod or whatever is available to insert the end of the thread into their nostril, making it like a button, and pull on it until it reaches the septum.
It will come out through his throat.  Children often do similar things in school.  It is easy for whoever wants it.  Then tie together the two ends of the thread, one that came out the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to scrape the flesh, doing this until you know the flesh has been cut by the thread knots. Then take out the thread, and place it in the nose, after wiping away the blood, as a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for three days, or more.
Until the ointment has consumed all remaining flesh.  Then, as the last thing, place a lead tube in the nostril for a number of days until healed.  If further drying treatment is needed, use that.
This is a picture of the syringe used to instill ointments and medicines into the nose.
A small, open, ointment-applying lamp, made of silver or copper, is placed.
If you wish, make the tube closed, like a reed, and the applicator's ointment-applying surface flat.
It has a handle at the end, as you see, to grasp when warming the ointment or whatever liquid substances or materials you desire in it.
Chapter Twenty-five.
Concerning warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Warts often grow on the tip of the nose, increasing in size and number over time, until their appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, one should cut it off at its first appearance, removing the entire wart.  Then apply either cautery or a burning medicine that acts as a cautery to the affected area. If one delays cutting it until it grows large, then examine it. If it is hard, stony, dark-colored, and insensitive, ...
Do not use iron on it, for it is a cancerous tumor.  I have often seen that cutting this tumor has resulted in a severe affliction for the patient. If the tumor is soft to the touch and not dark-colored, and you see that it can be completely excised, Excise the tumor completely without hesitation or delay, and treat the area with something that dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is severed by a wound or similar injury, know that if a separation occurs in any of these cartilages, it rarely succeeds, except in some individuals.
Therefore, if such a thing happens to someone, examine if the wound is fresh with blood. If so, bring together the edges of the wound by suturing and then treat it until it heals. If the separation has separated its edges and each gap is intact, it is necessary to strip each gap of its visible skin thickness until it bleeds.
Then, bring the edges together with sutures, tighten them, and dust them with pulverized cinnamon and frankincense. Apply a plaster of palm ointment or other adhesive ointments on top of the powder. Leave it tightened for two or three days, then remove it.
Then change the medication and leave it until the threads dissolve on their own, then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to bring together the separated parts, either with needles as we described in abdominal suturing, or with thread, as I explained earlier.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
On the removal of knots that appear in the lips.
Many people may develop small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling carbuncles, others smaller or larger.  Therefore, you should turn the lip over and cut open each knot, and remove it with a forceps.
Cut it away from all sides, then fill the wound with powdered alum to stop the bleeding. Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the affected areas with astringents until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
On cutting excess flesh in the gums.
Excess flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called *apolus*.  It should be grasped with forceps or a scalpel, cut at its base, and the bleeding allowed to cease. Then, powdered alum should be applied to the area.
Or one of the astringent, dried roots. If that flesh returns after treatment, it often does. Cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
On scraping teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and out, and between the gums.  These may turn black, yellow, or green, causing decay to reach the gums and disfigure the teeth.
The patient should be seated before you, head resting on your lap.  You should scrape the tooth or teeth showing scales and sand-like matter until nothing of it remains.  Likewise, do this with any black, green, or yellow discoloration, until they are clean.
If the scraping removes all the matter on the first attempt, otherwise, repeat the scraping the next day, and again on the third, until you achieve your goal.  Know that teeth require scraping implements of various shapes and forms, according to what is suitable for your work.
Because the scraper used to scrape the tooth from the inside is different from the scraper used to scrape from the outside, and the scraper used between the teeth is of a different form.  These are different shapes of scrapers, all to be prepared beforehand.
Chapter Thirty.
On the extraction of teeth.
One should treat the tooth's pain by every means possible and delay tooth extraction, for there is no remedy after extraction, as it is a noble essence.  Only when extraction is unavoidable should it be done.
Therefore, if the patient is determined on extraction, one must make sure the pain of the tooth is resolved. Often, the patient is misled by the pain, thinking it is in a healthy tooth and extracting it; then, the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have seen this repeated in the actions of blood-letters.
If the tooth's specific pain is resolved, then one should make an incision around the tooth with a strong scalpel, separating the gum on all sides, and then move it gently, bit by bit, with your fingers or fine forceps, until it is loosened.
Then, firmly grasp the tooth with large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees, ensuring the tooth does not move.  Pull the tooth straight to prevent breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of those instruments, gently insert it beneath the tooth from all sides, and repeat the movement as done previously.
If the tooth is hollow or decayed, it is necessary to fill the cavity with a cloth and seal it tightly with a thin, smooth material to prevent it from shattering while you pull on it with forceps.  One should also carefully cut around the gum on all sides.
Use care to avoid breaking the tooth, as a piece remaining would cause the patient greater suffering than the initial pain.  Do not act like the ignorant blood-letters who attempt extraction without the methods we have described.
Often, they inflict great harm on people, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving the roots, either entirely or partially. Alternatively, the extraction may pull out part of the jawbone, as we have observed repeatedly.  After the extraction, the patient should rinse with liquid, vinegar, or salt water.  If bleeding occurs at the site, which often happens, then crush some alum and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, if alum does not work, use the delicate forceps, which first move the tooth.  These should have long handles, short grips, and thick construction to avoid bending when you grip the tooth with them.  Here is the image of the larger forceps.
Its grips should be thick, so that when you grasp them, they will not yield or bend.  The handles should be short.  They should be made of Indian steel or tempered, strong, well-forged steel.  At the tips, there should be teeth that fit into each other, creating a tight and firm grip.
The tips can also be shaped like a file, making for a strong grip.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On extracting the roots of teeth and removing fractured jawbones.
If a root of the tooth remains broken after extraction, you should apply cotton soaked in oil for a day or two to allow the area to relax, then use a forceps or pliers. Which resembles the beak of the bird called a 'blerja' and this is a picture of the pliers.
If it is not possible to remove it with these pliers, it should be fashioned like a rasp from the inside or like a scraper.  Then, one should make a hole in the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, and then insert the instrument, which is like a small lever, whose image is this.
Short, somewhat thick at the end, and not too sharp so as not to break. If the root is removed by this, then fine; otherwise use these other instruments, whose image is this: The first is triangular at the end, with some thickness.
Another delicate triangular image.
We may also use this instrument with two branches, whose image is also this.
And with other instruments and tools mentioned in the inventory of teeth, and we may also use this instrument which resembles a large fishhook, whose image is this.
Triangular, bent at the end, with some slight thickness to prevent breakage, and not sharp.  Know that instruments for teeth are numerous, as are all other instruments—scarcely countable.  A skillful craftsman, through his craft, may invent instruments according to the indications of the work and the diseases themselves.
Because there are diseases for which the ancients did not describe instruments due to the variety of types.  If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth breaks or becomes decayed, search for it in its place with what is suitable from one of these instruments and pliers mentioned in the extraction of the roots.
And we use a forceps, its image is this.
It should have some slight thickness to grip the bone firmly so it doesn't slip out until it is extracted.  The area is treated with appropriate medications. If the bone is slightly decayed, remove the decay and discoloration until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
The Thirty-second Chapter.
In the extraction of erupting teeth.
Teeth that erupt out of their natural path disfigure the appearance, especially in women and slaves.  Careful consideration should be given; if a tooth has erupted behind another tooth,
If it cannot be extracted or repositioned, remove it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it off using this instrument, whose image is shown here:.
It resembles a small beak, made of sharp, Indian steel.  Cut it in several sessions due to the tooth's hardness, and to avoid disturbing other teeth. If it is protruding and firmly positioned, use an Indian-made file to smooth it down, the image of which is given here.
It should be entirely Indian steel, with very fine carvings, similar to the file used to make needles.  Carefully smooth the tooth down a little at a time over many days, to prevent it from loosening and falling out.  Then smooth it finally and clean it with some scrapers.
If a tooth has broken, causing the tongue discomfort during speech, it should also be smoothed until the roughness of the break is gone, and it is level and smooth, no longer causing discomfort to the tongue or impairing speech.
Chapter Thirty-three.
In fastening loose teeth with silver or gold thread.
If older teeth become loose and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot eat anything for fear of them falling out, and treatment with astringent medicines has been ineffective.
The solution is to tie them with gold or silver thread. Gold is better, because silver corrodes and rots after a few days, while gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium thickness and thinness, fitting comfortably between the teeth.
The method of fastening is to take the thread and pass its bend between the two sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, one or more, until reaching a sound tooth on the other side.
Then weave back to the starting side, gently and skillfully tightening, so the teeth don't move.  Tighten the thread at the tooth roots to prevent it from loosening.  Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them, twist them together, and tuck them away between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
So the tongue is not harmed.  Then leave it tightened as long as it remains. If it loosens or breaks, tighten it with another thread, and it will remain in this way for a lifetime. This is the image of the teeth and the manner of fastening between two sound teeth and two loose teeth as you see.
A single tooth, or two, may be repositioned and fastened as described, and remain. However, this is done by a skilled craftsman. They might carve a piece of cow bone into the shape of a tooth and place it where the missing tooth was. And it is tightened as we said, and it remains in place.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On severing the ligament that lies under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament under the tongue may be either natural, present from birth, or accidental, resulting from a healed wound.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth, support their head in your lap, and lift their tongue.  Then, sever the nerve ligament transversely, allowing the tongue to be released. If there is some stiffness or entanglement, and it's from a healed wound, use a probe and slit it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots are loosened.
Be careful not to cut too deep into the flesh, thereby severing an artery and causing bleeding. Then, after the incision, rinse the area with rosewater or vinegar and cold water.  Place a linen wick under the tongue for the patient to hold each night.
To prevent re-adhesion.  If bleeding occurs, apply powdered alum to the area.  If the bleeding is excessive, cauterize the area with a suitable lens cautery. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until healed.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
Removing the frog produced under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small frog may develop under the tongue, hindering its natural function, and possibly enlarging to fill the mouth.  The procedure is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the tumor.
If you see it dark-colored or black and hard, with no sensation for the patient, do not attempt to treat it, for it is cancer. If it leans toward whiteness and has moisture, use forceps to open it and carefully dissect it from all sides.
If blood overwhelms you during your work, apply powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then continue with your work until you extract it completely.  Then have the patient gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with any other appropriate treatment until healed.
Chapter Thirty-six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And any tumors growing in the throat may present glands resembling those appearing externally, called tonsils.  If you treat them as described in the classification and they do not heal...
If the tumor is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive, do not use a scalpel.  If it is red and thick-rooted, likewise do not use a scalpel, for fear of bleeding.  Instead, leave it until it ripens, either by compression or spontaneous rupture.
If it is white, round, and thin-rooted, this is the one that should be cut. Before operating, observe if the intense inflammation has completely subsided or if some of it has abated.
Then, have the patient sit facing the sun, head in your lap, mouth open.  Take an assistant, and using an instrument, press the tongue downwards.  This is its shape:
Make it of silver or copper, thin like a knife.  When you press the tongue with it, and the tumor is visible, and you see it, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outward as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes along with it.
Then, cut it with an instrument, similar to scissors but with the ends bent, each sharp edge facing the other.  It is made of Indian steel or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel.  This is its image.
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other.  After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.  Then, after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or rue leaves, or similar astringents, have been boiled until the bleeding stops.  Then treat until healed.  Other tumors may grow in the throat, besides the tonsils, and these are cut in the same way as the tonsils.
I treated a woman who had a tumor growing inside her throat, approaching the uvula, almost blocking the throat.  The woman was breathing through a narrow passage. Eating and drinking water had become difficult.
She was close to death if she had lived another day or two.  The tumor had grown two branches extending to her nostrils.  I acted quickly, inserting a hook into one of them, and pulling it out, removing a suitable piece.
Then I cut it where it emerged from the nostril, and then did the same with the other nostril.  Then I opened her mouth and pressed down her tongue. Then, I inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut off a portion of it.  Only a small amount of blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately drank water and ate.  We repeatedly cut away from that tumor over a long period, and the tumor grew back what we cut away, until the task took up a long time for both of us.
I devised a method and cauterized the tumor inside the throat, which stopped its growth.  Then I left the area. I do not know what happened to her after I left.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On cutting a tumor of the throat.
If a tumor descends to the throat and swells, and is white and oblong, it is called a column. If it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called an enbul. If treatment as described in the classification does not succeed.
If the hot tumor has subsided and it is thin, then it should be cut.  If it is a solid, round mass, without length, and is blood red, or dark-colored, or black, or lacks sensation, then it should be avoided.
For there is danger to the patient.  Therefore, if you see it with the characteristics mentioned, its whiteness and length, the patient should sit facing the sun, and the tongue should be held down with the instrument previously described, then the probe should be inserted into the enbul.
Pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the section on tonsil removal. Only the portion exceeding the natural size should be cut;  if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after the cutting, use the methods described for tonsil removal and treat it until it heals. If the patient refuses the cutting, then apply cautery without fear or hesitation.  The application of cautery is with a sharp medicine, placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then, hold down the tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take the sharp water mentioned in the chapter on cautery, mix it with unslaked lime, making it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument. This is its form:
The end of the instrument where the medicine is placed has a concavity like a tamarind spoon. Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, while the patient lies on their side, so that saliva flows from the mouth, from the inside of the throat, so that nothing goes down into the throat and harms him.
Then, hold the instrument with the medicine and press it onto the uvula for about half an hour until you see it turn black and the burning from the medicine subsides. If you wish, take a cotton ball, wrap it around the end of a tamarind spoon, and soak the cotton ball in the medicine.
Insert the tamarind spoon with the cotton into the tube from above so that the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired level of cautery of the uvula. Then leave it; it will wither and fall off after three or four days.  If you need to reapply the medicine, do so.
After the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a cotton ball soaked in ghee, removing any remaining medicine. Then, the patient should rinse with cold water and treat the area externally with compresses and internally with gargles until healed. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and avoids fear.
The uvula can also be treated with gentler methods than cauterization and cutting, using incense in this manner:  Take frankincense, saffron, sage, wormwood, dittany, chamomile, and rue, or similar herbs. Gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
And boil it, with the pot covered with clay, and having a hole in the middle of the cover, into which the hollow instrument is fitted, crafted from silver or copper.
Insert the end of the instrument with the pomegranate into the patient's mouth until the steam rises to the uvula through the tube.  The uvula will contract. Then repeat this several times until it withers.  Beware, do not apply this treatment at the very beginning of the swelling.
For it often aggravates the swelling.  Instead, it should be done when the hot swelling subsides.  If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit a hard-boiled egg shell onto its end so the patient's mouth is not burned.
Because the egg shell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth. This is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On removing thorns and other foreign objects lodged in the throat.
Thorns, fish bones, or other objects frequently lodge in the throat.  One should remove any visible object that can be seen, after pressing down the tongue with the instrument, in the sun's light.
To make clear what is in the throat, and if something is hidden and not visible, the patient should vomit before the food is digested in their stomach.  Perhaps the lodged object will come out with the vomit, or the patient will swallow a piece of lint or a stalk of lettuce.
Or a piece of dry bread might be swallowed, or a soft piece of sea sponge is tied to a thread and swallowed.  When it reaches the thorn, quickly pull the thread repeatedly.
Often, the thorn or bone adheres to it and comes out.  If it does not come out by the methods mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
It should be slightly thicker than a lead rod.  At its tip, there is a bend.  The patient, gently, inserts it into their throat, with their head raised.  They must be careful not to touch their throat lest it cause coughing and dislodge the bone or thorn.  Or the physician inserts it with their hand.
The patient inserting it is better because they know the location of the lodged object.  They push it downwards or pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all in a manner suited to removing the object.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If the leech, treated as described in the section on medicinal treatment, proves ineffective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight after you have pressed their tongue down with the instrument I described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a gentle, firm forceps.  If you cannot do that, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech. Then, insert a heated iron into the tube's interior.
Do this several times. The patient should abstain from drinking water all day. Then, they should take a jar filled with cool water, open their mouth over it, rinse their mouth with it, but not swallow a drop.  Move the water with their hand from time to time.
The leech will fall off when it feels the water. If it does not come out using the methods described, fumigate the throat with urine and with incense using the instrument described for treating the nose. Do this several times, and it will fall off.
The method for using incense is to take a container with charcoal heated by fire. The container is covered with a lid having a hole in the center.  Place the end of the instrument in the hole.  Then, place the incense in the container.  The patient should place their mouth over the end of the tube and close their mouth to prevent the incense from escaping until it reaches their throat.
The leech will fall off at that point. If it does not, the incense is repeated several times. The patient should endure thirst and eat salty food and garlic, but not drink water.  It is essential that the leech be removed by this method. This is the image of the instrument used to draw the leech out of the throat when it is seen.
It resembles pincers, as you see, except that it has this curvature that enters the throat. Its tips resemble the beak of a bird.  It has the roughness of a file; if it grasps something, it will not let go.
Another instrument is used to press the tongue.  It is a wide ring of iron, sized to fit the mouth above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth, standing on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will. The patient cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument used to open the mouth in this exact manner.
Chapter Forty.
It deals with the incision and lancing of tumors.
Tumors are diverse and varied, as will be described one by one in this book.  They differ in their incision and lancing in two ways: first, from the type of tumor itself and the humors it contains.
The second type is by the locations in the body where they occur, since a tumor arising in the head is different from one arising in the buttocks, and a tumor in fleshy tissue differs from one in a joint. Each requires a different approach.
Some tumors should not be incised until the pus within has matured and become complete. Others should be incised while still unripe, such as tumors close to the joints.
For if a tumor near a joint grows until it infects the surrounding tissues, it might damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing the disability of the limb, or the tumor might be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay incision until it matures, you harm the vital organ, or if it is near the buttocks, you should incise it while still unripe.  It is necessary to incise an unripe tumor near the buttocks, lest the infection spread and reach the inside of the buttock, resulting in a fistula.
And it will become incurable to some degree.  You should know when to incise fully matured tumors, when the tumor's pain subsides, the fever goes away, the redness and throbbing diminish, the head of the tumor softens, and other symptoms abate.
The incision should be made at the lowest part of the tumor, if possible, to facilitate drainage downwards, or at the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  The incision should be made lengthwise if the tumors are in the arms or legs.
The incision should be made in the areas of the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and generally in all flat areas without folds.  As for areas that bend, the incision should follow the contours of the area.  If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is better to leave it alone.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said.  If you incise it before then, the pus will drain excessively, which is harmful and messy.  The edges and depths of the wound may become hardened.  Some tumors may need an incision across the body, if necessary, or in accordance with the needs of the organ.
Small tumors should be incised once, while large tumors should be incised with a wide incision or multiple incisions, depending on the tumor's size.  Some tumors may require a scraping of the skin and a cutting, if they have become like a patch of cloth.
Some have become somewhat dead, as occurs in many boils and abscesses. Some are incised in a three-sided shape, while others are cut like a rue leaf shape, like a scrotal tumor.
Some use a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar cuts.  For tumors without a head, like flat, smooth tumors, a simple incision is sufficient.  If the tumor is large and has accumulated for a long time, and you have incised it, do not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Instead, drain some of it, then compress the tumor for another day, and then drain some more pus.  Repeat this gradually until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a young child, or an elderly person, because the animal spirit often weakens with the sudden expulsion of pus.  The patient might die without your noticing it.  Be extremely cautious in this regard.
After incising these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it.  If the tumor wound is small or the incision is simple, use linen or worn cotton. If the tumor is large and the incisions are numerous,
Then, you should insert a wick into each incision, so that some reach each other. If part of the skin has been cut or torn from the tumor, you should fill it with worn cotton or linen strips, without moisture, and keep it compressed for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.  If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after which you should soak a linen cloth in them and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the methods and remedies and cauterization that we have described in many places in this book and in the sections. If it is winter and the tumor area is highly vascular, you should moisten the dressings with warm herbs and oil.
And place them on the area. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply dressings moistened with water and oil, or with herbs and oil, all cold.  Until, as we said, the third day, you should then dissolve the tumor and clean it.
Use similar treatments until it heals.  This is what you need to know about treating tumors in general.  Regarding detailed methods, each tumor has been described with its specific treatment, summarized and categorized.
Chapter Forty-one.
On the treatment of tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, which are a type of swelling containing sacs.  They are like the sacs of a chicken egg.  There are many types, some fatty, some containing a moisture like mud.
Some contain a moisture like pus and soup, and similar things. Some are hardened and solid.  All can be lanced and removed without danger, unless a blood vessel is encountered during the incision.
And the procedure for lancing them is to first probe them with the instrument, whose image will follow, called the *midas*, so you know what they contain.  If they contain moisture, lance them lengthwise with a simple incision, in this manner:
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~. If the moisture has been drained, strip away the sac containing the moisture and cut it all away completely, leaving nothing at all.  Often it will return if anything is left.
Then dip a cotton swab in the astringent ointment, if available, otherwise in salt water, and fill the wound with it.  Leave it until the next day, as it will consume any remaining sac. Then apply the cotton swab with the astringent again, and a third time, if necessary.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until healed. If the swelling contains fatty material, lance it in this manner:
Make a lancing incision, and place the forceps on the edges of the wound.  Strip it from every side, and exert all your effort in removing the membrane that contains it. If an artery obstructs you, do as was previously described for you. And do the same for a swelling if it is stony hard from the incision.
The treatment is exactly as mentioned.  Incision on a hardened swelling is easier, because it has less blood and moisture.  Some of these swellings in the head in some people contain no moisture at all. This is because I incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman, and found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone, that could not be broken, even if someone threw it, it would only be chipped.  And it was different from other swellings occurring in the head, like the swellings that occur in the heads of children.
At the roots of the ears, make a simple incision along the entire length.  Shape the edges from below, to facilitate the flow of material downwards.  Then treat it with appropriate remedies.
Chapter Forty-Two.
Concerning the incision on swine that frequently occur on the neck.  These swellings often appear on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin.  They may also appear elsewhere on the body.  A single one may appear on the neck, or many, and some arise from others.
Each such swelling is contained within its own membrane, as is the case with tumors and swellings of the head, as we have described.  These swellings come in various types: some are stony, others contain moisture, and some are malignant and unresponsive to treatment.
Of those I have observed, those that felt good and whose surface resembled the skin color, were movable in every direction, and were not attached to the neck nerves, vessels, or arteries, nor were they deep-seated. Then it should be incised simply from top to bottom of the body, in this manner, from line ~J~ to line ~B~.
And peel it from every side, stretching the edges of the skin with a hook or two, or several hooks if needed, as we have said regarding swellings of the head, removing it little by little.  Care should be taken not to cut a vein or nerve.  The scalpel should not be overly sharp.
So that your hand does not over-cut, or the patient become disturbed, and you cut what need not be cut. If you cut a vein or artery and it impedes your work, then place powdered alum or some of the powders that stop the bleeding into the wound.
Close the wound and leave it until the severity of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to fester.  The bleeding will then stop.  Return to your work until it is finished.  Then examine with your index finger if any remaining small pieces or slivers remain.  Cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the sliver, you should not cut the sliver at its base. Instead, you should tie it with a strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls out on its own without harm. Then fill the wound with used cotton, having dipped it in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut the entire sliver, then you should bring the edges of the wound together and stitch it immediately after verifying that no remnants remain. If you see that a remnant from the sliver of bone remains, then...
Then you should aim for the root and base of the sliver and use the stitching and what we mentioned.  For slivers that contain moisture, apply a simple poultice where you see the place of its ripening, and make the poultice from what is below, as we said.
Then, after the poultice, use a bandage with Egyptian ointment, or similar, to consume any remaining corruption.  Once you see the wound is clean, treat it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh until healed.
Chapter Forty-three.
On the incision of the windpipe for a tumor occurring within the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the windpipe, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it.  This accords with their statements.  However, those suffering from quinsy should avoid incisions in the windpipe, as they will not benefit from it.
In order that all the tumors and lungs may be diseased, and for those with a burning tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no affliction in the trachea, the incision of the windpipe must be used to escape the harm of suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do this, we must make an incision in the windpipe below three rings of the trachea or four small transverse incisions between two rings, as much as the incision is in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This location is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant, if the practitioner is timid, he should stretch the throat skin with a hook, then cut the skin until, when he reaches the trachea, he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he incises the peritoneum we have described, and he determines the incision of the trachea from the phlegm that comes out of it along with what is punctured and from the cessation of voice.  He leaves the wound open for a time.  When the time feared for suffocation has passed, he brings the edges of the wound together from the skin.
And he cuts it alone, separate from the cartilage, then the medicines that grow flesh are used until it heals. The author of this book says, "The meaning of this discourse is that, if they see the patient's throat obstructed by one of these tumors mentioned.
And when the patient was near death, and he intended to die, they went to incising the windpipe so that the patient could breathe through the wound site and be saved from death.  But they were instructed to leave the wound open until the course of the disease is completed, and its duration is usually three days or so.
At that time, they ordered the wound to be sewn up and treated until it healed.  What I saw with my own eyes was a servant who took a knife and slashed her throat, cutting a part of her lung.  I was called to treat her, and I found her weakening as a slaughtered animal weakens, and I uncovered the wound.
I found little blood coming from the wound, so I was certain that she had not severed an artery or vein.  Air was coming from the wound.  I immediately sutured the wound and treated it until she healed.  The servant experienced nothing except a slight hoarseness in the voice; nothing more.
And after a few days, she returned to her best condition.  From this, we say that incising the windpipe carries no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On incision of the tumor appearing on the larynx from the outside, called the laryngeal tumor.
This tumor, called the laryngeal tumor, is a large tumor the color of the body.  It is common in women and comes in two types.
Either it is natural or accidental.  The natural one is incurable.  The accidental one is of two types; one is similar to fatty tumors, and the other is similar to the tumor that arises from the entanglement of an artery.  There is danger in incising it. Therefore, one should not use a knife on it at all unless it is small.  If you probe and examine it with a blunt instrument and find that it resembles a fatty tumor and is not connected to any blood vessels, then cut it as you would a fatty tumor. Remove it with its contained sac, if it is in a sac.  Otherwise, remove it entirely.  Then treat the area with appropriate treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
On incision of the various tumors.
Tumors are of many types, and all their types have been mentioned in the classification.  It is necessary here to explain the difference between a tumor and an abscess, since it is problematic.  I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and frightening pains until the boiling of the matter subsides. When the putrefaction is complete, the fever and intensity subside.  A tumor does not have heat, fever, or pain. It is contained within a serous sac, a special covering, and is the same color as the body.  Its beginning is like a lentil, and it becomes like a fig, larger or smaller.
Tumors are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture.  The colors of the moisture are numerous, as mentioned in the classification.  Therefore, when you approach the treatment of a tumor, you must first probe and examine it with the instrument called the "medess," as its image will appear in the chapter after this one.
Estimate the size of the tumor, then withdraw the probe and observe what emerges afterward. If flowing moisture of any color comes out, incise it with a small incision as described in other tumors. If no moisture emerges after the probe, know that it is fatty.
Incise it with a cross-shaped incision, as I have instructed you.  Suspend it with forceps and carefully separate the skin from all sides.  If possible, remove the sac intact along with the tumor.
If the sac bursts during the procedure and you cannot remove it intact, as often happens, remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. If any part of it remains, large or small, the tumor will likely return.
If you are unable to remove all of it and a small portion remains, cauterize the wound with sharp cauterizing materials when finished.  Suture the wound and apply a cooling agent over the inflamed tumor, and treat it with other standard treatments until healed. If the tumor is large, suture its edges and treat with methods to promote healing.
If a bleeding or non-bleeding vessel obstructs you, immediately apply pulverized alum to the affected area, and leave it tight for two or three days until the wound becomes infected and the bleeding subsides.  Then proceed to remove any remaining tumor.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the images of the instruments.
In the images of the instruments used in incisions and punctures, there are various types of probes, categorized into large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Made of tempered steel, square at the tips, firm, to quickly enter tumors.  These are images of probes, called "bard," also categorized into large, medium, and small.  Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Suitable for probing tumors, wounds, sinuses, and cavities to find the bones and other contents within.  Made round, polished smooth like a stylus, of Chinese brass, or from isbadruyia, or from copper, or iron, or silver; the best are made of isbadruyia.
Probes may also be made of black lead, suitable for probing sinuses that have winding passages, as their flexibility will follow those windings.  These too are three types, namely long, medium, and short.
According to the needs of each sinus, its thickness should be proportionate to the sinus's width and narrowness.  Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks, which are numerous types.  Some are simple, having one hook, and these are three types: large, medium, and small.  Others are blind hooks, and these are three types.  And there are hooks with two hooks, three types.  And there are curved hooks with two hooks. And there are three types.  And there are hooks with three hooks, three types.  All these types need each one in its place.  Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium-sized simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.
Image of a large blind hook. Image of a medium-sized blind hook.
Image of a small blind hook.
Image of a large double-hooked instrument. Image of a medium-sized double-hooked instrument. Image of a small double-hooked instrument.
Image of a large three-hooked instrument.
Image of a medium-sized three-hooked instrument. Image of a small three-hooked instrument.
These are images of scalpels used to cut and remove tumors and masses.  There are three types, large, medium, and small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its cutting edges are limited, and the other ends are not limited, but made so that it can be used to remove the mass when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may find some relief from the burning sensation when removing the tumor.
These are images of retractors.  There are three types, large, medium, and small.  Image of a large retractor.
It is made of polished copper, similar to the material used for kohl, and on one end a wide spoon-like shape is formed from two layers, with a scalpel blade concealed within the head, resembling a bird's tongue that can be moved in and out as desired.
Images of scalpels that are hidden between the fingers when treating tumors, so the patient does not feel them. There are three types, large, medium, and small. Image of a large scalpel.
Images of cupping instruments used to cut blood flow. There are three types, large, medium, and small. Image of a large cupping instrument.
Made of copper or bronze, slightly elongated and rounded, as you see, and thin.  You should have these types of cupping instruments, large and small, to quickly cut blood in emergencies, when no medicine is available.
But they are not used to cut blood in every part of the body, but only in fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, groin, and similar moist fleshy parts.
And other smaller instruments can be made from it, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner.
Blood is cut with these if it flows from a venesection site, or when a vein or artery is cut.  A rounded version can also be made, as shown in this image.
Chapter forty-seven.
In the treatment of the male breast.
The breast of some people may swell at the age of puberty, becoming like a woman's breast, remaining swollen and unsightly.  If one dislikes this, then one should cut into the breast with a crescent-shaped incision, like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with the medicated ointment, then stitch the edges of the wound together and treat it until healed.  If the breast droops and relaxes due to its bone, as happens in women.
Then, incisions should be made in its upper sides, shaped like crescents, each touching the other at their ends, so that the larger incision encircles the smaller one, like this. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then the skin between the incisions is peeled back, the fat is removed, and the mentioned sutures and dressings, and whatever treatment is needed, are used until healed.
If you do not remove all that needs to be removed due to the patient's distress or bleeding, then the wound should be packed with cotton soaked in caustic ointment, and left until it consumes the remaining fat, then treated until healed.
The forty-eighth chapter.
On the treatment of tumors appearing under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the pig-like, hard, encapsulated variety, some containing moisture. Those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision, like this.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~. If all the fluid in the tumor is expelled, pack it with used cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until healed. If the tumor is of the pig-like cyst type, incise it as described in the section on pig-like cysts. If the wound continues to form pus, apply cauterization as mentioned previously.
Chapter Forty-nine.
On incising a tumor that arises from an artery or vein, called an aneurysm.
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it is adhered, a tumor often results. Similarly, a vein can also develop swelling and a tumor.
The signs by which one knows if the tumor and swelling are from an artery or vein: if from an artery, the tumor is oblong, compacted deep within the body, and if you push on the tumor with your finger, you feel it as though it has a crackling sound.
A tumor arising from a vein is round, on the surface of the body.  Incision of these tumors is dangerous, especially in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other locations on the body, particularly when large.  One should avoid treating them with a scalpel.
Also, tumors on the extremities or head should be avoided.  For those from arterial dilation, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, then widen the incision with forceps.  Then, dissect and free the artery from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pass it through to the other side.  Tie the artery with a doubled thread at two places, as I described for the arteries in the temples.  Then, pierce with a lancet the place between the ligaments, so that all the blood flows out.
The tumor will then subside, and you should then use treatments that produce pus until the ligaments fall off.  Afterwards, treat it with appropriate ointments until healed.
If the tumor arises from a ruptured vein, you should hold as much of the tumor with the skin as possible.  Then, insert a needle below the area you are holding with your hand, and pass a doubled thread through it until you bring it out from the other side. Then, tie the tumor firmly, in the same manner as I described for tying the gall bladder on both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread beneath the entire tumor, at the point where the first needle crosses.
Tie your threads in four places, then slit the tumor in the middle, until what is inside comes out. Cut off the excess skin, and leave what was tied. Then place a bandage soaked in a mixture of liquid and oil on it. Then use treatments involving twisting and ointments until healed.
Chapter Fifty.
Concerning the tumor resulting from nerve twisting.
Just as a tumor may appear in an artery or vein, so too may a tumor appear in a nerve if struck or caused by excessive fatigue or the like. This is most common in the wrists and ankles.
And in every joint where movement occurs, it is a hard tumor, similar in color to the rest of the body, often without pain.  If pressed firmly, the patient feels a sensation similar to numbness.  The tumor is not concentrated deep within the body.
Rather, it lies beneath the skin and moves in every direction, but does not go forward or backward.  Those in the joints should not be treated with iron, as this may cause a worsening condition.  And those in the head or forehead...
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from the root. If it is large, suspend it with a hook, dissect it, then remove it. Close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On cutting warts appearing on the abdomen.
Warts, called "fungal" due to their resemblance to fungi, frequently appear on the abdomens and other parts of the body of some people.  Their base is thin, and their head is thick, sometimes with a thickened edge.  They come in small and large sizes.
I once observed a man with two warts on his abdomen, resembling fungi in appearance.  Their thin, whitish base had thickened and cracked; moisture constantly dripped from them.  I cut them away; one weighed approximately eighteen ounces and the other approximately six ounces.
When cutting them, if the affliction is moist and the wart's color is white, moist, and thin-based, cut it with a broad scalpel.  Have heated cauterizing instruments at hand, as considerable bleeding often results from cutting them.
If bleeding overwhelms you, cauterize it.  If the affected area is sensitive and recoils from the cutting instrument, take a tightly wound lead thread and bind the wart of this description. Leave it for two days, then progressively tighten the lead thread.
As the lead thread tightens on the wart, it will eventually detach and fall away without further intervention.  If the wart has a thick base, cutting it involves some risk, particularly if it is on the abdomen. However, it may be possible to cut off half or part of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat the wound until it heals.  Beware of cutting a wart that is dark-colored, with little sensitivity and a dull appearance, as this is a cancerous tumor.  We will discuss cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-two.
On treating umbilical protrusions.
Umbilical protrusions arise from various causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum on the abdomen, causing the intestines or viscera to protrude, as occurs in other hernias; or from blood emanating from a vein or artery, as previously discussed; or from accumulated gas within it.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and the protrusion of the viscera, the tumor's color will be similar to the body's color, it will be soft without pain, and will appear with varying positions. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, its position will be even more variable than what we described; when you press it with your fingers, it will disappear and then return, and there may be rumbling associated with it. It will greatly enlarge during bathing and intense exertion. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
If, when pressed by your hand, it does not disappear, nor increase or decrease in size, then if it is caused by blood, the tumor will exhibit these signs, yet appear bluish-black.  If it is due to a growth of flesh, the swelling will be hard, firm, and remain at the same size.
If it is caused by gas, its touch will be soft.  The treatment in this case, if the umbilical protrusion is due to arterial or venous blood or gas, is to refrain from treatment, for there is danger and deception in it, as I informed you in the section where I discussed tumors originating from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to intestines or viscera, you should instruct the patient to hold himself and stand upright, outstretched, then apply medicaments around the entire umbilicus. Then you should have him lie on his back before you.  Then, using a wide scalpel, incise around the umbilicus at the spot you have marked with the medicaments.  Then, using a large forceps, pull the center of the tumor upward.  Finally, tie the incision with strong thread or fine silk, securely.
The knot of the bandage should be a loop. Then, open the center of the drawn-up tumor above the bandage, insert your index finger, and search for the intestines. If you find that the intestines have been caught by the bandage, loosen the loop and push the intestines back into the abdomen. If you find a hernia, pull it out with forceps.
Cut off the excess.  If an artery or vein is encountered, tie it securely, and return to your work. Take two needles, thread them with strong thread, and insert the needles into the incision you made around the tumor, piercing it firmly.  Then pull the tumor tight at four points on the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the drawn-up flesh rots and falls off of its own accord, or cut it off if it becomes thin and rotten.  Then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.  If the umbilical protrusion is from flesh that has grown there.
Or if it is from moisture, you should cauterize the tumor as we said, and remove the blood or moisture you find there.  Then treat it with what will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have previously mentioned the types of cancer in our classification, and how to treat it with medication, and warned against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate. We have also described cancer that develops in the uterus and warned against its treatment.
The ancients stated that if the cancer is in a place where it can be completely excised, such as cancer in the breast or the thigh, and similar removable organs, it should be removed entirely, especially if it is small and newly formed.  However, if it is advanced and large, it should not be approached.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve this.  If it is located in a readily accessible place, as we mentioned earlier, proceed with cupping to draw out the dark blood repeatedly, and then cauterize if there is a clear fullness in the veins.
Then apply cupping in a manner that will allow the procedure to be effective. Then insert the appropriate probes into the cancer, and cauterize it from all sides along with the skin, thoroughly, until nothing remains of its origins. Allow the blood to flow without interrupting it quickly.
Instead, press the areas and release all the thick blood with your hand or any instruments you can use.  If during the procedure, you encounter a large blood loss from a cut artery or vein, cauterize the affected area until the bleeding stops and then continue with the rest of the treatment until healing is complete.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the treatment of scabies.
We have informed you about the classification of hydrops, how water collects, the symptoms of each type, and its treatment with medications.  The type treated with iron is only the serous type; the other types, the sanguineous and the fleshy, should not be treated with iron at all.
If you have treated this serous type of scabies with medications and it has not been effective, then consider if the patient has become excessively weak or has another illness besides scabies, such as...
If there is a cough, diarrhea, or similar ailment, then avoid treating it with iron, for it is a gamble.  If you see a patient of robust constitution, who has no other illness besides the scabies, and is neither a child nor an old person, then the procedure is to place the patient standing before you. And a servant behind him will grasp his abdomen with his hands and push the water downwards towards the pubic area. Then, take a pointed scalpel in this manner:
Two-edged, long, and pointed, like a scalpel, except that it has some slight curvature so as not to penetrate the intestines during use and injure them. Then, observe if the scabies originated from the intestines.
Therefore, the incision should be three fingers below the navel, aligned with the pubic bone. If the scabies originates from a liver ailment, the incision should be three fingers to the left of the navel. If it originates from a spleen ailment, the incision should be three fingers to the right.
Also, the incision should not be on the side the patient wishes to lie on, to prevent the fluids from flowing to that weak area.  Then, pierce the skin completely with the instrument, and insert the instrument into the incision, then raise your hand.
With the scalpel, separate the skin from the peritoneum, as if peeling it, to the extent of a fingernail or similar. Then, pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, the location of the water. Then remove the water and insert the instrument, whose image is this, into the hole.
It is like a thin tube made of silver, or copper, or smooth, polished leather.  It has a small hole at the bottom and three holes on its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
A pointed tip, like the end of a pen, may be placed on the end, in this form.
At its upper end, there is a ring. When the instrument reaches the water, it will drain from it onto the instrument immediately.  Drain a moderate amount of water, because if you drain more than necessary at one time, the patient may die from the dissolution of their animal spirit.
Or it may cause a near-death faintness.  But drain only what his strength permits, based on the patient's pulse strength and complexion.  Then remove the instrument and retain the water, as it will immediately remain.
Because of the skin covering the opening in the diaphragm (which you were told to lubricate in that manner).  Then return the instrument another day if you see the patient able to withstand it.
Also remove a small amount of water.  Do this over several days, while keeping a close watch and avoiding mistakes, until only a small amount of water remains. If you fear for the patient's well-being and have left much water behind, treat it by burying it in hot sand.
A great deal of sweating in the bath and sun, and enduring thirst. Treat with dried medicines until he recovers. Cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as described previously.
Chapter Fifty-five.
In treating infants who are born with unperforated or narrow or misplaced urinary openings.
Some boys may be born with an unperforated urethra.  It is necessary to pierce it as soon as he is born.
With a very thin lancet in this manner:.
Then, insert a thin lead pin into the opening, tie it, and hold it in place for three or four days. When he needs to urinate, remove it and then replace it. If you don't use the lead, the urine passing through the opening might cause it to close up.
As for those with a narrow opening, it is treated with lead, as we said, for many days until it widens.  And those with an opening in the wrong place—some are born with the opening at the end of the urethra, unable to urinate forward.
Until he lifts the urethra upwards with his hand.  There will be no conception because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line. This is a very serious problem.  The treatment involves the patient lying on their back.
Then, with your left hand, stretch his urethra firmly, and carefully cut the head of the urethra with a sharp blade or lancet, as if carving something, to make its center prominent, like a urethra, so that the opening is in the proper position in the middle.
Be careful during the procedure to prevent bleeding, as it often occurs.  Use what stops blood and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
Concerning the ulcer that appears in the sheath, urethra, blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the sheath to the urethra.
This ulcer frequently appears in the urethra, a fleshy, dark swelling, and may be malignant or not.  The non-malignant one should be treated with a gentle snare.
Cut it until it is completely cleaned, then apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it with palm ointment until it heals.  If the ulcer is malignant, dark-colored, cauterization must be applied after cutting and scraping it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and some of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and some outside, then the ulcer inside must be removed first.  Once it has healed, then treat the exterior ulcer.
Because if you treat both simultaneously, you cannot be sure that the foreskin will not perforate.  It can also appear in women, and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption.  All blackened and corrupted parts must be excised.
Then apply honey, crushed and strained pomegranate rind, and crysanthemum afterward, and treat with the rest of the remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this way:.
Cauterization is beneficial for both cases, namely, bleeding and ulceration of the wound. If the wound is completely destroyed at some point, a lead tube must be inserted into the urethra for the patient to urinate through it.  As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the wound...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is healthy and who have not undergone circumcision.  Adhesion may also arise from a wound or tumor.  The foreskin should be separated with a sharp scalpel until the ligament is loosened and the wound is separated from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon examination, then a portion of the wound and foreskin should be separated, as the foreskin is thin and might easily perforate. Then separate the foreskin and wound with a thin, damp linen cloth in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat with a styptic drink until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven.
In the purification of boys and treatment of their errors.
Circumcision is nothing other than separating a connection, like other surgeries.  However, since it is a deliberate act of ours, and particularly used in boys, we must establish the best procedure.
And the easiest path to safety. I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because it was not used in their rites, but it is something we have acquired.
Through experience. I have found that the majority of craftsmen and barbers use cleansing with a knife, scissors, a cautery iron, ligature with thread, and incision with a lancet. I have tried all these methods.
Therefore, I have found nothing better than cleansing with scissors and ligating with thread, because cleansing with a knife often causes the skin to be damaged.  The skin of the foreskin has two layers; perhaps the upper layer is cut while the lower layer remains.
One is then forced to make another cut, causing further pain. Cleansing with a cautery iron does not prevent cutting the end of the urethra, as it might enter its opening.  Cleansing with a lancet might cause the skin to tear, spoiling your work, or the boy's foreskin might be naturally too short.
Often, such children do not require cleansing, and I have seen this.  Cleansing with scissors and ligation with thread, however, experience has shown me to be superior, because the scissors cut evenly, with the blade on top similar to the blade on the bottom.
When you squeeze your hand with the blades aligned, the cut is uniform and simultaneous.  This makes the ligature like a wall on all sides of the urethral skin, with no mistake at all.  First, the procedure involves calming the boy.
Especially if he is somewhat intelligent, explain that you are only tying the thread around his urethra and leaving it for another day. Then, make him happy and pleased in any way you can, and according to what his mind accepts. Afterwards, stop him in front of you, standing tall.
Do not let him sit; hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot.  Do not let the boy see them or any tools.  Then, insert your hand into his urethra and inflate the foreskin, lifting it up until the glans is exposed.
Then, cleanse it of any dirt that has collected there.  Tie a double-threaded knot at the marked spot.  Then, tie a second knot a little lower.  Then, hold the lower knot firmly with your thumb and index finger and cut between the two knots. Then, quickly lift the foreskin upward and expose the glans. Let the blood flow a little, as this is better for reducing urethral swelling. Then, dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle it with powdered, burnt, dried pumpkin rind, as this is the best I have tried, or with the flour of the *ḥawārī*  seed, which is also excellent.
Then, quickly lift the foreskin upward and expose the glans. Let the blood flow a little, as this is better for reducing urethral swelling. Then, dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle it with powdered, burnt, dried pumpkin rind, as this is the best I have tried, or with the flour of the *ḥawārī*  seed, which is also excellent. Then, apply a poultice made of a crushed hard-boiled egg in rosewater, mixed with soft, fragrant rose oil, to the area, wrapped in a linen cloth. Leave it on for another day. Then, continue treatment with other methods until healed.
This is a suitable scissor design for the procedure.
The scissors should be straight, sharp, and nail-shaped, with the blades the same length as the handles.  A common error in the procedure is that the inner skin may be completely or partially inverted during the cut.  In this case, you should gently spread it using your fingernail before the area swells.
Cut it [the skin] straight. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days pass and the area under the glans is still swollen and inflamed, leave it until the hot swelling subsides, and then carefully dissect it.
Cut it as best you can, being careful around the glans.  If any part of the glans is cut, this does not harm it. Treat it using the poultices described in the article on poultices.
If more skin is cut than necessary and it retracts upwards, this also is not very harmful. Treat it as described until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-eight.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage by a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or grown flesh, and similar things.  If you treat it with the types of remedies described in the classifications.
If the urine does not flow and you suspect the retention is due to a stone that has damaged the neck of the bladder, the patient should be placed on their knees, then one leg should be placed on the patient's back and the patient's stomach pressed against the back.  The patient should hold themselves as tightly as possible.
The neck of the bladder will then be forced to push the stone backward, allowing the urine to flow. If the urine does not flow by the method described and the patient's condition worsens, then extraction with the instrument called a catheter, of which this is the image:, should be used.
It is made of silver, thin and smooth, hollow like a bird's feather tube, about one and a half spans in length.  It has a gentle funnel at its head.  To draw the urine with it, a doubled thread with a piece of wool or cotton tied firmly to its end should be used.
The thread's end is inserted into the lower portion of the catheter, and any excess wool is trimmed using pliers, so that it enters the tube and closes it like a button. Then, the catheter is lubricated with oil, butter, or egg white, and the patient sits on a chair.
The bladder and urethra are moistened with soft ointments or lukewarm oil and water. Then, the catheter is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra.  The urethra is then bent upward towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed further inside.
Once the urethra is bent, the catheter is pushed further inside until it nears the anus. The penis is then tilted downwards, the catheter inside, and it is pushed until it reaches the bladder, where the patient will feel it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this manner because the channel through which the urine passes is curved.  Pulling the thread with the wool slightly tightens it, causing the urine to follow the wool.  Then, the wool is removed, the urine is drained, and the catheter is withdrawn.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Images of the instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or carved ivory, hollowed out with a long tube for the purpose of dripping in fluids and medications. This is done with an instrument called a syringe.  This is its image.
Made of silver or ivory, hollowed out, with a long tube. The entire thing is hollow except for the end, which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollow part, where the projectile is, should be exactly the size that fits it without any excess.  So, when you pull on it, any moisture is drawn in, and when you push, it is pushed out, just as the oil-launching device, used in naval warfare, does.
If you want to remove moisture from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull upward with the plunger.  The moisture will be drawn into the syringe.  Then, insert the tip into the urethra, as we described for catheters, and push the moisture out with the plunger.
This moisture will reach the bladder, and the patient will feel it. This is also an image of a gentle enema for treating the bladder.
It is made of silver or leather.  Its top resembles a small funnel, and below it is a groove that holds the ligature.  Then, a camel's bladder is taken, and the moisture you want to inject into the bladder is placed inside.  Then, it is tied securely between the two parts using a doubled thread.
Heat the moisture slightly over a fire.  Then, insert the tip of the enema into the urethra.  Then, press firmly on the bladder containing the moisture until the patient feels it has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of thin material, make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around.  Then, insert a strong thread securely through each hole, as you go around.  Then, gather the circle as you would gather a tablecloth, after placing inside it the moisture, ointments, or water you want.
Then tie it to the instrument, and use it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On removing the stone.
We have previously described the types of stones, their medicinal treatment, and the differences between kidney stones and bladder stones, along with their symptoms. We also discussed stones requiring manual removal and incision.
This concerns specifically bladder stones, and those that form in the urethra.  I will describe this clearly and concisely.
I say that bladder stones most commonly affect boys.  A sign of this is that the urine is expelled from the bladder like thin water.
Sand appears, he rubs and plays with his penis, and often it hangs down.  Then the anus also becomes apparent in many of them.  Boys recover easily from this up to the age of fourteen.  It is difficult in the elderly, and for young men it is intermediate between these two.
Those with larger stones have easier treatment, and the opposite is true for smaller ones.  If we are to discuss the treatment, first the patient must be given an enema to remove all the filth in his intestines, since it may obstruct examination of the stone.
Then, the patient is held by his feet and shaken downward to bring the stone to the neck of the bladder, or he is made to jump from a high place several times.  Then, he is seated upright before you, with his hands beneath his thighs, so that the entire bladder is tilted downward, and then it is examined.
And you feel for it from the outside. If you feel the stone in the space, immediately make a cut on it.  If it does not come into contact with your touch at all, you should then smear the index finger with grease from the left hand, if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If it is a fully developed boy, you insert it into his rectum and search for the stone.  Once you locate it under your finger, move it gradually toward the neck of the bladder.  Then press on it with your finger and push it outward toward the place where you intend to make the incision.
You instruct one servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and another servant to stretch the labia upward with his right hand, and with his other hand to stretch the skin beneath the labia toward the location of the incision. Then take the grooved probe, which has this shape:
Make the incision between the rectum and the labia, not in the center but to the side of the left groin.  The incision should be directly on the stone, with your finger in the rectum, pushing it outward, obliquely, so that the incision is wide from the outside and narrow from the inside, to the extent possible for the stone to exit.
Do not use excessive force.  Perhaps the finger in the rectum will push the stone out easily during the incision.  Know that some stones have angles and edges, making their removal difficult.
Some are smooth, like acorns, and round, making them easy to remove.  Those with angles and edges should increase the incision slightly. If this does not work, devise a method to grasp them with a firm forceps, the tip of which is like a rasp.
To hold the stone firmly, so it does not slip.  Or, introduce a slender, curved instrument beneath it.  If these methods fail, widen the incision slightly.  If there is excessive bleeding, stop it with a cauterizing agent.
If there are multiple stones, first remove the largest into the bladder opening, then incise beside it.  Afterward, remove the smaller ones.  Do the same if there are more than two.  If the stones are very large, it would be unwise to make a large incision, as this could lead to one of two outcomes for the patient.
Either he will die, or he will have constant dribbling of urine because the area will never heal properly.  However, try to push it out.  Or, devise a method to break it using forceps so that it can be removed in pieces.
Once you have finished, treat the wound with kandar, sabr, shiyan, and shiddeh.  Place a bandage soaked in oil and a drink or rose ointment and cool water over it to calm the inflammation.  Then, the patient should lie on their back, and do not loosen the bandage for three days.
Once it heals, wash the area with plenty of water and oil.  Then treat it with nukhali and basilcon ointments until it is healed.  If an excessive, inflamed swelling or ulceration appears at the wound, or if blood coagulates in the bladder, obstructing urination, this is recognized by the presence of blood in the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove the blood.  If it remains, it will cause the bladder to decay and become infected.  Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of problem with a corresponding remedy until healed.
Throughout the treatment, the thighs should be bound together to hold the remedies applied to the area in place.  If the stone is small and lodged in the urethra, causing inflammation and obstructing urination, treat it as described previously before it reaches the rupture stage.
Often, this treatment obviates the need for incision.  I have tested this, and it involves using a hooked instrument of tempered steel, with the following form/shape:
The tip is triangular and sharp, fitted to a handle. Then, take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder.  Then, carefully insert the hooked instrument into the urethra until the hook reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the hook gently on the stone, gradually aiming to pierce it from the other side.  Urine will flow immediately.  Then, firmly grasp the remaining stone outside the penis, and it will break apart and exit with the urine. The patient will recover.
If this method proves impossible due to an obstacle, tie a thread below the stone and another above the stone. Then, make an incision on the stone in the same area of the penis between the two threads, and remove it.
Then, loosen the threads and clean the clotted blood from the wound.  The thread was tied below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other thread was tied above to ensure, after the stone has been removed and the thread is loosened, the skin returns to its proper place, covering the wound.
Therefore, when tying the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter Sixty-one.
On removing stones in women.
Stones rarely develop in women.  If one of them presents with a stone, treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons, one being that the woman may be a virgin, and the other that you cannot find a woman who will allow herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or of those with close relations, and the third that you do not find a woman who excels in this craft, especially manual work, and the fourth that the opening for the stone in women is far from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision.
And there is danger in that; if necessity demands it, a skilled female physician should be sought, though such are rare. If not found, seek a virtuous, compassionate male physician, or a skilled female midwife or someone knowledgeable in this craft to assist.
She should be present and instructed to perform all the examinations of the stone first.  If the woman is a virgin, the finger should be inserted into her vagina to examine for the stone.  If found, it should be pressed against the finger.
If she is not a virgin but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and applying gentle pressure.
If the stone is found, it should be guided from the bladder opening downward to the extent possible, until it reaches the root of the thigh, then an incision should be made in the vagina, halfway down to the root of the thigh, from whichever side the stone is felt to be located.
Her finger should remain on the stone, pressing against it.  The incision should initially be small.  Then, the instrument should be inserted into the small incision. If the stone is felt, the incision should be enlarged as needed to remove the stone.  Be aware that there are many types of stones.
There are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and branched stones.  Recognize the types to determine the appropriate action. If bleeding is excessive, apply powdered alum to the area and hold it for an hour until bleeding stops, then resume the procedure.
Until the stone is removed. Prepare the instruments for removing stones from men to assist in your work.  If bleeding is excessive and you know the bleeding is from a severed artery, apply a ligature to the area.
Tighten the ligature firmly and leave it in place; do not readjust it. Leave the stone; do not try to remove it.  The patient may die.  Then treat the wound.  If the severity of the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area becomes infected, return to your work until the stone is removed.
Chapter Sixty-two.
In the fissure on the watery ducts.
The watery ducts are a collection of moisture in the white peritoneum beneath the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle.  It may be in a special membrane prepared by nature in one area of the testicle.
So that one might think it another testicle, and it exists between the scrotum's skin and the white peritoneum, which we mentioned.  This only occurs rarely.  This watery duct arises from weakness in females, where this substance accumulates.  Or it can occur from a blow to the scrotum.
This moisture comes in various colors: yellow, blood-red, dark-brown, or white and watery, the latter being most common.  The signs by which it is recognized are...
Where the water collects, if it's in the white peritoneum we mentioned, the swelling will be somewhat oblong, like an egg, and the testicle will not be visible, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a separate membrane, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, one might imagine it to be another testicle.  If the moisture is between the scrotum's skin and the peritoneum, it can be felt.  To determine the moisture's color, probe the swelling with the square probe, as previously illustrated.  Judge its color by what comes out when the probe is withdrawn.
If we move to treatment with leeches, the patient should be bled, if possible, and if the body is full, they should lie on their back, slightly elevated on a raised surface with many cloths underneath.  You should then sit on their left side.
Have a servant sit on their right side, extending their penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the lower abdomen. Then, take a wide scalpel and cut the scrotum lengthwise from the middle, towards the pubic area.
The incision should be made in a straight line parallel to the line dividing the scrotum in half, until it reaches the white peritoneum.  Carefully separate it, avoiding cutting it.  Make the separation more thorough on the side attached to the testicle, and extend the separation as far as possible.
Then, widely separate the water-filled peritoneum, removing all the water.  Then, using forceps, separate the edges of the incision and stretch the peritoneum upwards, avoiding touching the scrotal skin. Cut the peritoneum as much as possible, either in one piece or in sections.
Especially the thinner part, for if you do not completely sever it, you cannot be sure the water will not return.  If the testicle emerges from its skin while you are working, replace it and then suture the edges of the scrotal skin together.
Then treat it as you would any other surgical wound until it heals. If the testicle has been damaged by a pre-existing condition, you should tie off the vessels in the suspensory ligament to prevent bleeding, then detach the testicle from the ligament, remove the testicle, and treat it as described previously.
If the accumulated fluid is present on both sides, know that it is a double hernia.  Incise the other side in the same manner as the first. If you prefer, perform the procedure on one side only.  Then, wipe away the blood.
Place wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions.  Place another layer of wool soaked in a mixture of wine and oil over the testicles and the abdominal wall, and put a folded cloth (the _rafa'id_) on top. Tie it down from above with the six-sided bandage in this manner:
Then, take two cloths, sew them together, and fill them with fluffy wool, like this example. Make the straps for tying from damp cotton or wool, gather them with a tight drawstring at the waist, and one strap will be taken from the seat to the back.
The second strap will be taken towards the pubic area, and the two remaining straps will be placed on the thighs from below, and the other two on the hips. Gather all the straps together at the waist.  This hernia can also be treated with cauterization instead of incision with an iron.
This involves taking a gentle, knife-like cautery iron and cutting the scrotum skin while it is heated, as described, until the white membrane containing water is exposed.  Take another cautery iron in this manner:
It resembles a Greek eye, then cauterize that membrane with it while it is hot, until all moisture is expelled.  Then, using forceps, pull the membrane and cauterize the layer containing it, cutting it as best as possible to completely remove it, keeping the testicle from being burned.
Know that this method is safer and less prone to blood loss than the incision method.  If, during the incision or cauterization, you encounter a burning tumor, blood loss, or anything else, you should treat each obstacle with the appropriate remedy as previously described.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot endure this procedure due to its unpleasantness, then use cauterization as described, if it is appropriate according to the evidence presented previously.
If the discharge is watery, the patient should sit on a high chair. Then cauterize the tumor underneath with a wide probe.  Make the cauterization along the body, with a wide opening, so that all the water drains out. Then apply cotton to the area and bind it.
Allow the remaining water to drain, then treat it until the wound heals.  If the water doesn't drain during the cauterization, it is because the white membrane is obstructing the wound opening, preventing the water from exiting.
In that case, you should insert a goose feather, or the instrument for extracting water from affected areas (a previously described tool), into the wound, or slightly enlarge the wound opening.
Know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so.  If it does, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should stay in treatment for the time being.
Chapter Sixty-three.
On the incision of fleshy swellings and their treatment.
Know that incising these swellings is often a perilous act, leading to death in most cases. Therefore, we recommend leaving them alone and avoiding injury.  I will now discuss the procedures for dealing with them, and the types of tumors.
I say that many tumors can occur in the body parts that have a double structure.  This may arise from various causes, either from a sharp, concentrated substance that flows into the dual structure, or from a blow. The tumor's color is the same as the body's color, and there is no fluid in it.
The tumor is firm, and sometimes it becomes hard and dark in color, without sensitivity.  It may also be due to the entanglement and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from swelling of the veins.  If it is from arterial swelling, this can be identified by the tumor's dispersal.
If you press it with your fingers, it will not give way; one should not attempt incisions at all.  If it is caused by venous swelling, nothing will disperse when pressed with the fingers.  This type can be incised along with the surrounding flesh.
This involves incising the scrotum, then pulling the testicle upward and removing it from the white peritoneum.  The attachments to the vessels should be freed, the vessels tied, and the attachments cut after freeing it from the testicle on all sides.  If the testicle has fused with the surrounding tissue growths.
Then the testicle should be removed and cut. If the adhesion is between parts of the peritoneum or between the vessels, all of this adhesion must be freed and cut in a circular manner.
If the tissue growth is located behind the point of attachment, then all of it should be cut, and the testicle removed, as we said.  Once this is completed, dress the wound with moist wool in rose-scented ointment and drink, then treat it with further remedies until it heals.
Sixty-fourth Chapter.
On the treatment of dropsy with dropsy.
Dropsy is a swollen, twisted tumor, resembling a cluster, with relaxation of the limbs.  It hinders the patient's movement, exercise, and walking.  In treating this affliction, the approach is similar to that previously mentioned.
However, one must follow the practice of the ancients.  I say that the patient should sit on a high chair, then pull the lower limbs downwards.  Then, grasp the scrotum skin with your fingers, along with the vessels near the penis.
A servant of yours should hold it and pull it sharply.  Then, with a wide, sharp scalpel, make an oblique incision next to the vessels until they are exposed.  Then, dissect from every side, as I described for the arteries in the temples.  Then, insert a needle with a doubled thread into it.
Tie it at the first points where the dropsy appeared, and also at its end.  Then, make a vertical incision down the length of the body in the middle, and remove the accumulated impure, corrupt fluids.
Then treat the wound as other surgical wounds would be treated, allowing time for healing. Removing the vessels feeding one limb is acceptable. If the dropsy affects all the vessels, one limb with the vessels must be removed, lest the testicle be starved of nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, it will wither and be useless.
Chapter Sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal dropsy.
This dropsy occurs when a rupture appears in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen near the groin.  The intestines protrude from that hernia into one of the testicles.
This hernia may result either from a rupture of the peritoneum or from its stretching.  These two types arise from numerous causes, such as a blow, a leap, a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and so forth.  The sign of a hernia from stretching of the peritoneum is that it develops gradually over a long period of time.
It does not occur suddenly.  If from stretching, the swelling gradually grows deeper, because the peritoneum compresses the intestines.  If from a rupture, the hernia is accompanied by intense pain initially, and the swelling will be visible under the skin nearby.
The intestines protrude, escaping from the peritoneum.  Pus may also be expelled with the intestines, making this a combined intestinal and purulent dropsy.  It may also contain air, or the intestines may accumulate faeces and become obstructed, leading to the patient's demise.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially when compressed.  Treatment for these types of ailments with iron is dangerous, so one should avoid it.  The procedure is to instruct the patient to return the intestines into their abdominal cavity with their hand if possible.
Then, the patient should lie on their back with you present, and their legs should be raised.  The skin around the groin is then pulled upwards, and the entire scrotal skin is incised lengthwise.  Hooks are inserted into the edges of the incision, as much as needed, to widen the opening.
The incision should be large enough to allow the testicle to protrude.  Then, the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin should be dissected until the white, firm peritoneum is exposed completely.  At that point, insert your index finger below the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum underneath the testicle's skin and the second peritoneum, detach the adhesions behind the testicle.  Then, with your right hand, draw it inward toward the scrotal skin, while pulling the white peritoneum upwards with your left hand, lifting the testicle and peritoneum towards the incision.
You instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upwards, and you completely detach the adhesions behind it.  Use your finger to search for any twisted intestines within the firm white peritoneum.  If you find any, push them back into the abdomen below.
Then take a needle with a thick, ten-stranded thread, and insert it at the edge of the peritoneum underneath the scrotal skin near the incision. Then, cut the ends of the thread until only four strands remain. Then, intertwine the strands, and tie the peritoneum, which we mentioned is beneath the scrotal skin, tightly on both sides. Then, also wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that no blood vessels reaching it can penetrate. To prevent a hot swelling from forming, also make a second ligature outside the first, at least two finger-widths away. After these two ligatures, leave an amount of peritoneum under the scrotal skin equal to the width of a finger.
To prevent a hot swelling from forming, also make a second ligature outside the first, at least two finger-widths away. After these two ligatures, leave an amount of peritoneum under the scrotal skin equal to the width of a finger. Cut the rest completely around, and remove the testicle.  Then, make a cut under the scrotal skin, one that bleeds and oozes as previously described.  Then, use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and apply the ligature as we described.
The white peritoneum, which we mentioned after cutting, may be cauterized cautiously to prevent bleeding, as this often happens.  Leave the ligature until it falls off on its own. If it is slow to fall off, then soak it in hot water and apply something that causes perspiration, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with all other surgical treatments until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-six.
In this type of colic, I have seen no one dare to treat it with iron.  The ancients mentioned that it should be treated as described for colic with a pouch, i.e., the vessels are to be tied gently after incision beneath.
Then cut open the middle and treat the swelling to open it until the vessels fall out, and treat the wound as we described until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-six.
In the hernia which is in the groin.
The hernia in the groin may appear, as we said, bulging the area, but no bowel descends into the groin. If it does descend, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if it persists for a long time, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestines and testicles descend into the scrotum.  This results from the extension of the peritoneum in the groin, as we said. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes, and the area bulges.  Treatment is by cauterization, as its description was previously given.
Treatment may also be with an instrument, in the following manner: the patient lies on their back before you.  Then, the bulging, protruding hernia area is cut across, about the width of three fingers.  Then, the peritonea beneath the skin are grasped.
Until the white peritoneum beneath it is exposed. Then, you take a thread and place it on the bulging part of the peritoneum, pressing it back into the abdomen.  Then you stitch the two bulging areas together, one to the other, along the edge of the thread.
Then, remove the thread. Do not cut the peritoneum at all, or touch the testicle or anything else, as I instructed you in the treatment of intestinal protrusions. Then treat it with the treatments for surgical procedures.
If the threads are severed, cleanse and close the wound until it heals. The peritoneum will contract and the hernia will not increase.
And this is the better method, as it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-eight.
Relaxation of the scrotum skin.
The scrotum skin often relaxes in some people without the underlying tissues relaxing, making the appearance unattractive.  Therefore, whoever wishes to treat this should have the patient lie on their back.
Cut all the relaxed skin away from the tough skin, then bring the edges together. If you wish, first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, securing the stitches, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the usual surgical treatment until it heals and the stitches are removed.
Chapter Sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, I should not have mentioned it in this book. However, I have mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that a physician will know it if asked, and understand how to treat a person who has undergone it; and two, we often need to castrate certain animals for our benefit.
Like sheep, camels, and cats, and similar animals.  I say that castration can be done in two ways: either by crushing or by cutting.  For crushing, we place the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer discernible to the touch.  As for castration by cutting, one should hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the ligaments and make a single incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles emerge, then cut them off after peeling them, leaving nothing of the membranes except the thin membrane surrounding the vessels. This method of castration is better than that which involves crushing.
Because crushing might leave some of the testicles, causing the animal to desire mating.  Then treat the wound until it heals.
Seventy-seventh chapter.
In the treatment of hermaphrodites.
The hermaphrodite in men comes in two types. One appears as a space or on the scrotal skin, between the testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva with hair. Urine may flow from the part located on the scrotal skin.
As for women, there is one type, occurring above the vulva on the pubis, like small, protruding man's testicles. One of them resembles a man's penis, and both are like female parts.  The treatment for these three types.
The two types of men and the single type of women, the excess flesh must be cut away until the wound heals, then treated with the treatment of other wounds until healed.  As for the second type of men from whom urine issues from the scrotal skin, there is no work to be done, and no healing at all.
Chapter seventy-one.
In the excision of the clitoris and the protruding flesh of women's vulvas.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond the natural limit, becoming unsightly and deformed.  In some women, it may enlarge to the extent of resembling a male organ, interfering with sexual intercourse.
Therefore, grasp the excess clitoris with your hand or forceps and cut it off, but do not make the cut too deep, especially not into the base, lest excessive bleeding result.
Then treat it with surgical procedures until it heals.  As for the protruding flesh, it is flesh that grows in the vaginal opening, filling it up.
And perhaps it protrudes externally, like a tail. Therefore, some ancient physicians called it the "tail disease".  It should be cut off, just as the clitoris is cut, and treated until healed.
Chapter Seventy-two.
On the treatment of ruptures.
Rupture is when a woman's vagina is not perforated or the perforation is small, and it is either natural, born with it, or accidental.  The accidental case arises from a prior cause and may be due to excessive tissue growth.
or thin or thick peritoneum, located either deep within the uterus, or on its sides, or at the top or bottom.  It prevents intercourse, conception, childbirth, and possibly menstruation.  A midwife can ascertain this through observation.
If the obstruction is visible and close by, but not visible, she should probe with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is thin peritoneum and close to the labia, then proceed with puncturing it—making incisions resembling incisions on the labia, and then place both thumbs of the hands together.
The woman should lie on her back with her legs apart.  Then, forcefully spread the labia until the thin peritoneum is punctured and the obstruction opens.  Then, she should take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. The woman should engage in sexual intercourse every day so that the area does not close up again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, it should be cut open with a broad scalpel, resembling a thin leaf. If the obstruction is from overgrown flesh, it should be suspended by forceps and cut off. Have medications for stopping bleeding without causing punctures on hand, such as qaqia, shiyan, and frankincense mixed with egg whites.
Then a wide lead tube should be used so the wound does not close quickly.  Hold it for days and use a dry linen wick. Then treat with the standard treatment for abscesses until healed.  There may be other fleshy growths within the uterus, which should be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous growth, the cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear in the female genitalia.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the veins' openings, causing a constant flow of copious blood.  If hemorrhoids advance, they become warts.  We have previously mentioned their types, signs, and we will discuss them here.
Of those that can be treated and those that cannot be treated, I say that hemorrhoids and warts that are deep within the uterus and not felt externally have no cure with iron. Those that are in the mouth of the uterus, which can be felt, are the ones that are treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, then scrape the warts with a lancet or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.  After the blood flow from one of the blood-stopping tools, without pricking, apply it.
Such as qaqia, sheyan, and frankincense, and similar things.  Then raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cool water. If the bleeding continues, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, and astringents, and similar things. Then, take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
Apply this to her back. If the bleeding stops, stop. Otherwise, apply leeches to the abdomen, breasts, without condition.  Then, take wool, dip it in the juice of thistle, or the juice of goat's rue, or the juice of the branches of the willow, along with astringent drink, and apply it to the affected area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until healed.  As for the red sore, resembling the heads of pustules, rough in appearance, you should cut away what is visible from it, in the same way as warts, and treat it until healed.
Chapter seventy-four.
On treating abscesses that appear in the uterus.
Many types of tumors, such as cancer, hard tumors, ulcers, gangrene, the eating ulcer, warts, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors, may appear in the uterus.  All of these diseases and their types and signs are mentioned in the classification.
We should mention in this article the hot tumor that appears in the uterus, if it is one of the tumors that accumulate for a period, how to treat it with iron.  Therefore, one must observe. If the pain of the tumor in its beginning is severe, with throbbing, inflammation, and fever...
If you see it red, and if it is sensitive to touch, do not rush to treat it with cauterization. Treat it with what aids maturation until these symptoms subside. Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean on her back.
And bring her legs towards the lower abdomen, and let her thighs be spread apart.  Her arms should be placed below her knees and bound with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the cervix is opened, a depiction of which will follow later.  If you wish to use this instrument, you must estimate the depth of the woman's uterus so that what enters from the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
For if the instrument is deeper than the depth, it will harm the patient. Therefore, pads should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus. The spiral that runs within the instrument should be on the upper side.
Holding the instrument, the attendant turns the spiral until the cervix opens.  If the abscess is apparent, and it is felt by hand to be soft and thin, it should be incised at its head with a broad scalpel. When the entire discharge has been expelled.
A soft wick, dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent, should be placed in the wound. The wick should protrude from the incision in the cervix.  Clean wool, dipped in boiled water with baking soda, should be placed externally, on the uterus and pubis.
Then, after two days, treat with the appropriate ointment until healed.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water in which the root of the sassafras or long zira is boiled. Then return to the ointment. This is if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
Avoid treating it with iron.  Instead, treat as described in the classification.
Chapter seventy-five.
On instructing midwives on how to treat living fetuses that emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the natural form of childbirth.  Signs include the woman's leaning forward, her longing to breathe the air, and the lessening of her postpartum discomfort.
And if the delivery of the fetus is quick, know that this birth is in the natural form, with the head exiting first and the placenta either with it or hanging from its navel.  If you see these signs, you should massage her abdomen to expedite the delivery of the fetus.
If it emerges head first, the placenta will descend with it, and it should be cleaned thoroughly of any impurities. Any birth that differs from this is unnatural and blameworthy, as the fetus may emerge on its feet, with its hands or feet appearing before its head.
And one hand or one foot, or its head and hand, or it emerges curled, or perhaps turned on its back, and similar undesirable forms.  The midwife must be skilled and gentle in dealing with all these things, avoiding errors and mistakes.
And I am describing each form and how to handle it so you may recognize it.  If the fetus emerges headfirst, in the natural way, and the woman's labor intensifies, becoming difficult, and you see her strength weakening, seat her in a chair and order women to restrain her.
Bind her uterus with boiled linseed and moist ointments. Then, the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers to cut the placenta, or cut it with her fingernail, until the moisture inside it flows out.  Massage the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be injected with linseed saliva mixed with shiraj ointment.  Then, after the injection, instruct her to cough and use the kneading stick to make her sneeze, and hold her mouth and nose.  The fetus will emerge at that time. If the fetus's hands emerge first, then gently push them back, little by little.
If entry is not possible, place the woman on a raised platform and lift her legs upward. Then shake the platform on the ground, while the woman holds on so she does not fall during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them out gently. It will come out.  If the fetus emerges on its feet, then push its feet upwards, then turn the fetus slightly, little by little, until it is straightened out, then take one of its feet and pull it out gently, little by little.
If they emerge to the thighs, tell her to cough and make her sneeze with the kneading stick; it will come out. If it does not come out as described, then push the fetus back slightly, little by little, until it is in the natural position, then it will come out smoothly. If it still resists all these methods...
Take some saliva from the *khatmi* plant, linseed saliva, shiraj ointment, and dissolved frankincense. Grind all of them well in a mortar. Then apply it to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen. Then have her sit in lukewarm water until it reaches the ankles.
If you see that it has softened beneath, make her a pessary of myrrh and have her tolerate it. If she keeps the pessary for an hour, have her sit on a chair, then make her sneeze, and block her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen. The fetus will come out immediately; the fetus emerges on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, gently insert your hands little by little. Then, the woman lies on her back, her thighs hanging down while lying on a bed, and she clasps her hands.  Then, gently press on top of her abdomen little by little. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her legs are positioned lower. If the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously. Then press gently on top of the ankles little by little, to bring the fetus upwards. Then the midwife inserts her hand and straightens the fetus little by little.
Tell the woman to strain so the fetus emerges.  The fetus emerges sideways, with one arm hanging down.  Carefully attempt to reposition the arm. If you cannot reposition it, have the woman stand up and walk. If she cannot walk, have her lie down.
Shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice described from saliva. If it is delivered, have her sit on a chair and carefully reposition the arm and straighten the fetus to its normal form. Make the woman sneeze and tell her to strain until it is delivered.
If the fetus emerges on its back, with arms outstretched and face towards the mother's back, the midwife should grasp the fetus's arm and gently turn and straighten it. Once straightened, apply the fats and saliva as described previously.
Then have her move slowly.  When she does, have her sit on a chair and instruct her to lean to her right side.  Then have her strain and make her sneeze with a small instrument, for this will help it emerge. The fetus emerges upright on its side.
If it descends to the cervix in this manner, with the placenta, cut the placenta with your fingernail until the moisture is released.  If it is attached to the fetus's face and neck, cut it from the navel so it doesn't suffocate and die.  Then push the fetus inside until it is in the correct position.
Tell the woman to strain repeatedly, and it will emerge easily.  For the delivery of twins or multiple fetuses, know that twins frequently are born, and three or four may be born and survive, though this is rare.  Five is beyond nature and they will not survive.
And they are surrounded by a single placenta, even if numerous, and are separated by a membrane dividing them, attached to the navel of each.  They may emerge like a single fetus, naturally and easily, or they may emerge in a difficult manner, as we have described.
If any of them are difficult to deliver and take on unnatural forms, treat them as we have described.  Let the midwife be gentle and do everything with care and patience, and find a way for each form using whatever method brings safety.
It is possible for one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten fetuses to form in the womb, and I have been informed of a woman who miscarried seven and another who miscarried fifteen, all conceived.
By the decree of the Exalted and Omniscient, all of this should be within the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a thing will befall her someday and she will know how to handle it properly.
Chapter Sixty-seven.
In the removal of the dead fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus with the methods of treatment described in the section and it has not been expelled, and you are forced to use manual intervention, you should observe the following: if the woman is healthy and has no symptoms that cause concern about her suffering damage, she should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be tilted downward, her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body does not move when the fetus is drawn out.
Then, the mouth of her uterus should be moistened with moist ointments, along with the saliva of the *khatmi* plant, fenugreek, and flax seeds.  The midwife then anoints her hand with these ointments and saliva, and gently inserts it into the uterus.  Then, she should look for a place to insert the hooks, targeting the appropriate areas of the fetus.
If the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, insert the hooks into its eyes, nape, mouth, palate, under its chin, clavicle, areas near the ribs, or beneath the collarbones.
And if it is descending feet first, into the pubic area and the middle ribs.  The hook should be held in the right hand, its curve positioned between the fingers of the left hand, and the hand should be inserted gently, driving a hook into one of the locations previously mentioned.
Until it reaches an empty space, then a second or third hook is inserted opposite it, to ensure an even pull, and not favoring one direction.  The pulling should be even and not simply in a straight line, but rather moving in all directions.
So that it may come out easily, as is done with a tooth when extracted.  In between, the pulling should be relaxed.  If it becomes obstructed in one area, the midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them to rotate whatever is obstructed.  If some part of the fetus comes out, the hooks should be moved to other locations.
She [the midwife] should do this slightly higher, until the entire fetus is expelled. If a hand emerges before the rest, and cannot be repositioned due to compression, it should be wrapped in a cloth, then pulled out.  Once the whole thing is out, cut it.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.  Similarly, this should be done with the other hand and feet.  If the fetal head is large and has difficulty exiting due to pressure, or if there is accumulated fluid in the head, a pointed scalpel should be inserted between the fingers.
With it [the scalpel], the head is split open to release the water, or it is ruptured with the instrument called the *mashdakh*, the image of which will appear with the images of other instruments in the subsequent chapter.
Likewise, if the fetus has a naturally large head, the skull should be split or ruptured with the *mashdakh*, as we mentioned.  Then the bones are extracted with forceps. If the head emerges and is compressed at the collarbone, it should be split to drain the moisture in the chest.
Then the chest will adhere. If the chest does not adhere and cannot be extracted, cut as much as possible. If there is a swelling or lump in the lower abdomen, it should be punctured to drain moisture.
If the fetus is on its feet, pulling it and aligning it to the cervix is easy. If it is compressed in the abdomen or chest, it should be pulled with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be split to drain the moisture inside.
If all the other organs have been removed and the head remains lodged, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the cervix is open, she should insert her hand into the cervix, locate the head, and pull it with her fingers toward the cervix.  Then insert a hook or two and pull it out with them.
If the cervix has adhered to a hot, swollen tumor, it should not be forced. Instead, moist, oily substances should be applied, compresses used, and sitting in relaxing, moist water is recommended.
If the fetus is on its side, if it can be straightened, the methods described for a living fetus should be used. If this is not possible, it should be cut and removed.  Absolutely nothing of the placenta should be left inside.  Once your treatment is complete, use the methods described for treating hot tumors in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, she should sit in astringent water and use other treatments.  I have witnessed a woman who conceived, then had a fetus die inside her, and subsequently conceived again.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a tumor appeared in her womb, swelling until it opened and discharged pus.  I was called to treat her, and treated her for a long time.  The wound did not close.  I then applied some strong, drawing ointments to it.
Then a bone emerged from the area.  Several days later, another bone came out.  I was amazed by this, as the abdomen does not contain bones.  I surmised that these were bones from the deceased fetus.  I probed the wound and removed many bones from the skull of the fetus.
I continued this procedure until I removed many bones, and the woman was in the best of health. She lived in this condition for a long time, with a small amount of pus discharging from the area. I have included this unusual case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts with his hands in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for extracting the fetus.
Image of a spiral for opening the cervix.
This ligature, with which books are bound, has two spirals at the ends of the planks.  However, this spiral should be gentler than the ligature, and should be either ebony or boxwood.  The width of each plank should be two finger-widths.
Their edges should be about a finger's width, and their length one and a half spans.  In the middle of the planks are two pegs of the same wood, to which they are fastened.  Their length is half a span, or slightly more, and their width about two fingers, or slightly more. These two pegs.
They are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the spirals.  Image of another instrument for this purpose, gentler and lighter.
Made of ebony or boxwood, in the shape of claws, but with two pegs at the tip, as you see.  The length of each peg is about a span, and their width is two fingers.  If you wish to open the cervix with it...
Place the woman on a bed with her legs spread apart between her thighs.  Then insert these two pegs, closed, into the cervix.  While holding the end of the instrument below between her thighs, open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with the claws, to the extent that you desire to open the cervix. So that the midwife can achieve what she wants.  Image of another spiral, mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument that expels the fetus.
Image of the instrument used to crush the fetal head.
It resembles scissors, having teeth at the tip, as you see.  It can also be made rectangular like forceps, with saw-like teeth to cut and sever, as you see.
Image of another instrument as well.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so as not to break when pulling the fetus with it.  Image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more types there are and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his standing among people.  Do not despise any instrument being prepared for you, as there will certainly be a need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In removing the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, one should instruct the woman to hold herself, then have her sneeze with a cupping instrument.  Press your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out this way, then do so. If not, take a measure [of something].
Pierce a hole in the cover, and place in it the herbs opening the cervix, such as fodenj, sedab, dill, chamomile, chih, sliha, and qanṭūriyun.  Place all of these, or some of them, in water and place it on the fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole of the pot's cover and the other end in the cervix.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then have her sneeze as we said.  The placenta will then come out quickly.  If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in the fat of a she-goat or in the saliva of the hawk.
Then, she should insert it into the [vaginal] passage and search for the placenta.  If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it out slowly, little by little.  If it is stuck deep within the uterus, insert the hand as described.  When the placenta is located, pull it out slowly and gently.
So that the uterus does not fall with a sudden pull, but it should be gently moved to the sides, right and left.  Then, the amount of pulling should be increased.  It will then respond and detach from the adhesion.  If the cervix is closed, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the pot and herbs treatment.
If it does not come out with all the methods described, avoid force when pulling again.  Instead, tie what has come out to the woman's thigh.  Then, inject her with the four-component ointment. It will cause it to fester after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out.  However, if it festers, a foul odor will ascend to the stomach and head, harming the patient.  Therefore, appropriate incense should be used.
Therefore, some early practitioners have tried the incense of frankincense and dried figs.  Here is a depiction of the device that is used to fumigate a woman when menstruation or the placenta is retained.
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or made of copper.  The narrow end is placed in the vagina, the wide end on the fire, and incense is placed on the embers. It is held until the incense is gone and replaced with more.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of the unperforated anus.
Many boys may be born with unperforated anuses, blocked by thin peritoneum.  The midwife should perforate this peritoneum with her finger, or otherwise, lance it with a sharp scalpel.  Care should be taken not to injure the muscle.
Then place on it wool dipped in wine and oil, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear it will close again, place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child desires to defecate.
A blockage of the anus may also result from a wound or tumor.  Such an abscess should be incised, then treated with the remedies mentioned previously and cauterized.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of warts that occur on the soles.
Warts that occur on the soles are a thickening and hardening that develops near the anus, either externally or within the surrounding space on one side, and may be one or more in number.
If this thickening persists, it may open and discharge a whitish watery fluid or thin pus.  Some of these warts may penetrate into the rectum and intestines.  Those that do not penetrate may be recognized by what comes out of them—faeces and wind—when using the bowel movements remedies.
And perhaps worms may come out of them. Some warts, if in the surrounding space, may penetrate into the bladder and urethra, or into the hip joint and sacrum.  A wart that penetrates the rectum may be recognized in the same way as one that does not penetrate.
Insert your index finger into the rectum and introduce a thin probe made of copper or iron into the wart. If the wart is not convoluted, then if there is a convolution, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair in your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing—no faeces, wind, or worms, as we said—emerges from the opening, then know that it is not penetrating, and proceed with treatment.
If the wart penetrates the bladder or urethra, the sign is the discharge of urine from it, and the inability of the affected area to heal with medications. If it penetrates the hip joint or sacrum, the sign is the probe reaching there.
If there is no twisting towards the bone, and pain is present in a certain area, with persistent pus discharge, and if treatment is ineffective and it does not heal with ointment, then these penetrating warts have no cure.
Treatment is futile for those who attempt to treat them, if they are ignorant physicians.  As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, there is hope for healing with iron, as I describe and have experienced.  The patient should lie on their back before you.
Raise the patient's legs and tilt their thighs towards their abdomen.  Then, if there is a twisting in the wart, insert a copper or lead probe until you ascertain where it ends. If the patient feels the probe near the buttock, you should insert your index finger into the buttock.
If you feel the probe has penetrated through your finger, exposed without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and the probe, then know for certain that it is penetrating.  Do not waste effort, for there is no cure for it, as we said.
They say that it heals in some people rarely.  A treatment that may be helpful is to heat a thin cautery iron, according to the size of the sore, as previously mentioned, and insert it into the sore until it reaches near the buttock, repeating this two or three times.
So that you know that all the excess, hardened flesh, resembling a bird's feather tube, has been burned. Then treat it with flax soaked in clarified butter, until the burned flesh is removed, and then treat it with healing ointments, if he heals.
Otherwise, it will not heal with any other treatment.  If, however, you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the buttock, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or membrane between the probe and your finger, and you see the sore is just beneath the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the sore. While passing through the incision with the probe inside the sore, extend the incision to where the probe tip ends.  The probe is then removed and falls out, and the hardened flesh, resembling a bird's feather tube, is thoroughly cleaned, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If blood prevents you from removing the flesh, the best and quickest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two beneficial conditions: burning away excess flesh.
And stop the bleeding, and dry the moisture. Then treat it with flax soaked in clarified butter or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until the area becomes suppurative and the burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of solid flesh.
These are medicines that have a binding and drying effect.  If the wound heals in this way, it is cured, and a return is not to be expected. If the sore has reached deep into the buttock and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the buttock and probe it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh, and it is close to the point of penetration, there is no course of action other than hope and expectation. This is to use one of three methods: either to cauterize it, as we have said.
Or to slit it until you reach its bottom, so you can easily insert flax and medicine from close to the area.  Do not make the slit too deep, lest you sever the muscle surrounding the buttock, causing the patient to involuntarily discharge stool. Then treat it as we have described, and perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or to pierce through that barrier and puncture it, after slitting it close to the buttock, as we said, either with a probe or another sharp-pointed instrument. Then, thoroughly cleanse all the accumulated flesh in the slit to the extent possible.
Then, treat the entire wound, including the slit and the upper opening, until it is closed, leaving the sore open inside the buttock, which will be less distressing for the patient.  The sore may heal in this manner.
If, when you insert the probe into the sore, it is located on one side of the buttock, near the surface of the body, with the skin and the rim of the buttock, then take a probe with a perforated tip, like a cobbler's awl, like this:
And insert a twisted thread of five threads or thereabouts into it.  Then, insert the probe with the thread into the sore until it reaches its bottom.  If it is perforated within the edge of the buttock from the inside, near it.
Then remove the thread from that perforation by inserting your finger into the buttock and pulling out the thread end.  Gather both ends together and tie them tightly. Leave it for a day or two.  Whenever the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it firmly until the flesh between the thread ends cuts off and falls away.  Then treat the wound until it heals and is completely recovered.
If the opening of the sore is not perforated, then perforate it however you can, except if it is very deep, for you should not do this because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then do with it as we described until it heals.
The shape of the lancet used to pierce sores should have a very sharp bend, and the other side should not be sharp, so as not to cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-One.
Concerning hemorrhoids that bleed, their cutting, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the anus, resembling red swellings or like grapes, and they may be small or large, and blood constantly flows from them.
They may be single or numerous, and they may be outside the anus, at its edges. However, those outside the anus are generally less moist; a yellowish or slightly bloody fluid constantly drips from them, and they are the same color as the body.
The treatment for those inside the anus is to instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the anus is stretched and the polyps are visible.  Then quickly grasp them with forceps or your fingernail and cut them at their roots, if the forceps cannot grip them due to their moisture and laxity.
Then, grasp it with a rough cloth or a piece of sharpened wood, or pull it out with your fingers, and then cut it. Afterwards, sprinkle some sharp powders over the cut to act as cautery, or cauterize it as described in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If the anus does not yield, administer an enema to the patient containing a little irritant to wash what is in the anus and encourage quick expulsion when the patient strains.  As for polyps outside the anus, their treatment is easy and simple.
To treat it, grasp it with your fingernail or forceps, cut it, then treat it with the methods mentioned until it heals.  If one dislikes cutting with metal, one should instead use a needle and thread.
Then, pull the polyp upward and pierce it with the needle at its root on the opposite side, wrap the ends of the thread around the needle, which is positioned across it, and firmly pull the polyp.  Tie the thread and remove the needle.  Do this with all the polyps, leaving one unpierced.
To cause the discharge of excess blood, then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or cypress oil on the anus, have the patient rest, and leave it until the polyps fall.  If the polyps fall, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often arise from dryness, and constipation. If they persist despite treatment, it is necessary to scrape them with a scalpel or fingernail until they become moist and the upper crust that prevents adhesion is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, scrape it more forcefully than before until it bleeds and peels, then treat it.  It will then heal.
The Eighty-second Chapter.
On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted nails, dry warts, and the nits.
The nail is a round lump the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, found throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and toes, causing pain when walking.
It is necessary to cut around the nail, grasp it with a pick or a hook and pull it from its root, then treat it.  If you wish, cauterize it as described in the relevant chapter.  As for dry warts, each is a small, rough, hardened, round protuberance on the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of children.  Treatment involves stretching the wart, cutting or piercing it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off. Or, if you wish, cauterize it as previously described, using fire or a potent medicine.
Inverted and non-inverted warts can be removed with the instrument I mentioned in the treatment of nits.  Nits are also a small, hardened, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, extending deep into it. If exposed to cold, a sensation resembling a stinging of ants will be felt in them.
They occur throughout the body, most often on the hands.  Treatment involves taking a tube of strong goose or eagle feather, placing the tube around the nit so that the tube encircles it completely, then turning your hand with the tube until you split the surrounding tissue.
Place it deep into the flesh and the nit will be pulled from its root.  If you wish, do this with a copper or iron tube, in this manner:
The top of the tube should be smooth and twisted, so that the fingers can easily hold and turn it. If you wish, cauterize the nit as previously described in the chapter on cauterization of warts.

Images of instruments used for injections in diseases of the rectum, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, or porcelain, or of hollow or hammered copper.  Smaller and larger versions of this instrument may be made, according to those who use them. The ones used to treat young children, or those with narrow or painful rectums, should be very gentle.  Image of a large syringe:.
The upper funnel where the tube is attached should be wide in this manner, with a barrier where the tube is attached, as you see. The lower tip that enters the rectum should be very smooth and polished, with two holes on one side and one hole on the other side.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a reed, or slightly thicker. The tube in which you place the medicine, made from an animal bladder or sheep's intestine, should be shaped like a small spoon, with a diameter of one span.
Pierce it with many holes, as if it were turning.  There should be a distance of a finger's width between each hole.  Then, thread a strong thread of doubled yarn, consisting of ten threads or so, through those holes to gather the tube together, like a spoon. When medicine is placed inside, tightly tighten the top of the syringe between the stones, then inject.  This is a diagram of the tube and its holes:.
To inject with it: fill the intestine or bladder with medication, warmed to the patient's tolerance.  Beware that it is not too hot or too cold.  Then, the patient should lie on their back with their legs raised.
A mat or blanket is placed underneath.  The tip of the syringe is then smeared with ointment, egg white, or licorice juice, or the like.  Gently insert it into the rectum. Then, the attendant holding the tube squeezes it firmly until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the intestines.
Then, the syringe is removed and the patient lowers their legs. If the medicine is prompted to exit, let them hold it as much as possible. If they sleep with it all night, it will be more effective in expelling. If it is used for diarrhea and rapid expulsion is desired, repeat the enema until healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the syringe must be very smooth, gentler than syringes used for children.  This is a diagram of a gentle syringe with its skin tightened:.
Chapter Eighty-four.
On the treatment of injuries.
I have previously discussed the treatment of conditions similar to burns in the classification.  Here, I will discuss their treatment with the hand and remedies in full detail.  I say that injuries vary according to the thing that causes the injury and the location of the wound.
The causes of injuries are numerous, such as a blow from a stone, a cut from a sword or knife, a spear or stick or arrow wound, and many other things.
Injuries vary according to location on the body, such as wounds on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and other organs.
I am describing the treatment of some injuries to make them a standard and rule for all other injuries. I will begin with simple head wounds, especially since compound wounds will be discussed in the first chapter of the third book of this text.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head, and is not a bone fracture, and if it was caused by a blow from a stone or similar object, and only the skin was bruised, and the wound was large, and you fear the occurrence of inflammation, then promptly lance the wound in situ. Do not delay this, and draw blood from him according to his strength, if there is no impediment to cupping, especially if the blood flowing from the wound is meager. Let the cupping be on the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinks, and heavy foods.  If there is an impediment to cupping, then let him reduce his intake of food, and avoid meat and drinks.  If a hot swelling develops on the wound, apply a cotton swab dipped in rose oil, alone or with a drink that has a binding effect.
If you are not afraid of inflammation, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh and still bleeding and the air has not changed it (the air that I will describe to you shortly), and if the air has changed it, then apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and caused by a sword cut or similar, and its edges have not joined, then bring them together with stitches, as described in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin has been peeled back from the bone and is only loosely attached, cut it away. Then treat the wound with medications that will cause the formation of strong flesh to replace the skin.  Instruct the patient to eat foods that promote strength, such as heads of animals and similar parts.
If there is gangrene in the skin, and it is not attached to the bone, then cut away all of the gangrene and dispose of it. Then treat it.  If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding, and the bleeding does not stop with medications, then search for the artery.
If you hit it and it does not stop, cut it off with the lancet and tie it off.  If the methods mentioned are not effective, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, treatment is easy; simply sprinkle this powder over them while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes it, the powder recipe is: one part frankincense, two parts gum resin, and three parts slaked or unslaked lime.  Grind them all together, sift, and fill the wound with it.  Tie it firmly so it adheres well.
It will clot with the blood, then bandage it from above with dressings. Leave it undisturbed as long as it doesn't swell.  The medicine will not be removed until it heals.  The lime alone can do this, if you do not have frankincense and gum resin.
This procedure can also be done with the lime in many larger wounds, if its application and bandaging are done correctly. This is for wounds that are fresh and bleeding, as long as they haven't been affected by air. However, if some air has altered them, especially if it's summertime.
Therefore, there is no effective use of this powder in this situation.  Treat it instead with the remedies mentioned previously, by applying some ripening ointments or a poultice made of barley flour, water, and honey until the pus is discharged, then treat with other remedies until healed.
However, if the wound includes a minor fracture of the bone, pull it out with a dry cloth.  The treatment for head fractures is discussed in the next section, in the chapter on neck injuries.  If the wound is in the neck, there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple head wound.
If a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treatments that constrict strongly, such as verdigris, alum, and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause spasms.
Absolutely no cold substance should be applied to the wound, because the essence of the nerve is cold, and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  Use remedies that are gentle, such as washed rose petals steeped in fresh water, repeatedly soaked in oil, or rose and tutty ointment.
If you wash it also with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner, and use moist ointments.  If the wound is large, use sutures or bring the edges together with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a recess and pus has collected in the bottom, drain it from the lowest point. If an artery has been severed and you see blood flowing from the wound, tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary.
If part or all of the cartilage of the larynx has been cut, but the vessels are intact, stitch the edges of the skin to the larynx cartilage.  Do not touch the larynx itself, but smooth it and restore it to its natural shape, then tie it firmly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, probe it.  If there are bone fragments, remove all that is possible.  If not all can be removed, leave it until the wound becomes necrotic and heals, making removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powder we described.  If the bone in the wound becomes necrotic and forms a fistula, treat it as described in the section on chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see a recess, look to see if air comes out of it when the patient breathes. If so, know that it is a fatal wound.  If it has no recess and is fresh with blood, do not immediately apply powder or tighten it, lest the blood be trapped in its recess.
Otherwise, it will recede to the heart and kill the patient.  Instead, apply a drawing ointment twice daily.  If no ointment is available, place a used cotton swab in the wound opening to absorb the moisture. Have the patient sleep with the wound uppermost.
To drain any accumulated matter.  If three days or more have passed, and the patient shows no spasms, poor palpitations, or shortness of breath, and their overall condition is good, then know the wound is safe. Treat it with bandages and other remedies until it heals.
If it is impossible to see and the discharge is always present, know that it has become a fistula. Treat it according to the relevant section. The patient should lie on the wound, to drain any accumulated matter. If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with the previously described suturing method.
If it is large, or if small, if it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, probe the wound and remove those fragments if they are loose. If they are not loose, leave them until later.
The wound will fester, and this will make it easier to remove them.  The treatment of other injuries occurring in other parts of the body is governed by the same principles as those previously discussed.
Chapter Eighty-five.
On wounds of the abdomen, intestinal prolapse, and their suture.
A wound in the abdomen may be large, small, or medium. A large wound may expose one or several intestines, making their replacement and suture more difficult and challenging.
A small wound, too, can present difficulties in another way, making its repair more challenging.  If the intestines are not immediately returned to their place, they swell and thicken, making their replacement difficult.  Therefore, the best type of wound is the medium one, because it does not present the same difficulty in returning the intestines as the other two types.
Know that the sutures for abdominal repair are of four types. Two are general types, suitable for abdominal sutures and for the sutures of other bodily wounds; the other two are specific, applicable to all wounds but particularly suited to abdominal sutures.
I will describe them to you one by one with explanation. If the wound is small and something of the intestine protrudes, its return is difficult for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine has previously swollen due to exposure to cold air.
If this is the case, it is necessary to warm it by soaking a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water, alone or with cooked cumin, safflower, and poppy seeds, and applying it to the intestines until the swelling subsides.
A drink with astringent properties may also achieve this, and is better than water alone in dissolving the swelling.  If you see that the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestines with water in which crocus or fennel seeds have been cooked, for this will make its return easier.
If, after this treatment, its return is still impossible, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used for lancing boils.  The initial treatment, if successful, is preferable to incision, and incision is only resorted to as a last resort when all other means fail.  This is a picture of the instrument.
Its one curved side is limited, and the other side is not limited. The thin end is not as thin as the scalpel, but a little blunt. It is a small, somewhat awl-like tool, as you see.  If the wound is wide and the intestines have entered, it is necessary that their return be to their natural shape.
Its specific location, if possible, is preferable. However, if the wound is large and located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, the head and chest should be higher than the lower body.
Likewise, if the wound is in one side of the abdomen, always aim to keep the side with the incision higher than the other.  This is how it should be applied in major and minor surgeries.
For smaller incisions, position it as best you can. Then, have a helpful assistant hold the entire wound with their hands, bringing the edges together, and then slowly expose the area to the person in charge of stitching.
This is the general method of stitching: take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound, then leave a space the thickness of a little finger from the edges of the wound, and insert one needle without thread into the edges of the skin. With the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin, from the inside, so that it penetrates from that side.  The edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum are now brought together in four layers.  Then, a double-threaded suture is tied around the needle multiple times from both sides until the edges of the wound are firmly united.
Then leave a space equal to the width of a finger and insert another needle.  Then thread it with the suture, as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with the necessary needles until the entire wound is closed.  Let the needles be of medium thickness.
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick needles are also difficult to insert into the skin, therefore, they should be of medium thickness.  Also, the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close to the surface.
So that the flesh does not tear quickly and the wound does not reopen before healing, and do not leave the stitches too far apart so that the wound does not prevent healing.  Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient during sleep.  Provide him with linen bandages to cover both ends of the needles.
Leave them until you know that the wound has healed.  This type of stitching with needles is best suited for minor surgeries, as only one or two needles, or so, may be required for the stitching.
As for the method of stitching for a common wound, gather the four edges – meaning the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum – together in one step with a needle containing a suture thread of moderate thinness and thickness.  Then, after the needle has passed through these four edges, return the needle from the same side from which it began.
So that the thread is interwoven over the top of the wound, just like stitching bags used to secure goods.  Leave a space of the width of a little finger between each stitch.  This method of stitching is known by everyone.
With this method of stitching, a surgical procedure was performed on a man who had a knife wound in his abdomen.  The surgical incision was more than a span long, and about two spans of the small intestine had been exposed. The wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
After the intestines had been exposed outside the wound for twenty-four hours, he returned them to their place. The wound healed in about fifteen days.  He was treated until he was completely recovered and lived many years afterward, functioning normally in all aspects of his life.  Doctors had initially concluded that he would not recover.
Surprisingly, I did not use any ointments because I was in a place without any medicines.  I placed used cotton on the wound twice a day and treated it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the specialized types of stitching, I will describe it based on Galen's writings: Begin stitching from the skin, inserting the needle from the outside to the inside.  Once the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle extending straight through the length of the abdomen...
Leave the peritoneum edge on the side where you inserted the needle.  Then, insert the needle into the other edge of the peritoneum, from inside to outside, at the other edge of the mesentery.  If you have done this, then insert it again into this same edge of the mesentery, from outside to inside.
Leave the peritoneum edge on this side, and insert the needle into its other edge, from inside to outside.  And as you insert it into the peritoneum, also insert it into the edge of the mesentery on that side, so that it passes through all of them.
Then, begin again from this same side, following the edge of the peritoneum on the other side. Bring the needle out of the skin near it, then return it to that skin, and follow the edge of the peritoneum on the other side along this edge of the mesentery.
Bring it out of the skin on its side, and do this again and again, until you stitch the entire wound in this way.  In short, the characteristic of this suture is that it stitches like a furrier stitches fur.
That you stitch the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leave it once from the other side, until it is empty.  As for the second type of specialized suture, which Galen also mentioned, this is his wording exactly.
It is to suture it in the manner some practitioners suture, by bringing each part to its matching counterpart by nature; they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the mesentery to its other edge, and this is as I describe to you.
The needle should be inserted into the edge of the mesentery near you, from the outside, and penetrate it alone from the inside.  Leave the two edges of the peritoneum.  Then withdraw the needle and penetrate from the outside to the inside of both edges of the peritoneum, and then withdraw it again.
And penetrate it from the inside to the outside in the other edge of the mesentery on the opposite side.  This type of suture is better than the general, easy suture previously mentioned.  This is Galen's exact words.  Some have said that the abdomen may be sutured with two needles. That is, you put one thread through them, and begin by inserting the needle from your side, penetrating to the other side; and insert the other needle from the opposite side, penetrating to your side, according to the method of suturing sacks.
Know that if the perforation is in the middle of the abdomen, its repair is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.  As for treating the wound, its treatment is like other surgical wounds.  If you find the wound fresh, with its blood, before the air changes it, and you have returned the intestines to their place and sutured and strengthened it, then apply a medicated plaster to it.
If the wound has been altered by the air, apply some of the ointments available to you until it suppurates, the sutures fall out, and the peritoneum and mesentery heal.  Then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals.
If you lack medicines, apply powdered cotton wool from the outset of suppuration.  Change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.  You generally won't need further treatment if the injuries are minor, unless you fear that the wound will cause significant pain in major organs.
Therefore, you should dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpits.  If he feels pain or foul-smelling discharge in his intestines, which often occurs, irrigate him with a lukewarm, dark astringent drink.
Especially if the foul-smelling discharge has reached the intestines and has become a penetrating wound into its interior.  Know that the thicker parts of the intestines heal more easily, and the thinner parts more difficultly.
As for the jejunum, it does not heal from injuries inflicted upon it at all, because of its numerous and substantial blood vessels, its thin tissue, and its proximity to nerves.  However, if the protruding part of the wound is recognizable and fresh, return it to its proper place, just as you would any other part of the intestines.
If it has been some time and the protruding part has turned green or black, you should tie a thread above the darkened area to prevent bleeding, as the protruding part contains blood vessels and arteries. Then cut what is below the ligature.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the incision, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull it out and remove the protruding part when the wound discharges pus.  This describes a wound that occurs in the intestine. Now, if a small perforation occurs in the intestine...
Sometimes, in some people, it can be repaired. I saw a man who had been stabbed in the abdomen with a spear, the wound to the right of the stomach. The wound festered, and feces and wind escaped from it.  I treated him, though I didn't expect a cure. I continued to treat him until he recovered and the area healed.  When I saw the area had healed, I feared that a mishap might occur in his body. But he suffered no mishap, and remained in the best of health. He ate, drank, had sex, and went to the bath, and was active in his service.  Experienced practitioners have noted that when a small wound occurs in the intestine, it should be treated in this manner.
Take large ants with prominent heads, then bring the edges of the wound together. Place one ant, its mouth open, onto the wound's edges. When it bites down and closes its mouth, sever its head; it will adhere and not dissolve. Then place another ant near the first.
Continue this process with several ants, depending on the size of the wound. Then, close and stitch the wound. Those heads remain stuck to the intestine until it heals and recovers; no harm occurs to the patient. The intestine can also be stitched with fine thread.
To remove the animal glue from the thread, first insert the thread into a needle; then, pull a length from the glue,  and tie a thin, spun linen thread to it. Then, insert that combined thread into the needle. The thread of the glue is used to stitch the intestine and then returned to the abdomen. This method of stitching with ants and glue is merely a matter of hope and expectation.
However, if the tear is large and extensive, especially if in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy and no cure at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the treatment of the cold and the nasal discharge.
Know that any wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic, old, and ulcerated, and does not heal, and continuously discharges pus without cessation, is generally called, in any part of the body, a fistula, and we call it a cold, a fistula.
It is, in fact, a hardened, dense, white mass without pain, with a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some call it a feather.  Sometimes it is moist, constantly discharging pus, and at times the moisture may cease. This moisture may be copious, scant, thick, or thin.
I previously stated in the classification of surgical cases that every ulcer that does not heal, and in which flesh does not grow, is due to one of nine causes. One of them is either due to a lack of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it or on its edges which prevents the growth of good flesh. Or it may be due to excessive harm and filth, or that the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter discharging from it is of poor quality.  Or it may be due to inappropriate treatment.  Or to a general pestilence afflicting the region. Or to a specific local condition.
Or it may be due to excessive harm and filth, or that the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter discharging from it is of poor quality.  Or it may be due to inappropriate treatment.  Or to a general pestilence afflicting the region. Or to a specific local condition. As was observed in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases is difficult, and the healing of tumors is slow, naturally, or because of the presence of one or multiple bones.  I have detailed all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the classification.
Here, I need to inform you of the treatment of fistula and the cold that occurs through manual work. Know that fistulas may occur in all parts of the body, some leading to large vessels, arteries, or nerves.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of many components, such as the hand and foot.  Some lead to the proximity of a principal organ, and so on.
Those fistulas of this nature are among the difficult-to-cure illnesses, which do not accept treatment, and working on them is tedious and fraught with ignorance.  If the fistulas do not reach the locations mentioned, and I have hope and expectation for their treatment.
If you wish to understand this, take a probe of copper or iron. If the fistula runs straight, explore it with it. If the fistula has a curve, explore it with a thin lead probe, for lead is soft.
If it (the probe) glides upon entering and turns toward the curve, if the fistula has many openings which you cannot ascertain with the probe, inject one opening. The moisture you inject will travel to the other openings and flow out.
Then, thoroughly investigate in any way possible to determine if there is a bone or nerve, or if the fistula's bottom is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with many openings.  Understand all of this as much as your keen, skillful investigation and the pain when you touch the area allow.
And similar to that are the signs and causes of the swelling. If you have ascertained all of this accurately, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  If...
If the fistula is superficial, close, or in a healthy area far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the places I have mentioned, then incise the fistula as previously described, and remove any hardened tissue, corrupted flesh, and excess tissue.
And treat any flesh or warts that grow in its opening, until it heals. If the fistula is deep and straight, you should incise it as deeply as possible and then clean it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then, use medicated lint infused with strong medications and insert it into the fistula's bottom, which you can feel with the iron.  Do this repeatedly until the strong medicine consumes all remaining corruption in the fistula's bottom.
Then, treat it with ointments that promote healthy tissue growth until it heals. If it does not heal this way, cauterize it as previously described. If the fistula's cause is bone, and you are sure of this, then probe and incise it as I instructed you, unless something prevents you.
If it is a vein, nerve, or major organ, as we said, and the bone is exposed and shows some corruption and blackness, then remove the corruption until it is gone, and then treat it with something that promotes healing until it heals; if it does not heal and the pus persists as before.
Know that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption.  Expose all of it again, thoroughly removing and cleaning it with all your effort, then treat it. If it heals, well and good. If not, know that the corruption lies deep within. Expose all of it again.
Thoroughly remove and cleanse it with all your effort.  If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, remove it with the delicate forceps suitable for that purpose.
If there are many bones, remove them all completely; do not leave any behind.  If any ligaments obstruct them, and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and the flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones immediately, apply something that will rot the wound. Leave it for several days until the flesh and ligaments around the bones rot. Protect the wound so that the incision you made during the procedure does not heal.
If you fear this, apply a cotton ball soaked in powdered sulfur and oil, or a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian ointment or another green ointment. When the ligaments have rotted and the bones have loosened, removing and pulling them out will be easier.
If the bone is large, like a leg bone or thigh bone, and only its surface is corrupted, thoroughly cleanse it until the blackness and corruption are gone, and then close the wound. If a significant portion is corrupted, and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, it must be spread open.
Cut it all the way to where the corruption ends. Then treat it until it heals. I am telling you about a case of a man with a sore in his leg, to make it an example and a guide for your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years ago, he experienced pain in his leg due to a disturbance within the body, causing matter to reach the leg and a large swelling.  The cause was not external.  Then, time passed with the misjudgment of the physicians, until the swelling opened.
A great deal of matter flowed from it, and his treatment was poor, until the leg became diseased and contained many openings, all discharging pus and bodily fluids.  A group of physicians treated him for about two years, and none of them were skilled surgeons.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg, and a great deal of matter flowed from those openings. The man's body had wasted away, and his complexion had turned yellow. I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
I found that some of them connected to others from all parts of the leg. I then opened one of those openings, revealing some of the bone. I found it decayed, eroded, blackened, putrid, and riddled with holes, even penetrating to the marrow.  I reported what I found.
I removed the diseased bone, and I believe that there is nothing but this decay in the bone that I excised and reported. I then applied healing remedies to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal. Then I again exposed the bone, beyond the first exposure.
I found the decay connected to the bone, and I reported what decay I saw as well. Then I tried to heal it, but it did not heal or close. Then I exposed it again, and I continued cutting the bone piece by piece, attempting to heal it, but it would not heal, until I cut away about a span of bone.
I removed it with its marrow, then healed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and was cured. This repetition of work and opening was necessary due to the patient's weakness and poor tolerance, and my fear for his life, because he was often suffering from fainting spells due to excessive vomiting. He was completely cured.
Strong flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his condition in his body improved. His strength returned, and he managed his affairs.  He experienced no impediment in walking that harmed him at all.  If a bone in any part of the body broke,
It is necessary to treat it in this way: take a bandage and tie it to the protruding end of the bone, and have someone pull it upwards.  Then make another bandage of thicker wool than the first.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone, and pull the end so the flesh is drawn downwards.  While you expose the flesh at the location you want to treat, so that the saw does not harm the flesh, place a plank or board under the bone from below, firmly in place.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the decayed bone.  The incision should be slightly above the decayed area, so that there is no decay in the bone cavity, which would not be apparent to the senses.  Then you will be forced to make the incision again.
If the bone is decayed but not protruding, rather its parts are joined together, and the decay is in its middle or some portion of it, then expose the flesh on all sides.  Place the board underneath, then make the incision from the first side, where the decay is.
When you have finished the incision, make another incision on the other side.  Let the incision be a short distance from the decay, as we said. If the decay is in a joint, cut the decayed joint itself and make the incision on the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the decay is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy other than removal.  If the decay is in the hand or foot, treatment is extremely difficult.  However, you should remove the decay, however it appears, and scrape and clean it in any way you can.
By any method that is possible, provided that no vein or nerve is encountered.  Understand that the saws and instruments for cutting these bones vary according to the position, structure, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, strength, and fragility of the bones. Therefore, a tool appropriate to each type of work must be prepared.
Understand that the work itself will show you the type of tool you need if you have long experience and knowledge of the craft, for the master craftsman, having seen many cases, knows the nature of diseases. He may invent tools similar to those needed for each disease, and I have illustrated for you a set of tools at the end of this chapter.
These serve as examples to be followed and as a measure for other similar cases, God willing.  Image of a saw:.

Chapter eighty-seven.
In the amputation of limbs and the exposure of bones.
The limbs may decay either from an external or internal cause. If you treat this decay with medicinal remedies and the treatment is ineffective, and you see the decay spreading through the limb unchecked.
Then it is necessary to amputate the limb where the decay has reached, so that the patient may be saved from death or a great affliction greater than the loss of the limb.  A sign of this affliction is that the limb darkens until it appears as if burned by fire.
Or it may decay after turning black, so that the decay spreads to the adjacent limb and the entire body.  Proceed to amputate it.  Similarly, if the cause of the decay is a sting of venomous creatures like the sea scorpion, viper, or centipede, and the like.
If the decay or sting is in a fingertip, amputate the finger and do not delay the spread of the decay to the hand.  Likewise, if it has reached the hand, amputate it at the wrist, and do not delay the spread of the decay to the forearm.
Similarly, if it has reached the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow, at the joint itself. If the decay has spread and you see it affecting the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder at all, for that will lead to the patient's death. Use other treatments according to your ability.
Likewise, do the same for the leg. If the decay reaches the toe, amputate the toe at one of the joints. If it reaches the foot, amputate the entire leg. If it ascends to the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to leave it and allow the patient to succumb to death.  The procedure for amputating or dissecting the limb is to tie a bandage below the area you intend to cut and tie another bandage above the area.
One attendant pulls the lower bandage downward, another pulls the upper bandage upward.  You use a wide scalpel to expose the entire flesh between the bandages.  Then cut or dissect it.  You should place linen cloths on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct area, causing the patient excessive pain and a hot swelling.  If bleeding occurs during your work, immediately cauterize the area or apply some sharp hemostatic agents, then return to your treatment until it is finished.
Then bandage the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I tell you an example of a man who had this exact affliction in his leg.  There appeared a blackening with a burning sensation like fire in his leg.
This decay first appeared in his finger, and eventually affected his entire hand.  The man, when he saw the decay spreading in the limb and experiencing intense pain and burning, had it amputated at the joint, and he recovered.
After a long time, this decay appeared again in his index finger.  He came to me, and I applied remedies to his hand, having first cleansed his body. But the decay did not cease and spread to the other finger.
Until the decay spread throughout his hand. He asked me to amputate his hand, but I refused, hoping to restrain the decay, and fearing that amputation might cause his death because his strength was failing.  When he despaired of me, he returned to his homeland.
I was later told that he eventually cut off his entire hand and recovered. I have related this story to be of assistance in understanding this type of illness, and as a guide for treatment.
Eighty-eighth Chapter.
On the treatment of abscesses and how to inject medications into them.
If a tumor forms in any of the fleshy organs and persists for a prolonged period, and then bursts or subsides and all the matter within it is discharged, leaving the area empty like a vessel.
The skin over it, like a torn garment, is thin and has not yet progressed to the point of affecting bone, nerve, or ligament. For this reason it is called an abscess, and not a fistula, unless the condition persists long enough that the decay affects one of these structures.
In that case, it is called a fistula or a cold sore.  Its treatment is to cut all the skin surrounding it, especially if it has become thin and like a rag, and you are certain that it does not adhere to the area due to the decay.
If you anticipate that the skin will adhere, and the decay has not reached that extent, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it by injection.  Observe the abscess; if it is large and the pus emanating from it has a foul odor, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris, in equal parts, combined in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens and achieves the consistency of honey. Then, take what you need, thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess.  Close the opening and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then, remove it by squeezing.  Do this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.  You may also inject with ash water if you do not have this medicine. This is done by taking the ash of olive wood or ash of oak wood and pouring water over it.
Then, strain it and inject it until you are certain that the abscess has been washed out. If the patient cannot tolerate either the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, inject with water and honey mixed with some pulverized verdigris.
Or inject with honey and a drink mixed together, because honey is capable of cleansing and washing, and the drink adheres to the abscess, especially if the drink has a quality of constriction and dryness.  If you do this repeatedly and are certain that the abscess's corruption is gone, then inject with something to promote flesh growth there.
For example, take some of the palm ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and a constricting drink, or inject it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose properties we have described in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the abscess is narrow and does not accommodate the syringe,
If it is narrow, widen it slightly with a tool, or place a wick soaked in Egyptian or Sirriqun ointment inside it until it widens. Also, if the opening is wide, bring together its edges with stitches, leaving an opening just large enough for the syringe to enter without excess.
Also, if the opening from which pus is flowing is located high up, cut it in the lowest place so the pus flows downwards, because if pus is congested in the depths of the abscess, it prevents the flesh from growing there.
If you cannot cut the abscess towards the bottom as you wish, then apply pressure to the limb so that the pus flows out easily as best you can, and ensure that no pus remains trapped inside.
As for the uniting medicines to be applied to the abscess from the outside, and how to apply them, take one of the uniting ointments appropriate to your needs, and spread it on a linen cloth. The cloth should be large enough to cover the entire abscess. Then, using scissors, cut a hole slightly larger than the opening of the abscess.  Spread a soft ointment onto another cloth, sized to fit the hole, and place it over the hole, keeping it away from the abscess opening to allow easy drainage of pus. Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
For several days, the one over the opening of the abscess is the one that is removed at all times so that the collected pus may drain out, and you may know whether the pus that flows from it is copious or scant, or mature or immature.
And also, examine the location of the abscess itself. Does the patient feel pain there, or not? Is there swelling, or not?  If your treatment continues in this manner, and you see the discharge from the abscess opening becoming slight,
Know that the abscess has adhered or is close to adhering.  Then, treat it again tomorrow or on the third day.  When you treat the wound, replace the cloths with new ones and renew the ointment. If after a long time, thin pus comes out of the abscess, do not despair of its adhesion.
For healing is near, because some people have slow tissue growth in their wounds, and others have the opposite. If, after many days, unripe pus comes out of the abscess, know that the abscess has not adhered. If the abscess's adhesion is delayed,
Then increase the drying of the medications. Let the medications be moist in consistency and dry in strength, such as the palm ointment, if more opoponax has been added to it.  The most effective treatment is to take the palm ointment.
It can be treated with rose oil and sprinkled with moderate-strength, aged liquid, then mixed with it and used.  One can do the same thing if palm ointment isn't available; honey, if cooked until it thickens, can be used, or take myrrh, aloes, and kandar and grind them all together and sprinkle them on the honey while it is on the fire. Then, apply it to a cloth and bandage it over the abscess, or apply the thickened cooked honey, sprinkle the remedies on it, and place cloths over it and bandage it.
Long zeraun, the rhizome of the asphodel, kresna flour, and rue, either used alone or combined, can also be ground, sifted, and sprinkled on the honey I described, and used. If the abscess persists and doesn't heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
If it has affected the bones, or other tough nerves or ligaments, treat it as a boil, as described previously.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
In treating the abscess, the injured finger, the excess finger, and the divided joining of fingers.
A daḥs is a thick fleshy growth that grows beneath the nail of the thumb or toe, and sometimes on other fingers. If it persists and is neglected, it swells into a hot, inflamed tumor.
Or it may fester and become so severe as to consume the root of the nail, and possibly destroy the entire nail.  Perhaps the decay reaches the bone, causing a foul odor, broadening the fingertip, and discoloration.  If you treat it with the methods we mentioned in the classification and your treatment is unsuccessful.
Then you should cut away all excess flesh growing from the nail with a knife, and then cauterize the wound.  Cauterization in this case is very effective.  If the bone is healthy and the nail also,
If the corner of the nail had pressed the flesh inwards, causing it to be pricked and irritated, then a thin strip of material should be placed under the corner of the nail that is pricking the flesh, lifting it upwards, and the flesh should be gently cut away.
Apply caustic and burning medications to the remaining flesh until it is all gone, then treat with ointments until it heals. If the decay has affected the bone, then that bone must be cut out and removed, for it will never heal as long as there is decayed bone.
If you see decay and erosion spreading in the finger, amputate it at one of the phalanges, as previously mentioned, and then treat it until it heals. If the nail is struck or injured and severe pain ensues, then you should first bleed the affected area.
Then split the nail with a sharp scalpel, making a slanted split from top to bottom. Be careful not to reach the flesh underneath the nail with the split, as this will cause intense pain to the affected area and lead to excess flesh growth at that spot. Then treat the area with something that relieves the pain.
Concerning the extra finger that develops in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may have bone in some parts, or it may even have a nail. Some of it may grow from the base of a joint of another finger.
Or it may grow on some of the finger's phalanges. Those that grow on some of the finger's phalanges do not move, and those that grow at the finger joint may move. Whatever part of it is purely flesh can be easily removed by cutting it at its base with a broad scalpel.
However, those that grow from the base of the joint are difficult to treat, so avoid cutting them.  As for those that grow on the finger at one of the phalanges, it is necessary to first cut the flesh in a circular manner down to the bone, then to use one of those appropriate saws to split the bone.
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the adhesion that sometimes occurs between fingers, this frequently happens, either present from birth, or resulting from a healed wound, burn, or similar injury.  In such cases, it is necessary to separate the adhesion.
So that the fingers return to their natural position.  Then place between them a cloth or a wick soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly adhere again, and separate them or place a thin sheet of lead between them, so that the area heals as it should.
Likewise, if adhesion occurs between some of the fingers and the palm, separate the adhesion according to what is suitable and appropriate for the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On cutting the veins.
Veins are twisted, thick blood vessels filled with dark, blackish phlegm, occurring in most parts of the body, and most frequently in the legs, especially in those who travel and in porters and carriers.  First, one should use vigorous rubbing of the body to remove the dark matter repeatedly.
Then, bleed the affected person using a lancet.  Treatment with iron is of two types: one is to cut and release the dark blood; the other is to cut the vein and remove it completely.  For cutting it, the leg is first warmed with hot water.
Until the thick, murky blood is loosened; then, the patient's leg is bound with a bandage from above the thigh to below the knee; then, the vein is cut in one, two, or three wide incisions.
Then, remove the black blood with your hand from the bottom of the leg upwards and from top to bottom, until you have removed as much blood as you deem sufficient or as much as the patient's strength allows; then, bandage it, and instruct the patient to avoid foods that produce black phlegm, and repeat vomiting and bleeding.
When the veins become full and harm the patient, as for its removal, it will be done in this way: shave the patient's leg if it has a lot of hair; then, place the patient in a bath and warm the leg with hot water until it turns red and sweats, or have them do vigorous exercise.
If a bath is not available to warm the limb, then cut the skin alongside the vein lengthwise, either near the knee or lower at the heel, then open the skin with hooks and peel the vein from all sides until it is visible to the touch.
When it appears, you will see it red and smooth. Once it is freed from the skin, it will also appear like a tendon. Then, insert a probe under it until it rises and protrudes from the skin; then, use a smooth, blunt hook to lift and remove it. Then, make another incision near that incision, about the size of three fingers.
Then peel the skin off the vein until it is exposed. Then lift it with the probe as you did before and hang it with another hook as you did at first, then make another incision, or multiple incisions, if needed.
Then remove it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Then pull it out and remove it until it emerges from the second incision, then pull it towards the incision above it, and do this until you pull it out from the third incision, above all the incisions.  Once it is all out, cut it.
If pulling and removing it does not work, then insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull it. Insert the probe under it and twist your hand in every direction until it comes out, and be careful that it doesn't break. If it breaks, it will be very difficult to remove it.
Leaving it untreated will harm the patient.  Once you have removed it entirely, apply wool soaked in a potion and rose-water or oil to the surgical site and treat it until it heals. If the varicose vein is twisted, winding, and has bends in various directions.
If it was not straight, as we said, then you should make an incision along every bend and twist.  Then hang it from hooks until you remove it completely.  Be careful when making your incisions to not cut or injure the vein, because this will make it more difficult to remove, thus conserving your effort.
Image of the incision used for the varicose vein.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not have a bend like other hooks, nor a sharp tip, so as not to injure the vein.  It should be thick and smooth in its bend, for if it is thin, it will cut the vein with its thinness.  Rather, it should have a desirable thickness, as we said.
Chapter Ninety-one.
In the case of the superficial vein.
This vein arises in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the Arab lands, and in hot, sparsely populated, barren countries. It may also arise in other parts of the body besides the legs, arising from an infection that occurs beneath the skin.
As it occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms, and the swelling of the gourd, and the worm that grows between the skin and flesh. A sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a severe burning sensation occurs in the leg, then the area swells, and then the vein begins to emerge from the location of the swelling.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal.  Once its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing one to two dirhams, tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it outwards, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it grows excessively, cut off some of it and wrap the rest.  Do not cut it from its root before it is all out, because if you cut it, it will shrink and enter the flesh, causing a swelling, an infection, and a foul ulcer in the area.
Therefore, it should be slowly drawn out little by little until the last bit is out and nothing of it remains in the body.  In some individuals, this vein can extend to five or ten cubits in length.
It has come to my attention that a vein of twenty cubits emerged from a man. If it breaks during your treatment, insert a drain into the hole and extend it a long way into the body so that all the material within is expelled.  Try to heal the area with remedies for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or the leg itself, producing many openings and branches emerging from each opening. Treat it as described in the classification and as previously mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-two.
Concerning the abscesses that develop under the hoof and are called "the cow's disease".
This disease is called "the cow's disease" in some of our countries because it often affects cows. It is a small, single worm that develops between the skin and flesh, moving throughout the body, both up and down.
The worm's movement from one organ to another can be sensed, until it pierces the skin at a point.  Its formation is from the putrefaction of some humors, as occurs with worms, snakes, and the "gourd" swelling in the abdomen.
The danger it poses is that if it moves throughout the body and ascends to the head, reaching the eye, it may break through the eye and escape, causing blindness, which often happens.  Therefore, its removal is possible only when its movement and presence are perceptible.
Therefore, one should tie tightly above and below it with a strong bandage, then cut open and remove it. If it has burrowed deep into the flesh and cannot be found, apply cauterization with fire to the area until it is burned away.  Its greatest potential harm is to the eye, as we have said.
If it is seen in the head, near the eye, tie tightly below it on the forehead, then cut open and remove it.  The patient must take care to cleanse their body with medicines that ease the expulsion of putrid, poor humors and avoid foods that generate putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-three.
Concerning the incision for the disease known as the "nafar".
This disease, called "nafar" in our country, is a pain that appears in certain parts of the body and then moves from one part to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a woman in the countryside who revealed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of her arm. After an hour, I saw the swelling moving up the forearm, like a worm moving quickly towards her shoulder, as quickly as mercury can move.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain disappears from that place and settles in the shoulder. After an hour, it ran throughout the rest of the body, even to the other arm.  She told me that it circulated through her entire body, as I observed.
I was amazed by the speed of its movement from one part of the body to another.  I had not previously seen this disease in this form with my own eyes, although I had heard of others who experience pain moving from one part to another.  However, I had not seen it firsthand as I saw it in this woman.
I attributed this only to the fact that the woman was from the desert, with a dry body and exposed veins.  Therefore, this moving sensation was apparent to the touch.  It is likely not to appear in the same way in those of comfort, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it, and the patient feels pain, if it appears visibly as described, then firmly press above and below it, and lance it so that the congested air escapes and is released from the location.
If you do not see it, treat it by shaking the body and dispersing the air, like the ointment for foul smell and the ointment for scabies, and similar medicines.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On extracting arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and the locations where they pierce the body.  Their variation by type includes large and small, hollow and solid glass, and those with three and four angles.
Some have tongues, and some have shards.  As for their location in relation to the body's organs, they are of two types: either they pierce major hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. If an arrow strikes one of these organs, and signs of death, which I will describe to you later, appear, then you should avoid extracting the arrow, for death will usually follow the sufferer. If these unfavorable signs do not appear, and the arrow has not been driven deep into the organ, extract it and treat the wound.  And among the signs of an arrow striking the brain, piercing the bone and wounding the brain's membranes, are severe headache, dizziness, and vertigo.
If these unfavorable signs do not appear, and the arrow has not been driven deep into the organ, extract it and treat the wound.  And among the signs of an arrow striking the brain, piercing the bone and wounding the brain's membranes, are severe headache, dizziness, and vertigo. Redness in the eyes and tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting, and perhaps bleeding from the nostrils or ears; possibly the loss of speech and voice; and a white, porridge-like moisture, resembling the watery part of meat, flowing from the wound site.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow, if it has not already been removed.  As for the signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left breast and feels as if it has lodged in something solid rather than empty, ...
...and perhaps there is a pulsating motion like that of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound.  This may be followed by coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting; know that death is inevitable.  A sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels following the neck swell, the patient's complexion changes, and they breathe heavily, craving the inhalation of cool air.  If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be close to the small ribs, and breathing will be labored with severe pain.
And the patient sighs and all the muscles of the shoulders move.  If the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain will follow, and blood resembling the liver in its redness will flow from the wound.  If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food may issue from the wound.
The situation is obvious. If the arrow strikes the abdomen, causing a perforation, and something from the intestines or bowels is expelled from the wound, there is no hope for treatment or removing the arrow.  If the arrow strikes the bladder, urine will be expelled.
If something protrudes from the wound and the patient's pain intensifies, know that he is doomed.  As for the other organs, like the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, the majority of the time they will escape harm.
Unless the arrow strikes an artery or nerve, and unless the arrow is poisoned, I will tell you about some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may deduce treatment from it.  An arrow struck a man's eye socket at the root of his nose.
I removed it from the other side, under the earlobe, and he recovered without any harm to his eye.  I removed another arrow for a Jew, which had lodged in his earlobe beneath the lower eyelid.  The arrow had receded, and I only retrieved its small tip, which adhered to the shaft.
It was a large arrow, from a composite bow, with square, smooth iron, having no barbs.  The Jew recovered without any harm to his eye.  I also removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arab-made.
It had two barbs. I split it open between the windpipes.  It had lodged in his throat, and I gently worked on it until I removed it. The Christian survived and recovered. I also removed another arrow that had lodged in a man's stomach, and we thought he would die from it.
After about thirty days or so, and with no change in his condition, I split the arrow and worked on it until I removed it. He recovered and no harm befell him. I saw a man with an arrow lodged in his back, and the wound had become inflamed.
Then, seven years later, the arrow came out from the base of his thigh.  I saw a woman with an arrow lodged in her abdomen, where the wound had become inflamed.  The arrow remained, but there was no change in her condition, and she experienced no impediment in her normal activities.
I saw another man with an arrow lodged in his face, where the wound had become inflamed.  He felt little pain.  There are many like this.  I removed an arrow from the nose of one of the Sultan's officers. It had lodged in the middle of his nose, slightly to the right side.
The arrowhead disappeared completely. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow was lodged. I found the arrow wound very narrow.  I probed it with a fine instrument, but felt nothing.  He was experiencing a prickling sensation and pain under his ear, on the right side.
I hoped that the prickling was from the arrowhead, and so I dressed the area with a dressing that promoted attraction and maturation, hoping the area would swell and the arrow's position would become evident, so I could cut into it. But nothing happened to suggest that the arrow had reached that location.
I continued to apply the dressing for many days, but nothing happened.  The wound eventually healed.  The patient remained hopeless about extracting the arrow for a long time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. He informed me, and I applied a strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it. I felt the thin arrowhead, which was stuck to the bone.  Then I continued to enlarge the wound with that strong medicine until the arrowhead became visible.  I spent about four months with him.
Then, when the wound was widened and I was able to insert the forceps, I pulled and moved it, but it did not come out.  I continued to gently manipulate it with various instruments until I grasped it one day with strong forceps, as their form will be shown in the last section of this book.
The physicians had declared that his nasal cartilage could not be repaired, but I repaired it. The wound healed, and the patient recovered completely without any further discomfort. I am telling you how I extracted some arrows so that you may use this as a guide and example for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft, and their details, cannot be grasped by description or encompassed by a book. Instead, the skillful craftsman makes comparisons between the little and the much, between what is present and what is absent, and invents a new action and a new instrument when faced with unusual cases.
Concerning this craft, I say that arrows are extracted from the organs where they are lodged in two ways: either by pulling them from the point of entry, or from the opposite side, which is the point of exit.
If the arrow is protruding through flesh, it can be pulled out.  If it resists removal, you should leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh becomes infected, making its removal easier. The same applies if it is lodged in bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for several days and try pulling and moving it each day.  It will eventually come out.  If it still does not come out after several days, you should pierce around the arrow in the same bone from every side with a delicate instrument until the arrow loosens, then pull it out.
If the arrow is lodged in the skull bone and has penetrated one of the brain cavities, and some of the symptoms I mentioned have appeared, do not pull out the arrow.  Leave it until its condition improves after several days.
Proceed with pulling out the arrow.  If it is deeply embedded and resists removal, use the instruments around the arrow as described previously. Then treat the wound until it heals.  If the arrow is hidden in a part of the body, and it is hidden from sight, probe for it with a probe. If you locate it, pull it out using appropriate tools. If you cannot, because the wound is narrow and the arrow is deeply embedded, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way,
make an incision to widen the wound and gain access to the arrow so that you can remove it.  If the arrow has two barbs, grasp them and carefully separate the surrounding flesh from each side using any method possible. If you cannot remove the flesh, break or twist the barbs until you are able to remove it.
When attempting to remove the arrow from any location, use forceps to twist it in all directions until you remove it. Be extremely gentle so the arrow does not break and make removal more difficult. If you cannot remove it after your attempt,
leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh decays. Then try again.  If bleeding occurs, apply the treatments mentioned in the section on bleeding, and be careful not to sever a vein, nerve, or tendon. Use your best judgment.
Use every method possible to remove the arrow, gently, carefully, and firmly, as described.  When pulling the arrow out, try to restore the wound to the shape it was in when the arrow entered. This is the best approach.
If that is not possible, use whatever methods are available. As for the arrow exiting from the opposite side, either a part of it may have already protruded outwards, or you can feel the arrowhead near the surface of the skin and see it protruding.
Cut along it, making the incision large enough for the forceps to grasp. Then pull it out, as it will be easier to remove. If it is lodged in bone, twist your forceps in a circular motion until the arrow loosens itself in the bone and makes room for removal. Then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days and try again until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still present, push it out. If the shaft has fallen out and you wish to use pushing, insert the hollow instrument into the arrowhead's barb to push it out.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits into the hollow.  This will make removing the arrow easier. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize all the affected flesh if possible, then treat it appropriately.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side, and it is close enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision, cut and be careful not to sever a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if necessary, and treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps used to extract arrows:.
Its tips are like the beak of a bird, crafted like a file so that when it grasps an arrow or anything, it does not let go.  There are large, small, and medium sizes, all according to the size of the arrow, the size of the wound, and the width of the wound.

This is solid at the tip, like a rod, to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it out.
Chapter Ninety-five.
On the opening of veins.
The veins customarily opened in the body are thirty.  Of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the *ḥassīsīn*; the two arteries visible on the temples; and the two veins at the corners of the eyes, known as the *nāẓirīn*.
The vein that stands out in the middle of the forehead; the vein at the tip of the nose; the two vessels in the neck; the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth; the two veins in the lower lip; these veins are known as the *jayyār*; and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins opened in the arm and hand, they are five. One is the *qayfāl*, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head.  The *ʾakḥal*, the middle vein, is a combination of a branch of the *bāsīliq* and a branch of the *qayfāl*.  The common people call it the body vein.
And the *bāsīliq*, which is located on the inner side, and is also called the *ʾibṭī*. The common people call it the belly vein and the arm cord. It is located on the *zanad* (forearm), where it is attached. It is the one that clearly appears above the thumb, and the *ʾasīlim*.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, with two branches. In the leg and foot, there are three veins: one under the bend of the knee on the outer side; the second is the *ṣāfin*, located at the heel on the inner side; and the vein of the *nisāʾ*, located at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg, there are three veins like them. As for the two veins behind the ears, their incision is beneficial for chronic colds, migraine, ringworm, and chronic bad head sores.  The method of incision for them, as I will describe.
It is to shave the patient's head and rub the back of the head at the location of the veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well. Then the patient's neck should be strangled with a turban until the veins appear, behind the ears, in the low areas of the head.  Then probe them with your finger and where you feel a pulse under your finger, mark it with ink.
Then take a scalpel, a surgical knife, known as the *nishal*, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards and sever the vein with the skin in a complete cut, the length of the cut being about two clasped fingers.
Or something similar, and release the amount of blood you desire. Then tie them with bandages and leave them until healed.  The cutting and cauterizing of them was discussed earlier in the book.  As for the arteries in the temples, their incision is beneficial for chronic migraine, severe headaches, persistent eye inflammation, and severe eye discharge.
The method of their incision, as I will describe to you: the patient tightens his neck with a turban until the veins become clearly visible, and their pulse is evident beneath your finger. At that point, mark them with ink. Then lift the skin over the vein upward with your index finger.
Insert the *nishal* scalpel from below, lift the vein upward, and sever it as you did with the other veins. Release the blood as needed.  Then loosen the patient's neck restraint, and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Then apply a pledget and bandage, securing it tightly from above. Leave it until healed.  Their mention, incision, and release were discussed earlier in the book. As for the incision of the forehead vein, its benefit comes after the incision of the temporal vein, for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, sores, and persistent redness.
The method of its incision, as I describe to you: the patient tightens his neck with a turban until the vein appears.  Then, take the instrument called the *fāʾis*.  Here is its image:
Place the pointed prong at the head of the *fāʾis* on the same vein. Strike from above with a comb or similar object, allowing the blood to flow as desired.  Then loosen the patient's neck restraint and apply a bandage until healed.
A wide scalpel may be used, but it should not be as sharp as other scalpels, but rather slightly wide at the tip.  Incision should be made with a twisting motion because the bone is nearby; a thin scalpel may break if used.
As for the veins located at the temples, their incision is beneficial for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, and abscesses, and for facial diseases.  The method for incision is that the patient should tighten their neck with a turban, then you should incise them, standing over their head. The incision should be made with a slightly elongated twisting motion using a small, slightly wide scalpel.
If the area has little flesh, a thin scalpel may break.  Then drain the desired amount of blood, place a bandage over the incisions, and bandage them for one night.  Then unbandage them.  As for incision of the nasal vein, it is beneficial for high fevers.
Severe headaches and facial diseases, such as the red inflammation that appears on the nose, especially if chronic, are treated by having the patient tighten their neck.  Then, hold the patient's nose with your left hand and take a long, thin scalpel.
Insert it into the center of the nostril itself, between the nasal septum, in a straight line.  Because the vein isn't perceptible there, blood will immediately appear.  You should push the scalpel slightly and drain the desired amount of blood.  Then bandage it for a night; it will clot quickly.
As for the jugular veins, their incision is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic diseases that appear on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, scabies, bad ulcers, and cancerous growths. The method of incision is to bind the patient's neck under them with a bandage, and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair.  Then, the vein is incised lengthwise, with a fairly wide incision.  Then drain a moderate amount of blood, or as much as needed.  Then do the same to the other vein.  Finally, remove the bandage.
Hold the veins with a moderate grip to prevent suffocation.  Leave it until the next day; the wound will heal.  As for the veins of the cheeks, incision after incision of the veins of the forehead is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum decay, bad ulcers, cracked lips, and bad sores.
which are in and around the nose.  The method of incision is to have the patient sit before you and bind their neck with a turban.  Then turn their lips inward and look for the two veins, one to the right of the lip and the other to the left, recognizing them by their blackness.
Also, there are thin, black veins around them.  Cut these veins completely off. If it is unclear and you do not know which one, aim for the largest and most visible. Do the same for the veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, incision after incision of the veins of the forehead is beneficial for the constrictions that occur in the throat from sore throat and mouth diseases.  The method of incision is to have the patient sit before you facing the sun, raise their tongue, and look under the tongue for a vein on each side. The veins will be dark in color.
Incise them, but be careful not to cut them deeply, as there are arteries underneath.  Excessive cutting might cause bleeding from these arteries.  The three veins that are customarily opened in the elbow are opened in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, fennel-shaped lancet or an olive-shaped lancet, or by making a slit with a scalpel, which is the incision [and this is its image], Image of the wide, fennel-shaped lancet:.
It should be wide, as you see, to be suitable for opening the hollow, full, prominent, visible, thick veins containing thick, dark blood.  This is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:.
This lancet is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for opening thin veins containing thin, yellowish blood.  This is the image of the incision lancet:.
This incision lancet, which is suitable for slitting, comes in various widths and thicknesses, depending on the width or narrowness of the veins.  It can be used as a model for other tools.  It is well-known among craftsmen.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, along the chest and abdomen.  The phlebotomist must be cautious when opening it, and should be careful not to pierce any artery beneath it; if he makes a mistake and plunges the lancet too far, he may cut that artery.
This causes a blood flow, therefore it should not be opened with a lancet used for punctures but instead slit with the incision lancet. If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, it should be avoided and another vein used, or a branch of it sought out.
Or, open the brachial artery, for it is clear and can be slit with the incision lancet, as we said. If you wish to open the basilic vein itself, you should feel the area before tightening the arm to find the pulse point, then mark it with ink.
Then, the arm is tied off, and the vein is slit with an oblique incision using the incision lancet, as we said.  Care should be taken that the blow is kept away from the artery.  Whenever you see inflation in the marked area upon tightening the bandage, that inflation is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If, upon phlebotomy, you see the blood spurting like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is arterial blood.  In that case, quickly place your finger on it for a long time, then remove it; if the bleeding stops, it often does so; then tighten the arm.
Leave it alone, and warn the patient against neglecting it. Let it be on a pillow and do not move it for days until it heals.  If the bleeding does not stop and you are not able to provide a cure at the time, sever the artery if it is visible, as its ends contract and the bleeding stops.
Or take a pistachio shell, split it, and use one half to tightly bind the vein with a bandage and splints until the next day.  If the bleeding stops, well and good; otherwise, treat it with the previously mentioned application of cauterizing devices to stop the bleeding.  Cutting off the bleeding is not usually difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the effectiveness of the bandage on the arm, be aware of this.  As for the *akhal* vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the top of the head and the bottom of the body, because it is composed of a branch of the *basaliq* and a branch of the *qifal*, as we said.
The phlebotomist should be careful to place the vein on a pillow, for underneath it are nerves.  If the lancet penetrates too deep and strikes a nerve, numbness will result, difficult to resolve, and perhaps it will not heal at all.  These nerves are often perceptible to the touch.
If in some people it is hidden and delicate and not easily visible, then make your incision with a gentle tearing motion and avoid the nerves as best you can.  If the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise.  As for the *qifal* vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and in this vein, especially, if you wish to perform phlebotomy, use the olive-shaped lancet or the broad, rue-shaped lancet, for it is the safest of all veins, as it has neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, when performing phlebotomy, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek out the soft spot.  If the vein is not struck on the first attempt, it does no harm to repeat the phlebotomy several times. However, it may swell in some people if not drained on the first strike.
But that swelling does no harm.  As for the method of phlebotomy, its effects, and what should be done to correct them, first you should know that phlebotomy is used either to preserve health.
Or it may be used in illnesses.  The kind used to preserve health and maintain it, and to prevent illness, should be in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the *qifal*, *akhal*, and *basiliq*.  Phlebotomy should be performed in the early spring, if signs of fullness appear.
Phlebotomy should be performed on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of daylight have passed.  As for phlebotomy used for illness, it has no fixed time, but when need and necessity require it, whether night or day.
At any hour and at any time.  Boys should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should old men who have passed sixty years.  If anyone intends to perform phlebotomy for any reason...
He should cleanse his intestines prior to phlebotomy with a gentle enema if there is much retained phlegm, so that foul matter from the intestines is not drawn into the veins during phlebotomy and harms the main organs.  One who is feverish, intoxicated, or drunk should not be bled until these conditions pass.
Phlebotomy should also be avoided after dysentery, vomiting, fevers, excessive intercourse, exertion, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and any bodily or mental activity that weakens the body.  Then, one should consider thinning the humours if the blood is thick, before doing so.
With foods, drinks, and medicines, if possible.  Then he should take a bath, if nothing prevents him, or engage in some exercise, so that the blood will thin.  He should perform phlebotomy in the middle of the day, as we said, and strive to clear his mind of all bad psychological conditions that day.
Such as worries, anger, fear, and all bodily ailments such as excessive fatigue, exhaustion, intercourse, and the like.  Let him have in his presence the things that people commonly use, such as perfumes, herbs, and amusements, and the like, as each person can manage.
Then the phlebotomist should sit on a cushion higher than the one the patient sits on, then the phlebotomist should extend the arm and rub it with his hand two or three times, then tighten the bandage with the ligature and twist it two or three times.  The tightening should be moderate.
Because if the tightening is not moderate, either excessive tightening will prevent the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it will also prevent the flow of blood.  Then, after tightening, the patient should rub his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch.  Then the phlebotomist should wipe the lancet with a little old oil, especially.  Then he should place his left index finger on the same vein slightly below the place where he wants to make the incision so that the vein does not move and avoids striking it. Because some veins are like tendons, they move during phlebotomy, and some are filled with air.  When the lancet is placed on them, they recede under the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet will not open the vein.  If it does open the vein, it will only be a small opening.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be firm and careful in all these matters. Then he should lower the lancet. If the vein opens on that attempt, then he should do so. Otherwise, he should try again slightly below or above that spot.  If the area has not swelled, he should do so quickly.
If the patient swells or suffers a spasm, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage.  For it might bring about a hot swelling.  He should not enter the bathhouse.  Then he can repeat the phlebotomy if he wants. If the lancet penetrated and the opening was small and the flow of blood was thin...
And fear that not the desired amount of blood will be released.  Therefore, reinsert the lancet into the same hole gently in a straight line and slightly enlarge the opening. Do this quickly before the area swells, because in many people, the area may swell with a small opening.
If you see that it has swollen, do not return to it at all. It will not help you. Apply something from the clarified oil, for it facilitates the flow of blood. It is better in this place than the oil itself and other ointments.  Likewise.
Use clarified oil in all your venesections when the flow of blood is difficult.  The 'Faruq' remedy and 'Shukhznaya' may also do this.  If one of these is placed on the area, the blood will thin and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of the venesection (which often happens, especially for someone who has not been bled before, or if the vein opening was small), quickly apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the swelling and bind it for an hour.  It will dissolve.
This should be done after the blood has completely exited the vein itself or another vein. If, after a few days, some dark or greenish discoloration remains at the site, it will not harm. If you wish, apply something from the dissolved gentian and mastic.
Or something from the juice of the Foudjing and the like.  A swelling and protuberance often occurs when bleeding the Basilic vein. Place your hand upon it.  If you find it pulsates when you press on it, that is a bad protuberance. Be cautious about applying anything mentioned above to it.
For it may bleed arterial blood, but bandage it with something constricting to solidify the area, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.  One should draw blood from each person according to their strength and the prevailing color of their blood.
If the blood is dark, allow it to flow until it becomes red. Similarly, if it appears thick, let it flow until it becomes thin; and if it is sharp, let it flow until its sharpness subsides.  This is appropriate for someone who is robust and strong and requires a single extraction of blood.
For someone strong, widen the vein incision, and make the lancet wide.  For the weak, do the opposite.  The blood should be extracted in stages, and the puncture should be narrow.  The best tool for vein incision is a slanted, oblique slit, not a piercing one.
This type of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and nerve damage.  It is better and safer than bloodletting across or lengthwise. If fainting occurs during bloodletting, the patient should be given something to eat beforehand, such as bread soaked in pomegranate juice or vinegar.
If the patient is free of fever and the blood is extracted in three or four stages, and if the patient is cold-natured, then they should take bread soaked in myrrh drink, or honey drink perfumed with fragrant herbs, or aromatic herbal drink, before bloodletting.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and the cause is excessive blood loss, then the patient should be given meat broth and a thin herbal drink.  Perfume with rosewater should be used, and the chest should be rinsed with it.  All other treatments mentioned in the section on fainting should be employed.
This is from vomiting.  As for someone who wishes to relieve their arm and release their blood again, if the bloodletting was for excessive vomiting and the strength is weak, the blood should be released little by little, according to strength, over several days.
For someone who wants to relieve their arm and release their blood again, and whose body is strong, let them do so after seven or nine hours of the initial bloodletting.  And for someone who wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite side where it tended, let them be relieved on the second or third day.
If a person has a lot of blood in their body, it has become hot and inflamed, and caused a fever, then blood should be extracted in a single, large quantity, and the opening should be widened until fainting occurs, after having checked all the conditions of bloodletting. Place your hand on their pulse while the blood is flowing, to prevent death from occurring instead of fainting.  This often happens if the bloodletter is unaware and carelessness occurs.  This should not be done if you wish to loosen the arm and release the blood again.
If the vein opening closes and blood flow is difficult, do not press hard or twist forcefully.  That is very bad.  Instead, either leave it until it can be opened again, or use the scalpel blade to remove the clotted blood from the vein opening.
Or apply something dissolved in water, perhaps some antidote, or some other substance, and gently prod it until the blood flows. If the vein is swollen, leave it alone.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If, however, further bloodletting is absolutely necessary, either open a new vein above the affected spot, or open a vein in the other arm or elsewhere.
As for bloodletting from the arm, it is done in place of bloodletting from the eye or temple if those are unavailable or hidden, because the arm vein is made up of them.  To do this, the patient should put their hand in hot water until the forearm turns red and the vein is clearly visible.  Then, a bandage should be tied around it with a medium tightness.
Then, open the vein slightly off-center, neither lengthwise nor across, and make the opening wide.  Cut the vein slightly above the wrist joint. If the blood does not flow, put the arm back into the warm water container and let the blood flow into the water.
Until you have reached your desired amount.  If it is summer, you may not need to return the arm to warm water.  Most often, the arm is placed in warm water during winter.  This vein is the safest of all veins for bloodletting. Because there is no vein or nerve directly beneath it.  As for bloodletting from the right-hand's ulnar vein, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  To do this, tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand after placing the arm in warm water until the vein swells.
Because there is no vein or nerve directly beneath it.  As for bloodletting from the right-hand's ulnar vein, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  To do this, tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand after placing the arm in warm water until the vein swells. It will be very apparent to the touch, then you should make the opening slightly off-center.  Even if you cut it completely, that will not harm him.  Be careful; do not use the lancet too forcefully, because underneath is the nerve of the fingers, and the area is exposed with little flesh.  Then, return the arm to warm water.
And leave the blood to flow. If you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein and cease flowing.  When you have extracted the needed amount of blood, place a mixture of ointment and salt on the vein to prevent it from closing up quickly.
The same should be done with every narrow vein.  As for the benefits of bloodletting from the left hand, it is beneficial for spleen ailments.  The procedure for bloodletting from this vein is the same as for the second, or ulnar, vein.  Bloodletting from the saphenous vein is beneficial for ailments in the lower body, such as ailments of the uterus.
And for menstrual retention, kidney ailments, chronic sores on the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.  The method for bloodletting is to place the leg in warm water and apply massage until the veins are dilated.  Then, tie above the joint of the leg with a bandage, and the vein is located near the heel, visible near the big toe.
Many branches extend from it in the direction of the leg.  Bloodletting should be performed in the widest branch, or at the heel where it joins, as this is the safest and best option.  If you bleed in the part of the leg facing outward, be cautious of the nerves beneath the surface of the leg.
Make your incision with a twisting motion, as if you were about to amputate, and use a sharp lancet. If the blood is difficult to extract, return the leg to warm water and allow the blood to flow until it is depleted. If the phlebotomist misses the vein on the first attempt.
If the phlebotomist misses the vein, re-approach the incision slightly higher.  The area is safe, if the nerve is avoided as we said.  The same goes for the saphenous vein of the other leg. As for the femoral vein, its location is, as we said, at the heel on the outer side.
Its usefulness for hip pain, if it arises from hot blood, is as follows:  Have the afflicted person enter a warm bath and quickly apply firm pressure with four fingers on the leg from the hip up to the heel with a long, thin bandage. It will only show itself in this manner.
If it appears, bleed it in any way; either by twisting (which is preferable), or by cutting off a portion, or by making a slit.  The area is safe.  It is very hidden in most people, if you do not find it.
If it does not appear at all, then bleed some of its branches, which appear on the back of the foot near the little and ring fingers.  Be mindful of the nerves, and draw off the amount of blood desired.
Then, release the pressure, place a cotton pad on the incision site, and bandage the area.  It will quickly heal.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On cupping and its use.
Cupping vessels can be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass.  Cupping can be done in two ways: one by applying a ligature and drawing blood, and the other without a ligature.
And this cupping without a ligature is of two types.
And the cupping of the collarbones, which are the sides of the neck on both sides, and the cupping of the chin, which is below the lower jaw of the mouth, and the cupping of the shoulders, and the cupping of the coccyx on the tailbone, and the cupping of the elbows, which are the middle of the forearms, and the cupping of the legs, and the cupping of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the delicate veins spread throughout the flesh.  Therefore, it does not weaken the body like bloodletting, and cupping, whether with or without fire, should not be used in any illness arising from fullness until the entire body is emptied.
If cupping is needed due to illness or custom, we use it at all times, at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time.
For some people, when blood increases to the point where cupping is needed, they experience heaviness and headaches in their head.  Others experience fullness, redness in their face, head, and neck. Some experience itching on their face, temples, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.  And some itch the site of the cupping.
Some laugh excessively, some taste blood in their mouths, gums bleed, and they spit up blood. Some sleep excessively, and some see blood, redness, slain people, and wounds, and the like in their dreams.  When we see any of this...
Especially if it occurs in the middle third of the month, we order cupping after two or three hours have passed of the day.  The benefit of cupping the temple is for heaviness in the head and water dripping into the eyes.
However, this should be done after the body has been emptied.  This cupping may be a substitute for venesection of the temples.  One should avoid using it if they have a cold head or a cold, as it will cause them great harm.
Therefore, elderly people and those with cold illnesses in the head should not use it.  And those who frequently use it develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should lower the cup slightly to avoid the development of forgetfulness.  As for cupping the shoulder, it is a substitute for venesection of the temples and venesection of the sides of the head.
Therefore, it is helpful for asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory apparatus, coughing, and fullness.  The shoulder cupping should be raised slightly, because if it is placed too low, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it is helpful for headaches, eye diseases, migraine, choking, toothache at the roots of the teeth.  It is a substitute for venesection of the sides of the head.  The cupper should be instructed not to insert the instrument too deeply into the skin lest they cut an artery and cause bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it is helpful for mouth ulcers, gum disease, and similar mouth ailments.  It can take the place of venesection of the corners of the lips.  As for cupping the shoulders, it is helpful for palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
As for cupping the hollows of the forearms, it is helpful for what venesection of the three veins—the basilic, the temporal, and the cephalic—is helpful, because it draws blood from all those thin veins in the flesh and draws those thin veins from other, thicker veins, until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to press the instrument too forcefully, for the area is lacking in flesh, and has nerves and arteries underneath. As for a single cupping on the coccyx, it is helpful for piles and sores of the lower region.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large, brass cupping vessel, because the area needs strong suction, and glass cupping vessels may break.  The cupping should be performed thoroughly.  As for cupping the legs, it clearly reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, it induces menstruation, and is beneficial for boils and abscesses. It can replace venesection of the safens and saphenous veins, but it greatly exhausts the body, and fainting occurs in most people.  Cupping of the saphenous veins has a benefit similar to cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping is to first place the empty cupping vessel and apply moderate suction, but do not prolong the application of cupping; rather place and remove it quickly, to allow the humors to flow evenly to the location.  Continue this process, until the area becomes red and open.
When the redness of the blood appears, then the cupping should be applied gently and repeatedly. Then, the condition of the bodies should be observed; those with thin, porous flesh should be cupped only once to prevent the area from becoming ulcerated.
The cupper should widen the cupping, deepen it slightly, and apply gentle, light suction. If the blood is thick, the cupping should be performed twice. The first time, to open a passage for the thin, watery blood, and the second, to remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, the cupping should be repeated a third time to achieve the goal.  In general, if we want to remove a small amount of blood, one incision is sufficient.  If we want to remove a large amount, we make more incisions, if we judge the blood to be thick.
A deep incision should be made, the moderate depth being only the skin.  What ointments should be used for cupping, and what waters, and what should the cupper avoid?  For those with thick, hard, dry skin and narrow pores...
The areas for cupping should be smeared with softening, dissolving, opening ointments.  In summer, for example, the ointment of the *khairī* (a type of fragrant wood resin), or the ointment of violet, or sweet almond, or pumpkin seed ointment.
In winter, ointments like narcissus, lily, chamomile, or hyacinth, and similar ones.  If the blood is thick and cold, then use ointments like marjoram, anise, benzoin, or rue, and similar ones.
If the cupper has wide pores and soft flesh, then the ointment should be avoided.  These people should wash their cupping vessels after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or elderberry water, or gourd water, or watercress water, and similar ones.  As for those whose blood is excessively moist...
They should wash their cupping vessels with vinegar, or rue and sumac water, and similar ones.  As for those whose blood is thick, they should wash their cupping vessels with old wine, or marjoram water, or rue or chamomile decoction, and similar ones.  Cupping should be avoided in the bath and after the bath.
Instead, it should be used an hour or two after leaving the bath.  One should not sleep after cupping.  This is what the cupper and the blood-letter should consider before and after cupping.
First, one must consider if the cupper or blood-letter is bilious, and their blood is predominantly sharp and inflammatory.  Then they should take cooling things like pomegranate, dandelion in vinegar, endive, vinegar and rose water, and similar things.  Their foods should be fowl, lamb, lean meat, and similar things.
If their temperament is cold, they should be given honeyed drinks, or pomegranate molasses, or spiced vinegar, and they should drink moderate aromatic wine, somewhere between old and new.  They should be given little food, and their diet should consist of poultry, quails, sparrows, and doves, lean and tender.  The drink on the day of cupping and blood-letting should be more than the food.
Sometimes, some people should be given a restorative antidote or musk medicine or shilah medicine before cupping and before or after blood-letting to strengthen the major organs and thin the blood.  This should not be given to the feverish.
As for cupping without stipulations, these are cuppings placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney area, and hip joints, because these organs cannot tolerate a stipulation.  The purpose is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
For example, placing a cupping on the breasts in cases of catarrh, or we use it to remove cold wind that may have accumulated in an organ, like placing a cupping on the abdomen and navel; it loosens the organ, warms it, and removes the pain by dissolving that wind.
It can also be placed on the kidneys if a blockage or stones appear there; by the strength of its suction, it may open the blockage or remove the stones from their place.  Likewise, it does this when placed on the liver and spleen in cases of wind that afflicts them.  These cuppings can also be used empty, by suction alone.
It can be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water in cases of gout.  This is done by filling a large cupping with hot water alone, or water in which certain herbs suitable for this have been boiled.
Then, filled, it is placed on the affected area, held, and removed, repeated as needed. This is the form of cupping that is used with fire.
Its opening is the size of two open fingers, as we have depicted, and its depth is half a span.  On one side, about halfway down, there is a small hole to fit a needle, made from thick-rimmed Chinese or brass.
Smooth, level, and polished so as not to harm the organ when placed on it, and a transverse notch of brass or iron is in the middle, where the candle is placed over fire.  This cupping can be made larger or smaller than described, depending on the illness.
The user's skill is important; cupping for children and thin people is not the same as for men and those with large frames.  As for how to apply this cupping with fire to the affected area, a wick of tightly wound linen or a small pitch candle is lit and placed on the hardened rod in the center of the cupping.
So that the fire ascends from the top towards the bottom of the cupping, to avoid burning the patient's body. Then it is placed on the affected area, and the finger is placed on the hole we mentioned, so that when we hold the cupping, we do not need to remove the finger.
Steam will emerge from that hole and the cupping will be released on the spot.  Then the wick is rekindled as needed.  However, a cupping used for dropsy does not have a hardened rod or a hole.
Instead, it is used by filling it with water and placing it directly on the affected area.  This is its depiction:
The larger the cupping, the more water it can hold, the better it is.
Chapter Ninety-seven.
On the application of leeches.
Leeches are used mostly on parts of the body where cupping cannot be applied, either because they are small, such as the lip, gums, and the like, or because the area is bare of flesh, like the finger and nose, and so on.
To use them, select leeches from clear, uncontaminated freshwater.  Then, leave them in fresh water for a day and night to make them hungry and empty their stomachs. Then, the body is first bled, or cupped, and then the affected area is cleansed.
Until it turns red, then a leech is placed on it.  If it fills up and falls off, this is effective.  If possible, cupping the area is more beneficial; otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze. If bleeding persists after the leech has fallen off, and it is a seepage, then soak a linen cloth in cold water.
Place it over the area until the seepage stops. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered alum or dried dates, or similar astringents, on the area to stop the bleeding, or place peeled halves of broad beans on the spot.
Leave it until the broad beans stick to the area; then the bleeding will stop.  If further leeches are needed, and other leeches are available, do not use the same ones. If the leeches refuse to attach, the area should be cleaned with fresh blood.
Or, pierce the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then place a leech. If it feels blood, it will attach to the spot.  If you want to remove it, sprinkle some sorrel, salt, or ash on it, and it will detach from the spot.
Chapter Three.
On Fractures.
This chapter also deals with the necessary aspects of medical practice concerning the setting of fractures and dislocations of bones.
Know, my children, that many ignorant physicians and lay people may claim expertise in this area, those who have never examined the writings of the ancients or read a single word from them.
For this reason, this art of medicine has become extinct in our land, and I have never encountered a single proficient practitioner in it. My knowledge of it was gained through extensive study of the writings of the ancients and my diligent efforts to understand them, from which I extracted this knowledge.  Then, I committed myself to practice and skill throughout my life.
I have presented to you in this chapter everything my knowledge encompasses. My experience has refined it for you, removing superfluous detail and condensing it to the utmost brevity, clarifying it to the greatest extent, and presenting numerous examples of the instruments used in it.
This is an addition to the clarity, as I did in the preceding two chapters. There is no power except from God, the Most High, the Great.
The first chapter.
This chapter contains general principles concerning the breaking of bones. Before we begin to discuss individual fractured and dislocated limbs, it is necessary to present some general observations and sections in the beginning of this chapter. This will first compel you to understand and grasp its reality, you and any others who are eager to learn this noble craft.
If a person suffers a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, one must first apply poultices or laxatives, or both. Unless prevented by factors such as weakness, or if the person involved is a child or an elderly person, or if the weather is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, his diet should be limited to cold legumes, poultry, and venison.  Drinks, fatty meats, overeating, and any food that causes a surge of blood to the veins should be avoided, until swelling subsides and the outflow of fluid to the affected area is expected to cease.
Then, the patient should return to his usual regimen.  If the broken bone begins to knit, the patient should eat substantial, thick, and viscous foods such as hulled barley, rice, heads of barley, and the stomachs of oxen. Eggs, soft fish, and thick broths, and similar foods, will promote a quicker and better healing of the fracture.  Know that broken bones in strong men and the elderly will not always heal completely.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, bones that are exceptionally pliable, like those of young children, may fuse.  However, nature forms a substance around the broken bone, resembling glue, with sufficient thickness to hold it together and secure the fragments.
So that it attains the same strength and stability as before, and nothing impedes its function.
Therefore, the patient's diet should include foods with strength, viscosity, and thickness, as mentioned.  Know that fractures vary depending on the affected body part, for a fracture of the leg differs from a fracture of the head, and a fracture of the chest differs from a fracture of the back.
Likewise, all other parts of the body differ from each other. We will describe each type of fracture in detail in its own section, and the type of bone fracture can also vary within itself.
Because it may be a fractured break without splinters, or it may be a break along the bone, resulting in splinters and detached or non-detached fragments.  The fracture may accompany a wound or tear in the skin, or be a slight crack.
Each type requires a specific method of reduction, which will be detailed later in its appropriate place.  Signs of a broken bone include its deformity, unevenness, visibility to the touch, and the creaking sound when you press it with your hand.
If there is no visible deformity, no creaking, no feeling of disturbance when touching the bone, and the patient experiences little pain, then there is no fracture, but rather a strain, a minor fracture, or a minor crack.  Under these circumstances, the bone should not be moved by pulling or probing at all.
Instead, apply the appropriate medications, which will be described later, to the affected area and gently bind it.  Know that when a bone is fractured and splintered, but no fragments are created, each part may have moved away from its original position.
You should promptly realign and straighten it before a hot swelling develops.  If a hot swelling does appear, leave it for several days until it subsides, then realign it by any method of gentle manipulation that you can employ.
Know that reduction and realignment are easier when there are no fragments in the bone.  Then apply the appropriate bandage, as will be described later.  If there are fragments, the fractured limb (either an arm or a leg) must be stretched from both ends.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with both ropes and hands, position the limb on a flat surface in its natural shape.  Once the fractured bone parts have been stretched, reposition any protruding pieces in their proper places using any method of gentle manipulation.
Strive to avoid causing pain or discomfort to the patient with your actions.  Do your utmost to join the two bone parts together in the best possible alignment.  At that time, you should touch and feel them with your hand.  If you find anything abnormal, correct and realign it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive stretching and forceful prodding, as many ignorant people do.  Often, their actions cause a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb, as I have witnessed repeatedly.
After the realignment, careful adjustment, and stretching, keep the limb still and at rest. Warn the patient not to move it during wakefulness, sleep, turning over, or restlessness, during bowel movements, and with all his movements as much as possible.  He should ensure that the position of the limb is one that prevents pain.
If, in that position, the patient feels pain or discomfort in the limb, he should move it to a position where he does not feel pain.  Furthermore, he must ensure that this new position is straight and aligned.
So that no deformity occurs in the limb if it is straightened.  Regarding the method of stretching a fractured limb, as I describe to you, know that fractured limbs differ in size, degree of injury, and characteristics.  Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and similar parts, ...
The bandages should be soft and gentle for small parts like the arm and fingers.  For larger parts like the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be firm and strong, because a broad bandage is necessary for a large limb, stretching it equally from all sides without any flaws.
Then, after completing the alignment, apply the appropriate plaster. With a soft, gentle pressure, begin by wrapping the bandage around the fracture site three or four times, depending on the limb's requirements.  Slightly tighten the bandage, then move it to the upper part of the fracture.
With less tension than you used on the fractured area, gradually move the wrapping away from the fracture site, loosening the tension slightly until it aligns correctly.  Then take another bandage and wrap it around the fractured area as well.
Wrap again, then move the wrapping towards the lower part of the fracture.  Maintain the tension and looseness as described in the first wrap, above.  Place soft pads or cloths between the layers to correct any misalignment of the fracture.
If there is misalignment, correct it; otherwise, do not add anything.  Then wrap with another bandage.  Finally, apply firm splints over these layers, if the limb shows no swelling or inflammation.
If there is swelling or inflammation, apply something to reduce the swelling and inflammation. Leave it for several days, then apply splints.  The splints may be made from cut and prepared pieces of flat reeds, or from ebony wood.
Made from pine, palm leaves, reeds, or similar readily available materials.  Maintain the same dimensions and shape for each splint.
However, the splint directly over the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others.  The splint's length should be appropriate to the size of the fractured limb.  Image of the splint:
Then, tighten the splints with another bandage, using the same level of tension as the first.  Secure with strong threads from above, ensuring that the tension over the fracture site is greater. The less the tension as you move away from the fracture.
The threads should be of medium thickness and softness, preferably made from damp linen.  If the threads are thick, like those made by ignorant people from twisted linen strips, this is a serious error.
Because the tension will be unbalanced with those threads.  Thin threads are also unsuitable, as they will not achieve the desired tension.  There should be no less than a finger's width between the splints.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after applying the correct tension, place soft padding or fluffy wool underneath to prevent any discomfort.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and the skin is punctured, we will discuss this separately.
Know that not every fractured limb needs splints from the first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be applied until five or seven days, or more, depending on your assurance that inflammation will not occur.
This is a description of the dressings used by the ancients to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  It is a general, concise dressing that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is not affected by heat or cold.
Take the flour dust, the residue from the grinding stone, knead it as it is, without sifting it with egg white.  Make the dough neither thick nor thin, then bake it.
Another dressing for fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take ten dirhams each of mastic, frankincense, acacia, raisin, and rose-water extract.  Take five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe, and twenty dirhams of acacia wood.  Use twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman clay. Grind all the ingredients together and mix with acacia water or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot.  Then use this dressing.  It is well-suited, quickly sets broken bones, and is suitable for most people due to its balanced nature.
Another dressing useful for fractures and sprains: take ten dirhams each of rose-water extract, mastic, and white hellebore; five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe; six dirhams of acacia; and twenty dirhams of Armenian clay.  Grind all thoroughly, sift, and knead with water or egg white. Apply.
A dressing for dislocated joints and bones, relieving pain from throbbing and fractures: take softened wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply to the affected area. This dressing does not have the power to set bones.
However, it is excellent for relieving hot swelling and pain.  Another dressing to set a broken bone: take prickly fig leaves and wild poppy leaves, grind them together, and apply them moist. Another concise dressing for setting a fractured bone.
To treat the remaining swelling, take equal parts of hellebore root, chamomile, violet, and chickpea flour. Grind all together and mix with paint if the limb is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, mix with coriander water or water and apply.
A stronger dressing for resolving the swelling that occurs after bone displacement: take equal parts of hellebore root, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, violet, and chamomile.
Grind all together and mix with vinegar water, fresh water, or paint, according to the heat of the limb and the reduction of its heat.  Hippocrates did not mention applying this to a fractured limb during the setting process in his writings.
Except for the ointment made from wax and oil, nothing else.  It should be of medium consistency, neither thick nor thin.  Galen believed that things with a drying effect and some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, should be applied to the fractured limb during the setting process.
A dressing for weakness and pain:  take equal parts of mugwort, chickpeas, shaved human hair (or bird feathers), hellebore, and salt.  Grind, sift, mix, and apply as a dressing.  The appropriate amount for the ligament should remain.
Then, consider the situation. If the patient does not experience pain, rubbing, or displacement of the fractured bone, do not remove the dressing for many days. If the affected area experiences severe rubbing, disturbing pain, or swelling, then remove the dressing.
Then, promptly remove the dressing immediately, do not delay.  Take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the rubbing and pain subside. Then, allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Then, apply softened wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and wrap it around the area overnight. This will help ease the hot swelling, reduce limb puffiness, and alleviate pain.  Then, apply gentle traction and a light dressing, but do not apply the initial level of tension.
Treat it gently until healed.  If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness, and all symptoms have completely disappeared, and a dressing and traction are needed, then reapply them as you did initially.  However, if nothing mentioned above has occurred on the limb.
Do not remove the dressing for three, four, five, or seven days.  Sometimes, twenty days may be needed.  All this depends on the condition of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture heals and the flesh begins to knit together.
Increase the traction then, beyond your initial level, and also increase the patient's diet, as previously mentioned. If you see that the fracture site has become excessively dry and emaciated, understand that the nourishment is not reaching it.
Unwrap it with lukewarm water each time you remove the dressing, every three days.  Slightly reduce the traction.  This will allow nourishment to reach the limb, and it will heal quickly.  As for what the unskilled among the bone setters do, of breaking the limb again...
For if it is not properly set at first, and is set crooked, that is a mistake.  A great deception.  Even if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it.  I have seen no trace of this among them. The correct approach is not to use it.
Chapter Two.
Concerning fractures occurring in the head.
Fractures of the head are numerous and varied in form, with diverse causes. Some fractures result from sword blows, and in these cases, the bone may break completely, reaching down to the peritoneum lying beneath the bone. As happens in wood when it is split.
And so, this type of fracture is called a splintering fracture.  Alternatively, the sword might only sever a portion of the bone, fracturing only one side, without penetrating the bone completely. This type of fracture is called a simple fracture, and the wound in either case may be large or small.
Other fractures are caused by crushing or contusion, resulting from a blow with a stone, a fall onto a stone, or similar. This type of fracture may either penetrate the membrane beneath the bone or affect only the surface of the bone.
The wound in these fractures may also be large or small. Some fractures are hidden within the bone, like a very slight crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.  One such fracture occurs from a fall or a blow with a stone or similar, where a portion of the bone's surface is driven inwards, causing the area to become concave, just as a piece of copper would be dented if struck.
This is most common in the spongy skull, like those of children.  All these types of fractures may have detached or non-detached fragments.  We will describe the treatment for all of this in its proper place.  All these types of fractures can be identified through examination.
Inspecting them with probes and removing any corrupted flesh.  A hairline fracture is identified by examining the bone, rubbing and staining it with ink; the fracture will appear black.  Regarding fracture treatment, first consider the patient's symptoms.
If you observe clear symptoms of danger, such as vomiting bile, prostration, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, redness and bulging of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach or treat the patient, for in most cases, death is inevitable with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that are not alarming and hope for recovery, then proceed with treatment.  This is if the injured person comes to you at the earliest possible time after the injury, especially during winter.
In any case, you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day.  If it is during summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane beneath the bone is corrupted, leading to the symptoms we described.
If the fractured bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and is accompanied by fragmentation and contusion, you should cut away the fragmented and contused portion, as I describe to you: shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, according to the shape of the wound and the patient's comfort. If, during the exposure of the bone, you see bleeding or a hot swelling, deal with it as necessary.
This means: pack the area with cloths soaked in rosewater and ointment, and cauterize the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding stops.  Then, proceed to manipulate and remove the bone, using one of two methods.
One method is to cut the bone with a narrow, sharp incision.  This is its image/form.
Then, use another incision, slightly wider than the first.  This is its image/form.
Then, use yet another incision, wider still than the second.  You should have a set of various incisions, some wider than others, some shorter than others, and extremely sharp.  These should be made of Indian steel or good quality فولاد.
Use gentle force when striking the incision to avoid jarring the head and causing further injury.  If the bone is strong and firm, it should first be pierced around the area before using the incisions with instruments called *mithāqib ghayr ghā'isa* (non-dipping drills).
Because they do not penetrate the skull bone beyond its limits.  The drill has a rounded edge, below its sharp head, like a ring or small circle, preventing it from sinking into and passing through the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone.  For each skull, you need a drill with a sharp point whose length and shortness correspond to the thickness of that skull.  This is the image of three types. Of drills: large, medium, and small.
To drill around the fractured bone, place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated. Then, move the drill to another location, leaving a space between each hole equal to the thickness of a rod or similar.
Then, cut between each two holes using the chisels, with as much gentleness as possible, as we have stated.  This is done so you can remove the bone either with your hand or with some other tool that has been prepared for this purpose.
Like sponges and delicate pliers.  You must be extremely careful that the drill or chisel does not touch any of the peritoneum.  If you have smoothed the bone and separated it from any adhering peritoneum and removed it, then it must be cleaned.
Smooth any roughness remaining on the bone with another tool similar to the chisel, but it must be thinner and gentler than the other chisels.  If any small pieces of bone or splinters remain, remove them gently with the tools you have.
Then, treat the wound afterwards with the dressings and ointments that will be mentioned.  The other approach to this procedure is quite straightforward, free of risk, and was praised highly by Galen.  This is what he said. First, you should begin by exposing the portion of the bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent.  Once you have exposed that section, you should place the tip of this lentil-shaped chisel underneath it.  This is its image/shape.
The lentil-shaped part of it should be smooth, so as not to cut anything.  The sharp part of it, with its pointed ends extending lengthwise, as you see, should be positioned so that the lentil-shaped part rests on the peritoneum and the sharp edge of the chisel is against the bone. Then strike the chisel from one side.
With a small hammer, so that you cut through all the bone gently, as it turns, and you are safe from injuring the membrane; no frightful accident will occur, even if the practitioner is the most ignorant and timid of people, indeed, even if he were asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some areas, scrape it off using the tip of the lentil-shaped chisel itself, gently removing it.  It will come off without harm or fear.
If the fracture of the bone did not reach the membrane, and the broken surface of the bone remained rough with small fragments, then you should remove those roughnesses and fragments using various small tools of different sizes, so that you may use the one most suitable for each area, according to what the work dictates.
The broken bone itself and its shape should be considered.  You should first use the widest of these tools to clean the bone, then use a narrower one after that, and continue this process, gradually working your way down to the use of the finest and most delicate ones.
As for the smaller, hairline fractures and slight breaks, each should be treated in a manner appropriate for its repair.  This is something obvious to anyone with even a basic understanding of this craft and who has grasped what we have written and explained regarding major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a linen cloth sized to the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.  Then take another cloth, folded or triangular. Soak it in rosewater and rose oil, place it on the first cloth, and do this with as little weight as possible, so as not to burden the peritoneum.  Then apply a wide bandage over this, tightening it only enough to hold the wound in place.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two, until the hot swelling subsides.  Then remove it and use afterwards the drying remedies like iris roots, chamomile flour, coriander powder, and zira, and similar things.  Make a paste from these remedies.
Dust the wound with it, as it is dry.  Generally, use a remedy that cleanses without stinging.  Strive, during the treatment of the wound, to keep it clean, free from grease, dirt, and do not allow pus to collect in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the brain membrane, it corrupts and rots it, causing a great calamity for the patient.  This can occur in the lining of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If a dark discoloration appears on its surface, and if the patient shows the symptoms we have mentioned, know that he is doomed.  And if the discoloration was caused by a medicine applied to it, and if the strength of that medicine is such that it causes this discoloration.
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well, and apply them to the cloth, then place the cloth on the lining. Then treat it with the appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Three.
In the setting of a broken nose.
Know that only the upper portions of the nose, either both or one, can fracture, because they are bones. The lower part is cartilage, and therefore does not fracture, but may be bruised, bent, or perforated.
If one side of the nose is fractured, you should insert the little finger into the nasal opening.  Straighten the fracture from the inside with your index finger and from the outside with your thumb, until the nose is restored to its natural shape.  Do this gently, ensuring you do not cause pain to the patient.
If the fracture is high up on the nose and cannot be reached by the finger, it should be straightened with a blunt, slightly thick instrument.  If the fracture is in both sides, do likewise.  The reduction should be performed on the first day after the fracture.
If possible, or else after seven or ten days, when the acute swelling has subsided, insert a linen thread into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two threads if it is on both sides.
The threads should be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some earlier bone setters say to soak the threads in ghee and change them daily.  I, however, do not think this is necessary.  The threads should be soaked in beaten egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the threads until the bone is set and the cartilage is solidified.  After the threads are in place, you may insert goose feather tubes wrapped in soft linen into the nose, to further hold the fractured nose in place and to prevent difficulty for the patient in breathing.
This is not essential; if you wish, do it, or if you wish, use the threads.  If a hot swelling develops on the nose during your treatment, bandage the nose with gauze or cotton soaked in vinegar, rose oil, or some kind of diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling appears, it is advisable to bandage the outside with semolina flour and powdered kandar mixed with egg white, then place a soft bandage on top. Do not bandage the nose at all if the nasal bones are fractured into small pieces.
Or if it splintered, you should cut through it and remove it with the appropriate instrument. Then stitch the wound and treat it with healing ointments suitable for the purpose. If a wound occurs inside the nose, you should treat it with threads and use lead tubes. Until it heals.
Fourth Chapter.
On setting the lower jaw if fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured, and the fracture is not accompanied by a visible wound, if the fracture is only from the outside and did not break in two and has bent inwards, then its identification is easier.
If the fracture is in the right half, one should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth.  Likewise, if the fracture is in the left half, insert the index finger of the right hand and gently lift the fractured prominence from inside to outside.
Your other hand, on the outside of the bone, controls its alignment.  If the jaw fracture has broken into two pieces, it is necessary to use traction from both sides in a straight line until its alignment is achieved. If it has affected the teeth, they should be treated.
Or if any part is expected to separate, tie it with a gold, silver, or silk thread.  Then, place a bandage on the fractured jaw, followed by a folded cloth.  Put a large, tight bandage or a piece of leather, the same length as the jaw, over the cloth. Then, tie it from above in a way that suits its joining, ensuring it does not come undone.  Order the patient to rest and abstain from strenuous activity.  Give the patient soft foods. If you suspect a change in the fracture's condition in any way, proceed to address it on the third day.
Then, tie it from above in a way that suits its joining, ensuring it does not come undone.  Order the patient to rest and abstain from strenuous activity.  Give the patient soft foods. If you suspect a change in the fracture's condition in any way, proceed to address it on the third day. Then, repair the bandage with flour from a millstone mixed with egg white or semolina, after removing the bandage. Place a soft padding over the bandage.  As long as the bandage adheres and the bone condition does not change, leave it in place.
Do not remove it until the fracture heals and strengthens.  This fracture often strengthens in three weeks.  If a hot swelling appears during that time, use the remedies we have previously mentioned to calm it until it subsides.
If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, examine it. If a piece or pieces of bone have separated, gently remove them with the appropriate instruments. If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as needed.
Then, if you have removed all the bone fragments, close the wound opening if it is wide, or apply one of the appropriate ointments if it is not. And heal the wound until it is healed.
Chapter Five.
On setting a fractured clavicle.
The clavicle is most often fractured in front, from the acromial end.  Its fracture can occur in one of three ways: either it fractures and splinters into two pieces without causing splintering, which is easiest to reduce;
Or the fracture may involve splintering, which is more difficult to reduce; or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound.  If the fracture is without a wound, have two assistants; one should hold the arm next to the fractured clavicle, and the other should stretch the neck towards the opposite side.
Then, straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct and there are no protrusions or irregularities. If you need more traction, place a ball of linen or wool under the patient's armpit.
Use as much traction as needed, stretching and raising the clavicle, pressing the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot draw the clavicle outward because it has become recessed, the patient should lie on their back.
A moderate-sized pillow is placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses down on the shoulder to raise the recessed clavicle.  Then you should correct and straighten the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a piece of the clavicle has fractured and is moving, you must carefully separate and remove that piece. If the fragment is lodged in the bone, use one of the specialized instruments to remove it. After placing the instrument that supports the diaphragm (it is made of wood or iron), which is depicted as follows:
It resembles a spoon without a curve, its width adjusted to the size of the bone, and its length to the work needed. It should have two ends; one wider and the other narrower, as you see.
If the wound you made to remove the bone fragment is wide and inflammation is present, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures. If the wound is minor, or if you fear severe inflammation, treat the wound with a superficial incision and splints, corresponding to the size of the wound opening.
If there is a hot inflammation, apply the dressing soaked in rose oil and vinegar or potion.  If the bone is dislocated without a wound or incision, apply a dressing made of mill dust mixed with egg white to the bone. Place a soft splint on it, then place a ball under his armpit if needed.  Then take a very long turban, about a span wide or so, and place a folded splint over the splint and dressing.  Then take a splint made of thin board. Its width should be three fingers, and its length the same. Then wrap it in a cloth, and wrap that cloth with the splint in the part of the turban that lies over the fracture site. Then tighten the turban around the fracture as you would tie a bandage. Hold it around his neck and under his healthy armpit and under his injured armpit, returning it repeatedly to each side.  How you see that the tension ensures a firm hold on the fracture is something you understand.
The whole point is that the splint should not move from the fractured bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient daily.  Whenever the ligaments loosen and you see the splint has shifted, correct this and tighten the bandage. Then, have the patient sleep on their back, and place a small pillow under their armpit at night.
So that his arm is raised from his side, causing the clavicle fracture to rise with the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck.  Do not loosen the bandage unless a wound or swelling occurs at the site within twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. Maintain the pressure and leave it until the clavicle fracture is set and firm, and it strengthens further in twenty-eight days. It may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
In the setting of a fractured shoulder.  The shoulder rarely fractures in its broad region, but rather in its processes.  If it fractures in one of these regions or in the middle, this is determined by touch.  Then, based on the nature of the fracture, apply a splint.
Reduce it and restore it to its natural shape by every means possible, then apply mill dust with egg white and soft plaster.  Place a folded cloth over this, and then apply a broad splint made of wood.
Make it as wide as the entire shoulder, or slightly wider.  If there is a depression under the splint in any part of the shoulder, smooth out that depression with soft plaster until the splint lies flat.  Then, secure it from above with a long bandage.
Apply a firm bandage and secure the splint so that it does not shift, and check the bandage daily.  Whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it moves out of place. The patient should lie on their healthy side, and the shoulder will be healed in twenty days.
One day or twenty-five days.  When this period is completed, remove the bandage and you will be safe, for it is one of the bones that one does not fear fracturing or dislocating.  If a piece of bone protrudes and is piercing the skin, lance it and remove it. Do what was mentioned for a broken collarbone in relieving inflammation if anything of that kind occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On the setting of fractured ribs.
The chest can fracture in the middle, though this is infrequent.  However, its ends are more often broken and fragmented.  If the middle is fractured, the symptoms include a downward inclination, severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
Sometimes blood may be expelled, and the depression in the fractured bone will be evident and palpable.  To set it, the patient should lie on their back with a pillow between their shoulders.  Then, the patient's sides should be pressed together, and the ribs brought together manually from the sides, carefully aligning them in all directions possible.
And hold it until the bone returns to its proper shape.  Then apply bandages and splints, placing a thin board of poplar, willow, or similar lightweight wood on top, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then gently secure the bandages around the fractured bone so that they do not slip.  Wind the bandage around the back in a circular motion repeatedly, tightening it firmly.  Then inspect the bandage frequently and tighten it whenever it loosens.
If the need arises to remove it due to inflammation, pain, or swelling in the area, promptly remove it, and address the issue with the appropriate treatment.  Then, if appropriate, reapply the bandage. And maintain the pressure until healed.
Chapter Eight.
Concerning the setting of fractured ribs, know that fractures occur in the thick parts of the ribs adjacent to the back, and their front ends.  Injuries occur because they are cartilaginous.  This is easily recognizable by touch when examining with the fingers.
Set it by aligning the fracture with the fingers in the best possible position until the shape is correct. Then bandage and support the broken bone with a splint if necessary. If the fracture of the ribs is angled inward, the patient will experience intense pain.
And the pain is like the pain that occurs in those with a hernia, because the bone pierces the diaphragm and also causes shortness of breath, coughing, and a large amount of blood spitting.  This is a difficult condition to treat.  The ancients devised many remedies for it.
Some have said that the patient's food should produce flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen swells and the fracture is pushed outward.  We dislike this, lest it aggravate the occurrence of inflammatory swelling. If it has not occurred, it will not cause it; but if it has already happened, it will worsen and confirm it.
Some said that a cupping device should be placed on the area and then vigorously suctioned, which is more in line with reason.  However, one fears that the cupping device might draw the fluid from elsewhere due to the weakness in the area.  Some said that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
The space between the ribs becomes filled, so the ligaments become even if you wrap it around the circumference.  Then the patient is treated for hernia with diet and medication.  If the patient is exhausted by a severe condition, they cannot endure it. The bone was piercing the diaphragm painfully, and we feared for the patient. Therefore, it is necessary to cut open the area, expose the broken rib, and then place beneath it the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which was previously described, and carefully remove the bone.
Then, if the wound is large, we bring together the edges with sutures and treat it with ointments until it heals.  If inflammatory swelling develops during this time, immediately apply rose-oil ointment to the area and treat the patient internally with remedies that alleviate the swelling.
He should lie on the side where he sleeps more easily until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture occurs, this is rare.  Most often, the neck experiences contusions.  Similarly, the vertebrae of the back are also more prone to contusions than fractures.  If this happens to someone, and you wish to know if they will recover, then examine: if you see that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and lifeless, and he is unable to move, extend, or grasp them, and if you pinch or prick them with a needle, he feels no sensation or pain, then know that in most cases he will not recover; he is doomed.
But if he can move them and feel the pinching and pricking, then know that the spinal marrow has been spared, and the patient will recover with treatment.  If a similar condition affects the vertebrae of the back, and you want to know if he will recover,
then examine his legs.  If you see that they are relaxed and the same condition has occurred in them as in the hands, and then, if he lies on his back, wind and stool pass without his will, and if he lies on his stomach, urine passes without his will, and if he lies on his back and wishes to urinate, he cannot, then know that he is doomed; do not concern yourself with his treatment.  If none of this occurs, the matter is less serious.  Treatment for what has occurred is to attempt to relieve the inflammation.
by placing rose ointment alone or with roasted egg yolks on the affected vertebrae three times a day, until the inflammation subsides. Then apply one of the strengthening, dry bandages to the area and bind it with a bandage.  Instruct him to rest and remain still.
He should sleep only on the side that does not cause him pain until he is healed.  If a splinter or something of the sort has formed from the injury to the bone, it should be necessary to cut open the skin and remove the bone. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges together with stitches, and treat with healing ointments until he is healed. If the last bone of the coccyx, the tailbone, is broken, it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the buttocks.
Adjust the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and achievable, then apply a bandage and splint if needed, and then bind it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, cut open the area and remove it, and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Fractures of the thigh bones are rare.  If they do fracture, the fracture is typically a splintering at the ends and a longitudinal splitting.  The bone will tilt inward.  The patient experiences pain, stabbing, and numbness in the affected leg.
To set it, run your hand over it to determine the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, adjust the ends of the fracture so that the bone resembles its normal shape.
If the fracture is longitudinal or has tilted inward, lay the patient on his stomach to allow the fracture to be set.  Once set, apply a bandage. Then apply a splint of wood or leather and bind tightly.
Do not fear the displacement of the fracture or the removal of the splint.  Fill the hollows around the fracture to provide a smooth surface for the splint.  Instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his sound side.  If a hot swelling appears,
Refrain from manipulating or setting it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply whatever remedies were previously mentioned to alleviate the swelling.  Then return to setting and securing the fracture as necessary.  If fragments or splinters are visible in the bone, they should not be removed.
And do not touch [the splinters]; rather, adjust the alignment from the outside as we said before.  Maintain the binding until healing occurs.
The eleventh chapter.
On setting a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, set it by one of two methods. One method is to take a smooth, slightly curved, medium-thick stick, like this:
And tie two straps at its ends. Then, suspend it from a high place, and have the patient sit on a chair.  Then, place their fractured arm on the stick until their armpit is positioned on the center of the curve of the stick. Then hang a heavy object from above it.
Or a servant supports it downwards, then the physician straightens the fracture with their hands, so as to return it to its proper position. The other method is for the patient to lie on their back, and have their arm suspended from their neck with a strap.
Then instruct two servants, one to hold what is above the fracture in his hands, and the other to hold what is below it.  Each should pull in their direction. If you wish a stronger pull, tie a strap below the fracture and one above, and have each servant pull in their direction.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, the middle of the strap should be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, the strap should be in that position and also on the elbow itself.
Then, gently straighten the fracture without force until the fracture is aligned properly and firmly joined.  Then, tighten it if no heat rash appears.  If a heat rash appears, postpone tightening until the seventh day.  Apply softened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then tighten it.  The method of tightening is to apply the bandage to the fracture, then wrap a fresh cloth around the bandage. Then bring the arm to the upper arm, and place the hand open on the shoulder.
Hold the cloth and tightening to the upper arm and forearm so that the arm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you from doing so and there is no change in the fractured bone. If you fear a change in the bone, use splints.
This means that you should place a splint on the fracture itself, one that is wider and stronger than the other splints.  Keep a finger's width between each splint. The length of the splints should be according to the fracture, with an additional three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tightening described in the first section.
This means your tightening should be stronger on the site of the fracture.
And the further from the fracture, the less the tightening should be. If you see the placement of the splints and tightening as we described during the setting of the limb, do as we say.
If you fear a hot swelling, leave the tightening and splints until the seventh day, as we said. Then check the ligaments every three days, so that irritation, puffiness, or the limb's inability to receive nourishment due to excessive tightening do not occur.  Correct all of that according to what we have mentioned.
If you are certain that none of this will happen, do not loosen the ligaments until many days later.  The patient should lie on their back, with their hand on their abdomen.  A padded, moderate-sized arm sling filled with wool should be placed under the elbow.
Examine the broken limb at all times, day and night, to ensure its shape does not shift or the ligaments relax. Correct all of this with your effort, and make the patient's diet as we previously stated, to be gentle at first, until the bone strengthens.
Then, the diet should be thickened.  It is the custom of the arm and leg to strengthen in forty days.  At that time, the ligaments should be loosened, and the patient should use baths and be treated with ointments appropriate for that, if the fracture is severe or comminuted.
Do not loosen the ligaments for fifty days, or even up to two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called radii.  One is small, and is the one next to the thumb, and the other is large, and is situated beneath the small one, at the bottom.  Sometimes only the larger radius is fractured, sometimes only the smaller one, and sometimes both are fractured.
If the upper small radius is fractured, its setting is easy and its healing is quicker. If the lower radius is fractured, the fracture is bad and its healing is difficult. The worst case is when both bones are fractured. If the fractured bone is the upper small radius...
Therefore, the physician should, when setting it, apply a gentle, moderate traction until it is aligned. If the large radius is fractured, the traction should be stronger; if both radii are fractured, the traction should be very strong.
When setting and pulling the hand, it should be placed extended on a cushion. The thumb of the hand should be positioned higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers. The patient should be seated upright.
The cushion should be at the same height as him, so that the patient does not have to strain.
Then, one attendant supports the arm from below, either with their hand or with a bandage, and another attendant supports it from above.  Then, the physician aligns the bone to the best possible form. If the fracture has splinters, they are reduced.
Reduce each fragment to its proper place. If a detached splinter is found that pierces the skin and you are unable to set it, incise over it and remove it, as described earlier. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate section addresses this.
Treat this accordingly from that section.  If a hot swelling appears during the initial setting, apply a bandage soaked in rose oil and white wax ointment, which should be of medium thickness.  Apply the bandage gently, until the swelling subsides.
Remove the bandage and apply a dressing prepared from mill dust and egg white. Then, apply the splints. The splint directly on the fracture should be wider and stronger.  Know that the arm usually requires six splints.
The fracture may be in one ulna or in both ulnae.  Then, make the tension over the fracture site stronger and firmer.  As you adjust the tension upwards or downwards, gradually loosen the tension, as previously described in the beginning of the chapter.
Use soft, damp bandages to wrap the fracture, avoiding overly stiff ones.  The thread used for tightening should be linen, of a medium thickness as described previously.  Check the limb and ligaments after several days.
If a problem arises, such as irritation appearing on the limb, the limb should be bathed in warm water until the irritation subsides. Leave the limb unconstrained overnight for rest, then resume the tension.
If the tension has become too loose and the bone has shifted or similar, correct everything to the best of your ability. Also, if the limb is not receiving adequate nourishment due to excessive tension, slightly loosen the tension and leave it for several days so nourishment can reach the limb, then re-tighten.
If none of the previously mentioned problems occur, the splint should not be removed until approximately twenty days have passed.  Then, suspend the patient's arm from their neck, keeping the arm straight.  The patient should avoid strenuous movements and sleep on their back.
Know that this arm fracture may heal within thirty days, or thirty-two, or perhaps even twenty-eight days.  This all depends on the individual's constitution and strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of fractured hand and fingers.
The metacarpals of the hand and the finger bones rarely fracture, but rather often suffer contusions.  Therefore, if a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand...
The patient should sit with their legs crossed, and a chair should be placed in front of them.
Then, the patient places their hand outstretched on the chair. Then the attendant extends the fractured bones and the physician straightens them, until they are properly aligned.  Then, a bandage and splint should be applied, unless a hot swelling has developed.  Then, a splint should be placed over the affected area.
And it should be enclosed in a soft cloth. If the fracture is toward the palm of the hand, make a ball shape from cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with their injured hand. Then, fasten it with a long cloth.
Let the splint be made of soft leather, so that the skin can heal while the entire hand is bent.  Secure it as needed. If the fracture is outward, then a splint should be placed over and another splint under the hand to maintain the open and upright position of the hand.
Then, the splint is secured, wrapping around the hand and tying the fingers together with a bandage. If a fracture is present in any of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be aligned correctly and secured with the hand. Or, if desired, a small, separate splint can be applied to maintain the alignment of the fracture.
Do not move. If the fracture is in other fingers, like the middle, index, ring or little finger, they should be aligned and secured to the adjacent healthy finger, or all of them tied together with a bandage, this is better, or a small, separate splint placed on them.
As we said for the thumb, and carefully examine the injured area during and after the reduction of the swelling and inflammation.  Address any further issues as they arise, as described.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the reduction of a fractured thigh.
The thighbone often fractures and is readily apparent due to its shifting forward and backward.  Reduction is accomplished by applying a bandage above the fracture and another below, with the patient lying on their face.
Then each attendant pulls the bandage in their direction, maintaining a level position if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  However, if the fracture is near the hip, a soft bandage, either of wool or similar material, should be applied.
At the hip, towards the pubic area, the pull should be upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture; likewise, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee, to pull downwards. Then the physician should straighten the bone with both hands until it is restored to its natural shape.
The bone will heal well.  Then, the bandage and traction should be maintained, unless the limb develops a hot swelling. If such swelling occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then resume the treatment.
As for the traction, a wide, firm bandage should be wrapped around the fracture two or three times, leaving excess material.  Then, the leg should be wrapped so that the heel is at the top of the thigh. A long thread should be inserted between the thigh and the leg near the lower part of the knee, with the ends of the thread extending upward from both sides.
Then, wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.  Next, apply splints to the thigh, at the site of the fracture itself, and create a single splint for the shin bone.  Then, fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft cloths to ensure even traction.
Then begin with strong traction from the middle of the fracture site, wrapping three or four times.  As the bandage moves further from the fracture site, the traction should become less forceful, gentler, and looser.
Then, take the ends of the thread you inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie them to the adjacent splints above. Then, bring the thread ends down to the ankle, and use them to tie the ends of the splints on the other side as well.
So that the bandage does not shift from its place.  Then leave the traction in place as long as no sores, swelling, or inflammation develop in the limb. If any of these occur, promptly loosen the bandage and correct any issues as previously described.
If there is a sharp fragment of bone protruding, it should be smoothed if possible. Otherwise, it should be cut and removed, and the wound treated in the same manner as previously described, until healed.  Sometimes, this fracture of the thigh can be treated without the addition of splints to the leg.
As we mentioned regarding the arm and forearm,  treating it this way does not cause the patient to limp, but if you treat it alone without including the leg, the patient will always limp.
Know that the thigh is immobilized for fifty days, or slightly more or less, depending on variations in temperament and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On fractures of the kneecap.
The kneecap is rarely fractured, but often bruised. If a fracture does occur, it is either a crack or a fragmentation of its parts, and this may or may not be accompanied by a wound.
All of this is assessed by touch. The fracture is treated by bringing together the separated fragments with the fingers, to the degree that is possible through gentle and careful alignment, then applying a bandage, and a circular splint, if needed.
Further supporting bandages are applied to match the alignment, and all conditions described for other fractures, such as inflammation and similar issues, must be treated according to their requirements until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the treatment of a fractured leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the radius.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the arm bones. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is the same.  If both bones are fractured, the leg turns in all directions. If the thinner bone is fractured, the leg turns forward.  If the thicker bone is fractured from below, this is evident to you.
Therefore, use extension and realignment, and bind the splints accordingly, whether the fracture is of one or both bones. However, if the fracture of the leg is severe with many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and exert care in its treatment.
In treating the leg, there is something more to be done than with the arm.  After aligning the splints and completing all your work, take two pieces of pine wood, used for smoothing rooms (or similar materials, such as palm fronds).
Choose pieces that are somewhat thick, not thin, and have a length equal to the leg, from the knee down.  Then wrap two layers of cloth around each piece lengthwise. Place one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let them extend from the knee to the foot.  Then tie the two pieces in three places: at the ends and the middle.  With this arrangement, the leg will not tilt left or right, and will be well supported.  A wooden gutter along the leg may also be used.
Place it (the wooden gutter) to prevent movement, and this is especially important with a fracture that has an associated wound.  Then examine the leg each day, carefully observing for swelling, puffiness, or any other abnormality. If any of this occurs, treat it accordingly until healing.  The leg bone will heal within thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the fracture of the bones of the leg and fingers.
The heel bone is not susceptible to fracture.  The bones of the leg may be fractured, and the fingers are rarely fractured, but are more often bruised.
If a fracture of the leg bones occurs, and you see the bones overlapping, have the patient stand on the ground with their foot upright as if walking, then place your foot on the protruding bones and press them down and level them.
Until they return to their proper positions, then take the bandage and splint, place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot, and tightly bind the foot with the cloth and whatever else you need.
After three or four days, release the bandage, and you will find the bones leveled, whether they were fractured or dislocated.  The procedure is as described.  If some fingers are fractured, manipulate and level them as described for the fingers of the hand.
Then, make a splint for the fractured finger, along the finger's length and slightly wider than it.  Place the board you described under the foot and secure it tightly.  If two, three, or more bones are fractured.
Make a splint for each finger, sized appropriately and placed within soft cloth. Secure the board to the bottom of the foot, ensuring each end of the board extends beyond the sole of the foot for a good fit.
You should not forget to treat all the fractures with the symptoms we have described, addressing each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
Fractures of the female pubic bone and the male penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, place her in a squatting position, then gently lean her back slightly, supporting her from behind.  Then the midwife should pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and round like a ball.
Then, the woman is moved, and her pelvis is raised slightly, little by little.  The cotton will then come out until it is like a ball at the opening of the vulva, and the fractured bone will return to its place.  Then, a pad is placed on her back.  When she wants to urinate, the cotton is gently removed so that she can urinate.
Then, it is returned to its original position, and the initial pad is replaced.  This is done for seven days or so, and the fracture will be mended.  If desired, a sheep's bladder may be taken, a tube of reed placed on its opening, and the entire bladder inserted into the vulva.
Then, blow forcefully into the tube so that the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will return to its place. Then pack it with cotton and keep it as described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this method is used for its repair.
Its treatment is the same as described for the hip bone.  The correct approach to these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, is evident to you, especially if you have some experience and understand my book, for the fracture itself often gives you clues.
Follow the correct method in setting and tightening it.  As for the penis, if it is fractured, take the neck of a goose and insert the penis into it.  Then place a bandage of cloth over it, and bind it up. Leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On setting fractures of bones when accompanied by a wound.
For someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large like the femur or humerus, or similar, one should immediately perform bloodletting if the conditions for bloodletting, as previously explained, permit.
If the wound is bleeding, one should quickly cauterize it with powdered alum, if nothing else is available.  Then, set the fracture that very same day, and do not delay.
If no inflammatory swelling occurs, then if inflammatory swelling does occur, postpone setting the fracture until the ninth day, until the inflammatory swelling subsides.  Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for it will expose the patient to bad symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin, exposed, you should gently try to reduce and align it with your hands and a slight extension.  If you are unable to reduce and align it with your hands, reduce it with this instrument, which is made of iron, seven or eight fingers long. And its width should be proportionate to the wound.
Therefore, the physician should make three or four of them, as needed for treatment of each type of fracture, and let them be round, slightly thick, so as not to bend when struck during use.
And let them be sharp-ended, with a bend at one end, and thicker at the top, gradually tapering to the bottom, very thin.  This is its depiction/illustration:.
It is called, in Greek, "permos," meaning a small lever.  The sharp, curved end should be placed on the protruding end of the bone, and it should be pushed once.  Then, if the bone is returned and is somewhat aligned, the ends of the fracture should be aligned with one another.
If the fractured end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then the end of that bone should be cut so that the instrument can hold it. If it is not possible to return the bone as described, then cut it with a similar cut to the ones we mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, as you can, then remove any remaining roughness and thin scales from the bone.  If, after returning the bone, the patient feels severe, harmful pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient.  Once the bone is completely set, dip a cloth in a dark, astringent liquid, especially if it is summer. Do not place a bandage or anything oily on the wound.
So that there is no putrefaction or decay, then use splints when you have finished setting the bone. Leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the dressings, with scissors, according to the size of the wound.
Beware, above all, of tightening the wound with the fracture; often, ignorant physicians do this, causing their patients either death, or eating away, or a cold.  Let your tightening be soft and relaxed, unlike the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or large, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and if he experiences distressing pain at the location, you should not apply splints.  Make dressings from strong cloths in the place of the splints and bandage with them.
If, after a day or two, you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth you placed on it with the liquid, and then use the dressings and ointments that we use to treat wounds, like the Four-Element ointment and the like.  You should also loosen the bandage.
Examine the wound every day, morning and evening, until it heals and is cured.  The limb should be positioned so that the pus drains easily downward.  If the wound takes many days to heal, and the pus does not stop, know that there are small fragments of bone.
You should probe the wound with a probe.  Remove and extract any fragments that are loose.  If any fragments are not loose, and are irritating the limb and causing pain, then cut them and remove them by any means possible.
If the wound develops a cold, or an ulcer, or another form of decay or putrefaction, you should treat each symptom with a similar treatment as described in the relevant section.
If a large, prominent bone such as the femur or humerus, or similar large bones, is fractured, you should not attempt to pull or remove it. Often, death results from such attempts. Leave it alone until it becomes infected, perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place to treat it; otherwise, leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty.
On treating the complications that arise after some fractures.
This complication often arises after the fracture has healed, especially if it is near the joints. It spoils the appearance of the limb and may prevent the limb from its normal function.
If the complication is fresh, use astringent medications such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, henna, acacia, and similar ones, taking some or all of them and mixing them with a contracting liquid, or egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the complication with difficulty, and bind it firmly. Leave the binding undisturbed for many days, then loosen it and repeat the process until the complication disappears, God willing, or bind a firm lead plate over it.
Lead possesses a property that removes all that accumulates in the limbs. If the complication has hardened and become severe, and necessity dictates its removal, cut through it from above and remove the protruding excess or remove it with some instruments until it disappears. Treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treating a fracture, if the limb is subsequently thin and unlike its original form after being set.
If a fractured bone is set, and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this is due to many reasons. One reason is either due to the excessive loosening and binding of ligaments improperly, or due to excessive tightening of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, or due to excessive and inappropriate poulticing, or due to excessive and inappropriate movements, or due to a lack of blood and weakness in the patient's body.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich their body so that blood increases in them, and to use baths, bring joy and happiness to them, and the like.  Then, apply asphalt to the limb to draw nourishment to it, or continue poulticing with lukewarm water. Until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of broken bones that are rejoined crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
When a limb that has been set after healing shows crookedness or a bulge in the broken bone, or a complication, and the appearance of the limb is thus marred. However, if the limb is not hindered from its natural function, it is not proper to accept the claim of those who claim to break the limb from the head, and many ignorant physicians and bone setters in our country used to do this.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to great danger, and the least of its consequences is injury. But if the crookedness and complication are recent, it is necessary to apply water in which relaxing herbs such as mallow leaves, roots, and kings crown and the like have been boiled.
And apply relaxing dressings, such as well-made diachylon, or take the sap of the mallow root and mix it with chicken fat and sheared butter, and apply it as a dressing, or take ripe figs, grind them with pigeon dung, and similar remedies that are called resolving the inflammation.
And the complication may be resolved by constant gentle massage with the hands, and the limb is moved in every direction at all times. If the crookedness is old, severe, and hardened, and necessity dictates treatment with iron.
Then it is necessary to cut above it, release the connection of the bone, and cut off any excess complication or bone with the finest instruments, using care and gentleness in this process, and then treat the wound with what was previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is a dislocation of a joint from its place, hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing the patient intense pain and suffering.  Therefore, when a person experiences a dislocated jaw, one should promptly attempt to reposition it.
Do not delay at all.  If delayed, the area will swell and become a tumor, making repositioning the jaw difficult.  Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor moved nor stretched while it is swollen, because the patient will often experience spasms and painful ailments.
However, if this occurs, one should first bleed the patient, then wait until the swelling subsides somewhat, then apply warm water and ointment to the affected area.  Then gently reposition it, and treat each limb as described in its appropriate section.
The chapters on the jaw are also arranged, as was done with fractures, from the top of the body downwards.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
The jaws rarely dislocate, and their displacement occurs in one of two ways: either they shift slightly from their positions, becoming somewhat relaxed; or they completely dislocate, becoming completely relaxed. To the chest, causing the patient's saliva to flow uncontrollably, unable to retain it, or to close his jaw, and his tongue to stammer while speaking. If the dislocation is slight, it will often return to its place quite easily.
However, if the dislocation is complete, one must quickly return it and not delay at all.  A servant should hold the patient's head, while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
Or, if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, both thumbs are inserted; the other fingers of the hand are positioned on the outside to align it.  The patient is instructed to relax and open his jaw wide in all directions, while the physician aligns and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult to return, especially if both jaws are dislocated, apply a hot water and medicated compress until their return is easier.  Do not delay their repositioning, as we stated before.  Once they have returned and the patient's mouth is closed and not relaxed, place bandages on them with a concoction made from wax, oil, and rose.
Then, tie gently with a loose bandage. The patient should sleep on their back, with their head propped up between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right or left, nor attempt to chew anything.  Their food should be soft and easily swallowed.
Once the pain subsides and the jaw is healed, let the patient eat whatever they desire.  However, they should be gentle and avoid forcing their mouth open for eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is completely healed.
If the jaws, once dislocated, do not return to their proper places, difficulty in returning them often leads to fevers, constant headaches, and possibly abdominal discomfort or repeated vomiting. If you see this, know that it is a serious complication.
Often, death occurs within ten days of this condition.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In repositioning the collarbone and shoulder joint.
The collarbone does not dislocate inward due to its connection to the chest.  It may dislocate outward, which can be felt.  To reduce it, the patient should lie on their back with their arms extended.
Then press the area firmly with your hand; it will return to place.  Afterwards, apply a bandage and splints, and secure them.  As for the part of the collarbone that connects to the shoulder, it rarely dislocates.  If it does, it should be repositioned and straightened as described above, to the extent possible.
Then apply a bandage, splints, and dressings, and instruct the patient to remain still and quiet until healed.  By this same treatment, the shoulder joint can be repositioned if it too is displaced.
Chapter Twenty-six.
Concerning the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder joint dislocates in three ways: one, it dislocates downward towards the armpit; two, it dislocates towards the chest; and three, it may dislocate upward, away from the shoulder, although this is rare.
It does not dislocate behind the shoulder or in front of the nerve.  It dislocates most often downward towards the armpit, especially in those with little muscle, as it quickly exits and quickly re-enters.
However, in those with substantial muscle, it is different; it exits with difficulty and re-enters with difficulty.  Sometimes, a person experiences an injury or fall, and the shoulder swells with a hot inflammation.  One might suspect dislocation, but it is necessary to investigate thoroughly to ascertain the situation's accuracy.
Then, in treatment, if the dislocated shoulder is downward toward the armpit, by comparing the dislocated shoulder to the healthy one, a noticeable difference is found.  The head of the dislocated shoulder is twisted, and beneath the armpit, upon palpation, the head of the shoulder feels like an egg.
The patient cannot raise their arm to their ear or perform any other movements. Similarly, if it dislocates toward the chest or upward, the difference is apparent upon touch and not hidden.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  To reduce it, have an attendant raise the arm upward. Then, place the thumbs of your hands under the patient's armpit and lift the joint forcefully upward into its proper place while the attendant raises and extends the arm upward.
Then lower it downward; it will return quickly. If it does not return as described, and the dislocation has lasted for many days, the patient should bathe in warm water and apply poultices that relax and soften, such as boiling the root of the hyacinth, fenugreek, and crown flower in water and using it.
Then the patient lies on their back, and a ball of wool of moderate firmness is placed under their armpit.  The physician places his heel on the ball and holds the patient's hand, extending it downwards.
Push the ball with your foot, and it will return to its place.  Alternatively, to achieve reduction, have a man taller than the patient stand on the side, placing his shoulder under the patient's armpit and lifting the armpit upward so the patient is suspended in the air. Another attendant pulls the patient's hand down toward their abdomen. If the patient is light, something else should be attached to weigh them down, as this will return the dislocation immediately.  The dislocation may also be reduced in another way.
Another method involves placing a long, round-headed piece of wood, like a mortar pestle (not too thick, not too thin), under the patient's armpit.  A soft cloth is placed on the head of the wood.  The patient stands along the length of the wood.
Then the patient extends their hand downward on the other side, and also extends their body forcefully on the other side.  The joint will quickly return to its place. If reduction is difficult with all the previously mentioned methods, use this treatment: take a piece of wood about two arms lengths long. Its width should be about four fingers, and its thickness about two fingers.  It should have a rounded head, to easily enter the armpit in this way.
Then a soft cloth is tied to the rounded head to prevent the wood from hurting the patient.  It is placed under the armpit, and the entire hand and arm are extended along the wood downwards. The wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and wrist.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbar, the bar being placed across.  The hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging on the other side. The joint will then enter its place. Once it is in place in any way possible, a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared dressing, made of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white, is applied over the entire shoulder, circling upward.  Then a firm bandage is applied under the armpit, and the dressing is wrapped with bandages over it, upward. The arm is suspended from the neck.
The hand should not be moved for seven days. The patient's food should be limited so that the limb strengthens, which will speed healing. Then, after seven or five days, the bandage is removed and the patient is encouraged to move the limb. If it remains stable and does not relax, then healing has occurred.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture or another cause, cauterization with the three types of cauterizing agents, as previously described in the chapter on cauterization, should be used. If all of this is done, and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint still does not hold,
If the bandage and its tightening are repeated multiple times, but the joint still does not hold and drops, relaxing, and the arm cannot be raised upward, know that the nerve in the shoulder joint's head is severed, stretched, or relaxed.  In that case, know that the joint will never hold in place.
Regarding the dislocated jaw, which is situated near the chest and breast, and is displaced backward, it should be repositioned by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to its place.  Use all other bandaging and treatment until it heals. If, after healing, there is tenderness in the area and slow movement,
The patient should use a bath frequently until the tenderness subsides and returns to its original state.
The twenty-seventh chapter.
On the treatment of a dislocated elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty.  It dislocates in all directions, particularly forward or backward. Its dislocation is not hidden from you, since it is under observation and can be felt, regardless of the manner in which it has dislocated.
When the dislocated elbow is compared to the healthy one, its dislocation becomes apparent through the concave nature of the joint.  The arm cannot be bent, nor can the shoulder be placed against it.  One must act promptly to relocate the dislocation before a hot swelling arises.
If a hot swelling arises, its relocation becomes difficult, and it may never heal, especially if the dislocation is backward. This is the worst type of dislocation, the most painful, and often results in death.
To relocate it, if it is possible to return, a servant should extend both arms and hands with the arm outstretched.  The physician's hands should be positioned above and below the elbow, pushing the joint back into place using the thumbs of both hands or the base of the palms.
If the dislocation is forward, the arm can be bent one time so that the palm strikes the shoulder, which is aligned with it.  If the dislocation does not return, apply a very strong and forceful extension by having two servants extend the arm.
Two servants should also hold the patient to prevent movement during the extension. Then the arm is rotated in all directions after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around it. If the physician is working on the joint with their hands, they should apply ointment to the area to facilitate easy dislocation of the joint.
Then the joint is forcefully pushed back into place. After its return, a bandage containing compression, drying agents, and egg white should be firmly applied. The arm should be suspended from the patient's neck and left in place for several days.
Then it is untied. If the joint is firmly positioned and the ligament has been released, leave it alone. If you see that the joint is not firm, reapply the bandage and the splint, and leave it in place for several days until it becomes firm.  Then, untie it. If it produces pain after the joint's return and release,
If movement is difficult, use warm baths, gentle massage, and manipulation until it becomes flexible, or place a thick, soft cushion on the joint, then bind it, and leave it in place for a day and a night. Then remove it and place the patient in a warm bath. Once he sweats, massage the joint gently.
Then repeat the application of the cushion one, two, and three times while in the bath until it becomes flexible.  If you prefer, apply damp, finely ground cow dung mixed with ghee, and bind it on. Repeat this several times; this will soften the joint and restore it to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints, but it is important to quickly reduce it as soon as it dislocates, before inflammation or a hot swelling develops in the area.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board, and have an attendant extend the arm. The physician should place their hand on the prominence of the joint and push until it returns; however, it is necessary to examine whether the dislocation has moved to the underside of the hand.
If the dislocation is outward, the patient should place the outside of their hand on the board during the extension and reduction.  If the dislocation is outward, have the patient place the inside of their hand on the board so the physician's hand is over the same prominence of the joint.  If it returns immediately, then do so; otherwise, apply a bandage to compress the swelling.
Leave it alone and don't try again, as it cannot be borne and you cannot reduce it after days have passed, except that the joint will remain deformed and will not harm the patient except that the hand will be weakened and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve is severed or bruised, and there is no remedy but to tie it up. Perhaps this will help, and perhaps it will not. After the wrist is successfully reduced, apply the bandage we described, then tighten it and leave it on for five days.
Then it is removed, and the hand is exercised.  If movement is difficult and some stiffness is present, soften it with heated water and massage repeatedly until it becomes flexible.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction.  If a finger dislocates towards the palm's surface or its underside, extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumb until it returns to its place. Then bandage the fingertip and support it towards the direction to which it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and stretch it until it is straight and upright that day. If it is nighttime, bandage it in the same manner.  Continue to unbandage it during the day and exercise its movement, and bandage it at night.  Do this for several days until it strengthens.
And do the same if it dislocates towards the underside of the hand, bandaging it towards that same direction.  Do your initial procedure until it heals.  Do the same if it dislocates in other directions.
Chapter Thirty.
In treating the dislocation of the spine.
When a dislocation occurs in the vertebrae of the back or neck, a complete dislocation, or if many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death swiftly approaches the afflicted.
And a sign of this is that the afflicted's stool is expelled involuntarily; he cannot retain it. Often, some of his limbs, either his legs, or his arms, or one of them, become relaxed.  If one vertebra is displaced from its position, it often shifts.
And its displacement can occur in four directions. The one that shifts backward is called a hump.  As for its treatment, one should examine it.  If the hump occurred from childhood, there is no treatment or cure for it at all.  However, if it occurred from a fall, a blow, or the like...
The ancients described various treatments with lengthy explanations, much of which proved ineffective.  I have condensed this, making a little of what I have said sufficient for much of what they presented. I have clarified the meaning and explained it, and I have depicted the instrument differently from how they described and explained it.
I say that a hump that forms in the front of the chest has no cure, nor is there any recovery from it; likewise, those that occur to the sides.  Only the one that occurs in the back is treatable, specifically as I describe it: the patient should be laid on their face.
On a flat platform near a wall, and spread underneath a moist mat so as not to injure his chest. Then, a vertical plank, driven into a hole in the ground, is placed near his head, at one end of the platform, and another plank near his feet at the opposite end of the platform.
A servant holds one plank, which is not secured in the hole, and another servant holds the other in that manner.  Then, a soft, secure bandage is wrapped around the patient's chest and under his armpits.  A portion of the bandage is extended to the plank near the head and tied to it.
Then, another bandage is tightened over his hips, over his knees, and at his ankles.  Then, all the bandages are gathered and tied to the other plank near his feet.  Then, each servant pulls the plank toward their side with the bandage, and the planks remain in their fixed positions.
However, they are not secured, as we said. The physician places his hands firmly on the protrusion until it returns, or he places a plank on it, then rests his legs on the plank until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, a plank measuring about three cubits is taken.
A space is dug in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, where the end of the plank can be inserted.  The middle of the plank is placed on the lump, and the physician places his legs on the other end, pulling firmly to compress the protrusion.
And it returns to its place.  If you wish, you can achieve this with a hand-twisted coil, by driving two planks into the ground, a cubit in length, near the patient's head at the end of the shop, and two more at his feet at the end of the shop.
Let there be a span between each plank.  A hole has been made in each plank through which the coil runs.  All the planks are firmly secured in the ground so that they do not move at all.  A round piece of wood, which is the coil, is inserted into the holes of the two planks, where the bandage is wound.
At its end is a hole secured with a stick one span long, to which it is wound.  The same is done in the other two planks.  Then, the bandage fastened to the patient's chest is tightened on the coil near the head, and the bandages fastened to the legs are tightened on the coil near the feet.
Then, a servant stands at each coil, twisting the coil with the twisting implement. The physician adjusts the lump as previously described.  This is an illustration of the coil, the shop, and the patient.
Then, after the fracture returns and the area is aligned, the dried bandage should be applied, then the plaster.  Then, a splint of wood, three fingers or so in width, and the length of the bump, is placed over the bandage.
And on top of some healthy beads. Then it is tied with the necessary bandage.  The patient should eat soft food until healed. If some protuberance remains in the area after healing, then medicines that soften and relax should be used, along with the splint we described for a long time.
A lead plate may also be used.  A protuberance may appear at the end of the vertebrae, leading to the mistaken belief that a dislocation has occurred.  This might be an extra bone that has protruded, and should not be treated in this way, as death could occur.
Chapter Thirty-one.
In the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and are not subject to the slight displacement and subluxation that occurs in other joints.  The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
This is because it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward.  It dislocates inward most often, and rarely forward or backward.  A sign of an inward dislocation is that if you place the patient's healthy leg alongside the affected one, the affected leg will appear longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will be unable to bend the leg at the groin. The area next to the groin will be swollen and clearly swollen, indicating that the head of the thigh has moved there.
The signs of a dislocation outward are the opposite of these signs.  The sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient can straighten the leg completely, but cannot bend it without pain, and if they try to walk, they cannot do so forward.
The patient's urine will be retained, and their groin will be swollen. When walking, they will place their weight on their heels.  The sign of a backward dislocation is that the patient cannot straighten the knee, nor can they bend it before bending the groin, and the leg will also be shorter than the other.
The groin is relaxed, and the head of the thigh is clearly visible at the hip area.  As for the reduction of these dislocations, observe if the dislocation is old and has been with the patient for some time, and they have not attempted to reduce it, and remains in its condition, then there is no cure at all.
Therefore, it should not be presented to you.  As for the recent dislocation, of whatever type of the four types of dislocations, immediately twist the joint, extending it inward and outward, and move it to the right and left, perhaps...
If it returns without needing further treatment, then if it does not return in this manner, it is necessary to have a strong, capable assistant to stretch the leg from below, either with their hands or with a bandage tied to the leg above the knee, and another assistant to stretch it from above.
By inserting their hands under his armpits, then pulling with a soft bandage on the root of the thigh, and a third assistant holding the end of the bandage, and the stretching can be done either from the front, from the groin area towards the collarbone, or from behind towards the back.
All of them should stretch at once, until the patient rises with his body off the ground and remains suspended.  This type of stretching is common to all four types. If the dislocation returns as we have described, then otherwise each type requires its own specific treatment as mentioned.
As for its specific return if the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on their sound side, then a bandage should be placed on the root of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the area below the groin.
Then the bandage is stretched upward, from the groin area towards the upper body and collarbone.  Another strong assistant grasps the thick part of the affected thigh with both arms and stretches it outward forcefully, and this will return it to its place.
This type is easier than other types of treatment for returning this limb. If you cannot achieve it with this method of treatment, you must tie the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage around the ankles and knees.
Each one should be a distance of four fingers from the other.  The affected leg should be stretched out further than the other, by a distance of two fingers.  Then the patient is suspended from the head by a wooden beam inside the house, and it should be a distance of two arms from the ground.
Then command a strong servant to grasp the head of the thigh, and another servant grasps the patient and pushes the servant holding the thigh forcefully. The joint will return to its place quickly.  As for its specific return if the dislocation is outward.
The patient should lie on the bench, as described for the humpback patient.  The bandage should be tightened on the affected leg and chest.  Then two pieces of wood are placed, one at the patient's feet, the other at their head.  A further piece of wood is placed firmly in the middle of the bench.
Wet cloths should be wrapped around it so that it does not injure the patient, so that the board is between the patient's thighs to prevent him from being pulled downwards during stretching. Then each attendant should pull in their direction and the physician should adjust the hip with his hands. If it returns to its place.
Otherwise, place the board on him and press it as described for the humpback, except that the patient should lie on their healthy side. If the dislocation is forward, the patient's leg should be stretched once, in this exact manner, on the bench.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with the other hand.  At the same time, the pressure should be extended downwards towards the knee.  If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be stretched downwards.
He is elevated off the ground, but should be placed on something firm.  Also, the hip and thigh should be turned outwards, as described in his lying position on the bench, face down, with bandages tightened.
As we stated previously, the board should also be used to apply pressure to the area where the joint has dislocated. When the hip joint returns properly – and you will know it has returned because the patient's legs can be stretched –
If you see that they are level and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned correctly.  Then, join the thighs, apply the dressing, and secure it with a bandage so tightly that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain at rest for three or four days.  Then, loosen the bandages and dressing, and compare the legs.  If you find that they are the same size, know that the fracture has healed. Release the patient to walk. If you notice any weakness,
Return and re-dress and tighten it as you did initially. Leave him at rest for three more days, then allow him to walk slowly for a few days until the limb is strong, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On the treatment of the knee fracture.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (i.e., backward).  It never dislocates forward. A sign of its dislocation is to instruct the patient to draw their leg towards their thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. To treat all forms of dislocation, have the patient sit down with their legs extended, if they can manage it.  A helper should sit behind the patient to hold the patient's middle and gently rotate their body backward slightly, then you should sit on the patient's thighs.
You should face the patient, place the patient's leg between your legs, and then grasp the knee with both hands, interlacing your fingers on the knee.  Then, firmly press the sides of the knee with your hands, while another assistant extends the leg, until the knee returns to its place.
A sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh gently without force. Then bandage it, fastening the leg to the thigh, and bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, then remove the bandage.  Only allow the patient limited walking for a few days until it strengthens.
If you are unable to return it using the method described, then use strong traction with the bandages I previously described for treating the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may dislocate slightly or completely.  Dislocation may occur either inward or outward.  A sign of dislocation is that the heel appears swollen and prominent toward the direction of the dislocation.
As for treating a slight dislocation, it is easily returned by gently pulling and aligning it until it is back in place.  But if it is completely dislocated, the patient should sit, and a strong, sturdy assistant should hold him from behind, in the middle of his back.
Then, with your right hand grasp his foot from above, and with your left hand from below, at the ankle.  Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand, twice.  Then straighten the foot with your left hand and push the front of the foot towards the leg with your right hand, without force.
Do this twice as described.  Then, on the third time, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling the heel.  If it returns in one or two attempts, and you see the foot is aligned, then stop.  Otherwise, repeat the procedure; it will return.
If it will not return with the method we described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground, and firmly embed and secure a very strong stake in the ground, positioning it between his thighs.  A cloth should have been wrapped around it to prevent injury to the patient.  Then the assistant should hold the patient's thigh.
Then another assistant stretches the leg, either with their hands or with a bandage tied around the patient's neck.  Then each assistant stretches in the opposite direction of the other, with the stake firmly between the patient's thighs to keep his body from pulling downward during the stretching.  Then the physician straightens the joint with their hands.
And another assistant holds the healthy leg below.  Then the joint will return quickly.  If the joint returns and you are sure of its return, take the bandage and splint and secure it with tight bindings, and tie the foot to the bandage below.  Care must be taken to avoid the nerve that is behind and above the heel.
So that the binding is not too tight and causes pain.  Then leave it for two or three days.  If the bandage loosens, tighten it, and then release it on the third or fourth day.  The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, there is a risk that the joint will dislocate and be ruined, and treatment will not be successful afterwards. If a hot swelling appears, the remedies described previously for other conditions in the treatment and poultice sections should be used to alleviate it until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of the joint of the toes.
One should gently straighten the dislocated part by a slight pulling motion without force; this is not difficult but easy. If the dislocation is in one of the toes on the top of the foot, the patient should place their foot on a flat surface.
or on a board while standing as if walking, then place your foot on the protruding joint, and press down firmly with your foot until it returns to its normal position and the protruding area disappears.
Then place a board under the sole of their foot, covering the entire foot and having two ends.  Bind it firmly for three days, then unbind it and keep them from walking for many days, until it strengthens and a relapse is avoided, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation which occur with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both.
When anything of that sort occurs, and you attempt treatment and reduction, it is frequently followed by death.
Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless one is skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, compassionate, meticulous, not rash or reckless.  In the beginning, one should use only medications to relieve inflamed swellings, and allow the patient to recover.
Except by God's grace, unless you hope for the patient's safe recovery from injury, despite the mildness of the illness, and you perceive some hope for it, then at once, in the beginning, before a severe inflammation occurs, return it.
If the limb returns to its proper place, as you intended, then use the treatment that relieves inflammation and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments. If the dislocated joint is accompanied by a fracture, and fragments of bone have become detached, then remove them. Follow in that regard what we have mentioned concerning simple illnesses in the preceding sections.
Strive diligently and purify yourself from entering the realm of uncertainty, as I have previously instructed you.  That will preserve your reputation and safeguard your standing, God willing.
