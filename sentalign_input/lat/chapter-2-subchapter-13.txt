On the treatment of Alxatrati, which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental, then, results from the healing of a wound, or a cut, or cautery, and similar things.
And the procedure for it is to split that healed area, separate its edges, and place between them a small strip of linen, and bind it until it heals.
And it is not necessary to use drying and constricting substances in its treatment: for if you do so, the Alxatrati will return worse than it was: rather, use softening agents, such as fenugreek: and bathe with water in which althea and flaxseed have been cooked: and dyaquilon ointment, melted with some oil: and wrap with linen, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is to strive by every skill to ensure it does not heal in the form it was at first.
And indeed, this procedure we have described is only a kind of correction of Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return exactly as it was.
