O dearest sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its fulfillment, and have made its end through its expositions and its declarations.
And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say "surgery."
And because the work of hands is withdrawn in our region and is completely foreign, thus the science is perished and cut off, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that hands have changed.
And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are closed and science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will come with the forms of iron cautery tools, and other instruments of the work with the addition of its declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And because no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distant.
And it behooves one who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so much that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of bones and nerves and arms and their number, and the movement and of moving veins and resting ones, and of the place of their exit.
And therefore Hippocrates says that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; especially in the art of hands.
We tell you at the beginning of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the aforementioned things should beware lest he fall into error and kill people; thus I have seen many times several of those who undertake this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut an abscess of scrofula in a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; wherefore so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who extracted a stone from a man of age, and the stone was large; thus he took with it a piece of the bladder, and the man was dead within 3 days.
And I had already been called there to extract it, and saw the disposition of the patient and the size of the stone, and knew well that if one cut him he would die.
And I saw another physician who took into care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break had a wound; and the physician full of ignorance bound the break over the wound with splints by strong binding, and did not leave any opening for the wound, and left it thus for a time; and commanded him not to unbind it; and remained thus until the leg was all swollen and the foot and came to perdition.
I was called to come to him, and hastened to come unbind the leg; and when I had unbound it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But nevertheless the corruption was already confirmed in the member, and I could not heal it; and the corruption did not cease to go through the member until the member was completely lost.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and then inflamed it through the malice of his lordship.
For cancer, when it is pure of melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron if it is not in such a place that one can completely remove what is corrupted.
And therefore, dearest sons, it is necessary for you to know that work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is peril in several dispositions; and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and peril.
Therefore it is necessary that you take care, so that foolish doctors cannot speak ill of you. Take your instruments with concern, and treat your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that by God's grace you achieve success and are praised; and leave aside frightening diseases of difficult healing; and keep your instruments away from what makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: "Do not take on treatment of a bad disease, lest you be called a foolish doctor."
I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is about cauterization by fire and cauterization by strong medicine, and the chapter is ordered from head to feet; and about the forms of instruments, and cauterizing tools, and everything that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and cupping glasses and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and similar things; and the chapter is ordered and includes the forms of instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things; and is ordered from head to feet, and about the forms of instruments.
Before we recall the work, it is necessary that I speak about the quality of help and harm for each complexion.
I say that the quality of help and harm is the longest discourse and subtle science and hidden secrets; and many of the wise spoke of this, and agreed on this; and their words suffice me little, for I fear lengthiness.
I say that cauterization helps universally for every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions: namely hot complexion without matter, and dry complexion without matter.
In hot and dry complexion together with matter, some made distinctions and said that cauterization is of great help; and others said the opposite: that cauterization is not valuable for illness that comes from heat and dryness.
For the nature of fire is hot, and hot illness should not be treated by heat, nor by dryness; and he who said the opposite claims that cauterization provides great help for hot and dry illness that comes in men's bodies.
For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement.
For I have found it sometimes through experiment.
And yet, let none undertake it except those who have tested it, and who know through long usage the chapter on cauterizations, and the diversity of men's complexions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the span of time; of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses.
And all doctors assembled and agreed on cauterization.
And know, son, that cauterization with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cauterization with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and only reaches the member that is cooked, and hardly harms other members.
Burning medicines travel from member to member at a distance, and bring to the member illnesses of difficult healing; and by chance kill the patient. Fire, because of its nobility and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experiment and through the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and stood upon the truth of things; and therefore I excuse myself from the length of discourse, for it does not please me that I should hide from you the secret that is hidden in fire, and the quality of the work, how it drives away illnesses from bodies, as the philosopher says in demonstration; now receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on what time cauterizations should be made, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the arising harm is subdued by the help of cautery; and especially if cautery is necessary for severe and urgent pains that cannot wait for fear that greater harm might come to the limb.
And never think, dear son, as do foolish physicians; for an illness that is healed by cautery does not return; and they say it thus; but it is not as they believe, because cautery is nothing but a medicine that changes the constitution, and dries the humors that are the cause of pain, and works better than medicine due to the swiftness of its value, and due to the virtue of its work and its authority.
And it is possible that the illness sometimes comes according to the constitution of the patient and the location of the illness and its strength; and superfluities are gathered in it through the acquisition of foods and similar things, unless cautery is administered in a place where there are few superfluities and moisture, such as dental cautery for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and this is true; but they do not believe that cautery works after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer types of cures for some illness and they do not work, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Thus it appears clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish physicians.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the nobility of its substance; and they said that the cauterized area does not produce rot, but this is not true for I have tested it, and have found that this is true in some men; and gold cautery works better than iron, as they said.
And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you cannot tell when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly; and if one heats it too much, it melts in the fire; and thus there are many impediments.
And therefore we use iron cautery because we have it better prepared for our work.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to foot, so that the path might be easier to find.
On the olive-shaped cautery
This cautery is effective for moisture and cold in the brain, and there are two that are done because of an illness called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for multiple dreams and tooth pain and throat pain, and especially for all illnesses that come from cold such as paralysis and deafness and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The procedure for this cautery is that the patient should be purged by purgative medicine cleansing the head for 3 or 4 nights, according to what the strength and age and constitution of the patient can bear; and then have the patient's head shaved.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and put his hands on his chest; after put the base of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle finger falls, mark it with ink then heat the cautery which is called "olivare," of which here is the form:
And put it on the spot marked with ink, and proceed downward while tightening your hand little by little while turning; then lift your hand quickly, and look at the spot to see if you can see the bone a little bit; and if you don't see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you; after take a little salt, and put it in water and wet cotton in it, and put it on the spot, and leave it for 3 days; after put cotton soaked in butter on it; and leave it until the burn is removed; after treat the wound with the ointment that is called "tetrapharmacon," until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it purges; and therefore it helps better.
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery until part of the bone is burned, and then scrape what is burned from the bone, and it should be treated.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on, and push so hard that one removes from the bone something as wide as a whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors exit better; and one should leave the wound open for a long time; afterward one should treat it and close it.
And these two methods of cautery don't seem to me to be completely good, except in some men where there is cause for fear; and it seems better to me that I should leave it; because the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other members; and especially when the patient's head is weak by nature, and the first appearance of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it then together with safety.
On ancient head pain
When chronic pain comes to the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use iris and pills that are called "cochie," and purging of the head and oils and plasters; and if one does the cautery that we mentioned before, and it doesn't work.
Take note if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it isn't too cold; then cauterize below that cautery a little that we mentioned above.
After make a cautery on each corner of the head down to the bone, as we said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "vessels"; and it is a place where one puts cupping glasses; and lighten your hand so that you don't go down to the bone: the patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere; and it is necessary that the cauteries of the corners be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
About cauterization of the head
When sudden pain comes to a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head has been purged by cleansing medicines, and one has done the other treatments that I mentioned in the section on illnesses, and all this does not help: then make cauterizations according to two methods, that is to say with caustic medicine and with iron.
The cauterization with caustic medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and remove the skin and cut it a little at both ends, and then split the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can hide the clove of garlic under the skin; and when it is hidden, bind it and tighten it well and leave it thus for 12 hours; and then unbind it and pull out the clove of garlic, and leave the wound thus for 2 or 3 days; then put on cotton soaked in butter until pus comes out.
Afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Heat the cautery of which here is the form:
And it is called "nail" because the head is made in the form of a nail where there is a bit of curve, and in the middle has a small protrusion; and put it on the painful place, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the skin is burned; and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and abundant blood flows.
Afterwards put cotton in salt water, and put it on the place for 3 days; then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the place with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery which is called "knife-like," with all the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
About migraine
When you treat migraine as we have said before in the section on illnesses, and it does not help, and you see that the aforementioned cautery of medicine and iron is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery which is called "knife-like" until it is white; and first mark on the painful place a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and tighten it so you do not cut the artery and that you do not come to the bone; and beware of the mandible that moves when one eats, and the nerve that moves it and that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of blood flow from the artery when it will be cut, or cutting has great fear and especially to one who does not know it, and who is not studied and experienced; and leave the work halfway; but I will tell you how to stanch blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed; and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
About ear pain from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and one has worked with dissolving medicines and the other treatments that we have mentioned in the section, and the pain does not move, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which here is the form:
Afterwards make points all around the sick ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and keep a little distance from the root of the ear after you have marked the place with ink; and have 10 points around each ear; afterwards treat the place until it is healed.
of the distortion of the mouth
Distortion that must be treated by cautery is only of those that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the division of diseases; and do not apply cautery to conditions that come from dryness and spasm of nerves.
When you treat this type of distortion that comes from phlegm of hydras and purgations of the head and gargling, and this does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with 3 cauteries: one at the root of the ear, another a little outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips; and put the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery right at the head of the ear above a bit below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the core is burned; and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is the appearance of the knife-like instrument that we have shown before, but it is a bit more subtle and the blade should be a bit thicker; afterwards treat the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient has no fever, then make 4 cauteries: 2 on the two horns of the head, and 1 in the middle of the head, and 1 in the place called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and let it be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness one must give the patient large pills purifying the brain; afterwards shave the patient's head completely, and put on the occiput the mustard plaster that is written in the treatise on plasters; and this is the manner of the cautery: do it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, good; and if he is not, make him 3 cauteries from the middle of the head descending to the neck, and have a space between each cautery of 1 finger's width; and treat it like the others, and if you want to add more, and the patient can bear it, make him 1 cautery in the middle; and if necessary, 2 others on the two horns, and treat until healed; and let the cautery be what is called "olive-shaped", as I have said before.
of the coldness of the head
It is necessary that the head be purified with pills and with what we have said before; afterwards shave the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each horn, and 1 behind and 3 on the spine of the neck; and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient can bear it, and the illness is strong, make him 4 cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until most of the core is burned, and lift your hand; afterwards treat until healed, and let the cautery be what is called "olive-shaped" that we have mentioned before.
of epilepsy
The epileptic should not use cautery except for that which is phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to purify the brain with pills and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is grown and able to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot bear it, make him gargle and chew things purifying the brain often with good foods; afterwards shave his head in the middle, and make 1 cautery according to what we have said before, and 1 cautery on the vessel, and on each horn; and if the patient is strong and can bear it, make him cauteries as I have said to the one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner I have said.
If the patient is a child, make him 1 subtle cautery according to this manner:
When due to melancholy the superfluities or humors are corrupted and phlegm is thick, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for those who have paralysis.
And if due to melancholy the superfluities are declining to melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain shall be purified, according to what was stated before in the division.
After shave the patient's head; after make a well-made ring of linen, like a circle, and place it in the middle of the head; and have the patient sit cross-legged, and be well held from all sides; after apply the liniment, and aged sheep's butter works better; and heat it on fire moderately, so that fingers if inserted can bear it; after empty the circle from within the middle of the head, and let it cool; and do this to the patient once every week with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize him by making several points with all the cautery.
This manner of cautery moistens the brain equally; and then put cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat on top.
On water in the eyes
When water first comes to the eyes by the signs that I have described in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that purifies the head, and guard him from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath several times while fasting.
After command him to shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries above the two temples if the descent of water is in both eyes together, or in one if the descent is in one; and cut with all the cautery all the veins and arteries that are below the skin, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple; and guard yourself from blood flow, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stanch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution how you will stanch it; and sometimes one makes cautery in the nape below the two back bones.
On the flow of tears
When the tears of the eyes are old and habitual and are above the veins, or beside the arteries that are in the outer appearance of the head; and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make the cautery that I have mentioned at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries in the nape below the two bones; and if there is need for more, then cauterize wisely above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
On the flow of tears inside the eyes
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not profit at all, then give to drink to the patient for three nights at bedtime; after shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle with the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery that is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair; and guard yourself from cutting the artery.
And this is the form of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery that is called "olivare."
Of which here is the form:
And if you wish then make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are; and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have described.
about the hair that pricks the eye
Sometimes it happens that the eyelashes turn inward and prick the eye, and one applies cautery in two ways: namely by fire, or by burning medicine.
For cautery by fire, command the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even; and if they prick at their root, hold their eyes so they don't move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your lap; afterward mark on the eyelid a shape that is like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be beside the hairs; then put cotton soaked in egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery which has this form:
After, cauterize over the shape that you have marked little by little many times, so that the flesh is burned there; and the sign of the success of the procedure is that you see the eyelid retracted, and the hairs raised from pricking the eye; then lift your hand, and leave it thus for 3 days, then put cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed; afterward treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after this the hairs come back, and the eyelid is softened then begin the cautery again on that same place, just as you did at first; and if the hairs are outside, cauterize until the eyelid is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery with burning medicine is that you command the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf; then take French soap and quicklime, one dram of each, and grind together well; and do it hastily, so it doesn't cool, then spread it over the shape that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid; and if the malady affects only one eye, one should work on one, and if on both likewise; and put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your lap and put your index finger on the medicine, and press a little and move it every time the patient feels burning from the medicine, for they feel burning as if from fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger.
And when the burning has passed, wash the place with water, and look if you see the eyelid raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is good.
If not, put more of the medicine on the place where the medicine hasn't worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are set right; then put on cotton soaked in butter until the burned flesh has fallen off, afterward treat the place with the ointment that is called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you guard well your work with great care that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the eyelid becomes soft afterward, and the hairs prick the eye, begin the medicine again on that place of the eyelid that has softened, just as you did before; afterward treat it until it is healed; and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that men's eyes are different in size and smallness, and according to this should be your constraints; and let not the right way be hidden from him who studies this art.
On the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat fistula as we have described in the division of diseases, and your treatments are not effective, then it is necessary that you perform cautery in this manner.
Command the patient to put his head in your lap; and have the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he cannot move or shake his head; then put cotton soaked in egg white or in parsley juice over the eye; then heat the cautery which is like this: and is fitted at the end like the shape of a bird's feather, together with which is the cautery; if you wish, it can be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it can be like a tent [surgical dressing]; but nevertheless, the one that is fitted is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and draw out the matter; then apply the very hot cautery, and hold your hand on the cautery on the side of the nerve away from the eye, so that your hand does not make a mistake; and put the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If you reach the bone at the beginning of the cauterization, that would be good.
If not, then repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for 3 days; afterward put cotton soaked in butter on it, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if 40 days pass without it being healed, then apply sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what will come in its chapter.
And there is a type of cautery for fistula that some of the ancients described.
Pay attention to the fistula, and split the area; then put in the split a fine rod of which this is the shape:
and they make it to the quantity of a dram of lead; and hold your hand firmly on the rod, and the patient must not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run into his eye; and it is necessary to put on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg whites or in water: the lead burns the site of the fistula, and heals it with marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good.
If not, then it is necessary to make a hole at the nerve, and bring the fistula to the body of the nerve according to what is required in its proper place.
On cracks in the lips
Very often cracks occur in lips that are called "hair," and especially in children's lips.
When you treat these cracks with what we have described in divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife-like cautery of this shape:
And put it quickly in these cracks until it reaches the bottom; afterward treat the area with wax until it is healed.
On abscess of the mouth
When an abscess comes in the root of the mouth or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then makes pus and breaks and becomes old and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have described in divisions, and it is not effective: then it is necessary that you have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; then push it into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its bottom and final place; and do this once or twice, then treat it with what we have described in treatments, until it is healed; and if it is cured thus, that is good; and if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
On loose teeth
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat it with medicines and this does not work, then put the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose shape will come hereafter in such a way that you put a reed on the tooth; and put inside it the hot cautery quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat coming to the root of the tooth; then lift your hand and repeat the cautery according to your judgment; afterward have the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and spit it out.
And in this way the tooth that was loose is strengthened, and the softened gum tightened, and the corrupted moisture dried.
On tooth pain
When tooth pain comes from cold, or there is cold or truly, and medical cures are ineffective, then there is need for cautery in two ways: butter cautery and fire cautery.
Butter cautery is such that you take cow's butter, and boil it in an iron or brass spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a probe, and soak it in boiled butter, and put it on the aching tooth quickly and hold until it cools; and do this often until its power reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the heat reaches the end of the tooth.
The fire cautery is such that you take an iron or brass tube, and let it be thick so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth; then heat the cautery, whose form will come hereafter, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools; do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill their mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cautery:
And make the cautery from whichever end you wish, and according to what you are able; and this is the form of the tube:
On scrofula
When scrofulas are from phlegm and cold moistures, and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, then heat the hollow cautery whose form comes hereafter, and let it have two openings for the fumes to exit the cautery on the other side; and put the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess; and if the abscess is small then apply cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and put cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed; afterwards treat the place with ointments and probes until it is healed.
The form of the tube:
When moistures overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from cold complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be first emptied by purgative medicines; afterwards make a cautery at the root of the throat, and take care that you do not come up to the throat, and burn the flesh only a little.
Afterwards make another cautery at the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let it be the cautery which is called "clavicle" whose form we have before; and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
On cough
When cough and lung disease are from cold moistures, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the disease is old, make two cauteries on the hollow of the chest in empty places; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let it be the cautery which is called "clavicle" according to the form which is said before.
And if you wish, make puncture cautery with the cautery which is called "points" whose form is given before in the disease of the ears; and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
Afterwards treat the place according to what is said before, and let the cautery have three prongs according to this form:
And for this the cauteries are easier, because you make three at once.
On the dislocation of the humerus (de la dislocation de l'ajutoire)
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and one puts it back in place, and it cannot stay but rather keeps coming out with small movements that occur, as we have observed, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation.
Afterwards, let the patient lie on his back and on his side; then lift the flesh that is within the armpit with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inward, heat the cautery that has 2 prongs, of which here is the form:
and cauterize the flesh until it pierces through to the side, and the pattern of the cautery will come together as 4 cauteries; and for this reason the cautery is made with the cautery that has 3 prongs, so that the pattern of cauterization makes six cauteries; and the prongs are according to the thinness of a probe and this is the form of the cautery that has 3 prongs:
And sometimes one prong is added to this so that there are 8 cauteries.
Afterwards, put crushed leeks with salt on the cautery; then let the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which happens rarely, then make a cautery on the thickness with the nail-shaped cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed again, and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
When coldness and much moisture come to the stomach so much that they draw it to their condition, and catarrhs multiply in it, and in the customary ways of treatment it does not benefit, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
After this, make him 3 cauteries: 1 below the breast bone by the measure of one finger, with the nail-shaped cautery, and 2 cauteries outside the two sides so that the pattern of the cauteries forms a triangle, and let there be such space between one and the other that they are not joined together when they will discharge pus; and let the cauteries be so deep that they take up two parts of the flesh, and let the pattern of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and for one who will be afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you wish in ink; then cauterize it with the cautery that is called "points."
Afterwards, treat it with the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When pain comes to the liver from cold and moisture and thick windiness, so much that it is put out of its natural condition by the superfluities; and the patient is treated for what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his nape; and mark in ink 3 cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, there where the elbow of the man comes; and let there be space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be along the length of the body, and do not press your hand too much with the cautery; and let only half of the flesh be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet; and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms; and this is the form:
And if it is your wish, then cauterize these cauteries with the knife-shaped one, if you are subtle and wise in the art, and take care that you do not burn all the flesh, for you would make the whole body dry up; and that it does not come up to the bowel, for the flesh is very thin there, and know this for truth.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you want to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain that is not too strong; and if it is in the membrane, they feel mad pain.
And when this cure defeats the physicians, it is necessary that the patient lie on their back; and then mark with ink the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery that resembles a ray, of which here is the form:
And cauterize with a cautery until the skin is burned, and reach until the peritoneum, until all the pus is out; afterwards treat according to the treatment of discharges until it is healed; and none should use this cautery except those who have studied for a long time in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these diseases have sometimes run.
Thus he can work boldly, and nevertheless it seems to me that it is better to leave it.
On the cautery for pleurisy
The ancients said that one should make cauteries for pleurisy from roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: take a root of long aristolochia, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and be as thick and as long as your finger; and moisten it in oil, and light it with fire, and cauterize one cautery between the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries descending a bit in the part that is below the beard; and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, declining a bit behind; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another on the stomach, and one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the chest outside the cautery that is between the shoulders; and do not press your hand, but do it openly as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use an iron cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and put it between the ribs, until it comes to this abscess; and the pain jumps out, as we have said in the liver abscess.
But in this work there is fear where the patient dies immediately, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
On the spleen
When you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have said in the divisions of cures, and it does not profit, then three types of cautery are appropriate which are all good.
Of which one manner is that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line according to the length of the spleen, according to the figure of the liver cautery that we mentioned before; and do not press your hand with all the cautery, and let the patient be lying on their back; and another manner of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two branches, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder; and lift the skin that is right on the spleen, where the patient's elbow comes toward the left, and let the elevation with which you lift the skin be according to the skin, according to the length of the body, and let the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards push in the two inflamed branches until the skin is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four. And if you want, cauterize with the cautery with three branches.
Afterwards treat it when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other cures mentioned before.
On dropsy
Cautery is not useful for dropsy, except for the type that is called "ascites."
When you treat it according to the ways that we have said in divisions, and your treatment does not profit, then it is necessary that you make four cauteries around the navel, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back on the spine, and one opposite the chest; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the skin.
Afterwards leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not abandon the treatment of the patient after the cautery; and healing will hasten, and the two intentions will be together with God's help.
The form of the cautery for the belly should be the nail that we have shown before; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is put here before.
on the swelling of feet
When the feet are swollen in one who has dropsy, and are full of yellow water, it is necessary that you cauterize on the top of the foot between the little toe and the ring toe; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, thus the yellow water will flow out, and let the cautery be according to this form:
Afterwards make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg at the point of the knife; and let the cautery be lengthwise, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg; and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treating, so that the water comes out; afterwards treat it with the other treatments that we have mentioned.
on diarrhea
When looseness of the belly comes from cold and moisture, such that the retentive and digestive virtue which is in the stomach and in the intestine is weakened, and cannot be cured by manner of treatments; and you see the patient well-bearing and of strong virtue, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been spoken of before in the cautery of the stomach, with the circular cautery; and four cauteries around the navel subtle with a subtle nail-like cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient bearing it, then make a cautery on the groin, and a cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach beside the large one, for the treatment is profitable when there is good help.
on the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, either one or several, and are old and are of thick cold and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in divisions, and it does not profit, then make cauteries: three on the spine of the back, that which is all outside below almecdate little by little in triangulating, and one cautery below the navel two fingers; and if you think that his stomach is cooled, and the food does not digest, and one sees the face swelling, then make him a large cautery on the stomach, as it is said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the nail-like cautery; and leave the cautery open for a long time.
Afterwards treat the place until it is healed.
on the fleshiness which is called "thelul"
When you cut althelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then put it all glowing on this cut althelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery comes to the birth of the vein, from which the blood flows; do this once or twice, and if there is much althelul, then cauterize each as we have said; afterwards treat them with profitable ointments until they are healed; and if you cauterize with a large cautery on alchatim, there will be greater help.
on poorly healed wound
When the patient cannot suffer cutting or opening, which we will recount in its place, such illness comes that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When someone gets a fistula, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupted moisture, you should probe it with a subtle probe, and take care that you know with the probe how deep it is.
Afterwards heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and push it into the fistula according to the quantity that the probe entered, and restart the cautery until these rotten and corrupted bodies are burnt, once, or twice or thrice, according to the quantity of its need; and guard yourself from burning the nerves which are there, and the great veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and to the intestine, then guard yourself from these places, and do not do this except in fleshy places, and think that it is not piercing; afterwards treat the place until it is healed, and if the place is sealed, and the matters are removed for a long time, then know that the place is healed entirely; and if the matters are not removed, know that the place is pierced, and the bone is corrupted at the bottom; and thus as one of these that we will speak of in its place.
on kidney disease
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from thick windiness, and one loses desire for women, then it is necessary that you make a cautery on the kidneys on both sides with the nail-shaped cautery that we mentioned before; and if we cauterize in the middle, there will be 3 cauteries in a line, and they will provide greater help.
on the bladder
When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, such that the patient retains urine, then make a cautery on the outer part above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as a thumb's knuckle; and make one cautery on the outside of the back, or two if you need them; and let the cautery be nail-shaped according to the form described before.
on the womb
When the womb is cold and moist, and this prevents conception, and the menses are corrupted and their timing delayed; and when they come, there is great pain: then it is necessary to make 3 cauteries around the navel, as we said for the bladder cautery, and 2 cauteries on the outside of the back; and let the cautery be nail-shaped, as we have said.
on the hip
When viscous moisture descends to the hip socket, and because of this it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together; and the place of separation is found empty, it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the hip socket with a cautery resembling a circle, and mark beforehand the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is within the circle; and let the cautery be like the one used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, make 3 large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cautery be as deep as all the leather; and treat it until it is healed.
on hip pain
When pain comes to the hip socket, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division and the treatment does not work, and the illness is old: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of thick humors with fetid pills, or other good similar pills.
Afterwards make a cautery; and the manner of cautery is according to two ways: that is to say together with burning medicines, and cautery of fire.
Cautery of fire is according to many ways, of which one is such: that you cauterize above the hip socket with 3 triangular cauteries according to this form, and make good and great depth, and let there be between each cautery a space of a finger's width, and let the cautery be olive-shaped; sometimes one makes a cautery in the middle above the head of the hip, which makes 4 according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we mentioned before for hip dislocation; but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the thickness of the leather is burned.
And this is the manner done in sciatica, when the pain holds in the hip, and does not reach to the thigh or to the leg.
And if it comes to the thigh and leg, make 2 cauteries where the patient says the pain holds, and 1 cautery above the ankle 4 fingers' width, on the left side a little; and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and let the thickness of the leather be burned; and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or near there, cauterize where he feels the pain with 3 or 4 points with the cautery that is called "points."
And if needed, make more of them; and if he knows that the pain is below the knee toward the thigh, make a cautery with the knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take good care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and the large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it until the leg was all swollen, and the foot as well, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted.
After a solution of the belly from which he had death.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make cautery in one and the other, according to this manner.
And the wise men said about the cautery of the hip, of which here is the manner: make such an iron and let it be at the head as thick as a date stone, or a little less, and let it be with cross-pieces and from one cross-piece to the other let there be the space of a thumb joint; and let the cross-pieces be open on two sides, and be like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle; and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then let it be put on the socket of the sick hip, and let it be turned to the healthy side; and cauterize it once with a round cautery and leave it three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; after treat with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use this cautery little because of the fear of its appearance, and we see few who use it; and yet this is one of the good cauteries, for those who can bear it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with cross-pieces in which descends the margin of the opening, and let it be of brass or iron with a long wall, and in the height let there be two knots, and let there be between each the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and let them be open outside and above, and join together according to this form:
After put it on the hip socket of the patient lying on their healthy side, and press your hand much on the hip socket; after pour between the two circles hot water which should be heated at the fire a little, and leave it for an hour of time, and let the patient suffer the heat and burning of it.
For he finds biting there as if from fire; and when the biting has passed, lift your hand with the instrument and wash the hip with sweet water, and leave it thus three days, and put butter on it until what is black from the scalding is removed; and leave it three days that pus will come out; and this will be the last aid after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make him an instrument that holds water according to what you have done for the hip equally; and this is the manner of hot water, and I have written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine.
Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot.
Where there should be a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter; and put over this pot another well-leaded pot, and put on alkali and lime and sweet water above, so much that there is a finger above the powders when you will have well pressed it with your hand; and leave it thus until sharp water descends and falls in the leaded pot, then take all this water, and pour it on lime and on alkali as before.
And then it will be very sharp and is administered in many medical works and in cauteries of other members. For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well such as teazel and anacardium honey and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of the pain of the hip and of the sciatic vein, and praises it much, and says that no other cure was made there, and that he was healed in a single time when this cure had been done, and he had bathed as he teaches here after.
And he says in such manner that you take fresh green litharge and dry it, and grind it much with a little grease, and put it on the hip and on the thigh and on the leg where the pain holds, and bind it; and leave it three hours and for the quantity that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make them enter the bath until their body is a little wet, and make them go to bed, and the pain will go away completely and they will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery of such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps much; and the cautery should be done in this manner.
Take wool and soak it in old oil, and put it on the small hollow that is between the thumb of the foot and the other that is called the ankle bone.
After take dry goat dung, and set it on fire until it becomes charcoal, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished; and do this again, and do not cease doing this until you think by reason that it reaches to the hip, and that the pain has ceased; and this manner of cautery is called "goat cautery."
Of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, either by falling or from a blow or by too great evacuation, or by signs of cold matter spread, none of these symptoms warrant cautery, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is emptied of fetid pills or other similar things, that one makes on their back, there where the pain holds, three lines marked with ink, and in each line 5 cauteries or more according to the strength and quantity that the patient can suffer; and let the cautery be made according to the cautery that is called "points"; and if you wish, make 3 or 4 cauteries with the medium nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of its beginning is that they have short breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in knots the appearance that comes on the other spines.
When you see this and you want to cure it, cauterize it with the circle cautery according to this form.
So that the cautery encompasses each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery 2 or 3 lines, and let the points be close to one another.
After treat the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful not to administer cautery on a hump that is in nerve spasm.
Of the pain of the joints
When joint pains are from moistures that are spread to each member of the body, and when pain comes to feet, which doctors call "podagra" properly, and when it is from cold cause and cures of medicines cannot cure it, it is cured by cauteries in this manner: make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if there is need that you point on the face of the foot, make cautery with all the cautery that is called "point."
And if the pains come up to knees and to other joints, and this happens many times, make cautery on each knee 3 or 4 cauteries on each part, with the olive-shaped cautery; and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there except until the thickness of the leather is burned.
And if the pains descend to knee and to back, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist in 2 lines; and if any pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the palm of the hand; and if the pains come up to the elbows or up to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good governance to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give them good governance and you purge phlegm, they will be healed with God's help.
On the rupture of the abdomen
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend to the testicles and this is recent, it is necessary that when you want to cure it, he should not eat that day; and he should use things that loosen the belly, so that the waste descends from his belly; after, make him sit on his back between your hands, and command him to hold his breath until the bowels have returned, and guide them back with your fingers, and mark with ink below the rupture on the pubic bone, and make a sign that resembles half a circle above the body; then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
until it is white and throws sparks.
Then return the bowels to their place; and the assistant should keep his hand on them so they don't return backward; and spread well the thighs of the patient, and put under him a cushion and an assistant on the thighs, and another on the chest who holds his hands; then put the cautery on the mark with your hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you don't reach it the first time, start again another time until you come to the bone; and guard carefully that the bowels don't protrude when you use the cautery; that you don't burn them; and that through this the patient doesn't die, or other evils.
And know that when you don't reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be subtle according to their measure, and for grown people also large according to their measure; after 3 days treat the cauterized place with butter until the burn is removed; after treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and the patient should lie 40 days on his back until the wound is well sealed; and it is necessary that his nourishment be laxative for a long time, so that the bowels don't protrude when he tries to go to the chambers.
And after 40 days, when he wants to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and wear it another 40 days; and have good rest, that he works little and guards against too much repletion from drinking and eating, and from shouting too loud; and when he follows this instruction he is healed entirely.
And I will tell hereafter the cure of cutting in its chapter.
On the rupture of the belly
When ruptures come in other bellies and are known, and you want that they don't grow more, make him a cautery with the round cautery according to its quantity, and let a third of the core be burned; after treat it according to what we have said; and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize with the three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place with ink and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and guide your hand in the middle with the nail-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
On ancient pain in any member
When pain comes in any member, either from falling or from striking, and this pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is not effective, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points," and let the cautery be according to the length of the member and its smallness and its weakness and its strength and its location of twists and its pain.
if he is healed from the first cautery, that is good; if not, begin another cautery above that one, for such is the custom that it should move to the member that is nearby, for which reason it is necessary that you make the cauteries until the patient is healed.
On leprosy
Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cauterization, especially the disease that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you want to cauterize it, observe if the disease is at the beginning, and if it has been treated as we have said in the division, and does not descend nor remain, and you fear that the corruption might overtake the whole patient, then make 5 cauterizations on the head: 1 in the middle of the head at the crown, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and 2 on the two corners, and 1 behind on the nape; and leave your hand there until the cauterization reaches the bone, and until the crusts come out so that the vapors of thick humors can escape; and cauterize on the spleen as mentioned before.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere and is manifestly visible, it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauterizations that we mentioned on the head, and 1 cauterization on the tip of the nose, and 2 cauterizations on the spine of the neck, and 6 cauterizations on the spine of the back, and 1 large one on the croup and another beside it, and 2 on the two shoulders; and 2 on the elbows, and 2 on the cartilages of the chest, and 1 on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands; and beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, that you do not burn them; and sometimes one makes a cauterization on the wrist bone, and another on the breastbone, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauterizations you make, the more help you provide, and the better it benefits; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cauterization as healthy people do, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And the cauterizations must be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the types of irons.
Afterward, treat the area with vetch flour with honey and other treatments until it is healed.
When swelling comes in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauterizations on the limb according to the size and smallness of the limb; and let the cauterization be slightly entering into the thickness of the skin; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes one makes cauterization on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the swelling is removed; and nevertheless no one should undertake this if they are not knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
on vitiligo
When the disease that is called "albaras" is old, and the devices of medicine are worth nothing, then cauterize it with a cauterization slightly deep, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed; then treat it with vetch flour and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and be bound with a cloth, and be attached to the place until it is healed.
the treatment of cancer by cauterization
When cancer comes at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the cancer.
And nevertheless the wise said that one should make cauterization also in the middle of the cancer; and nevertheless this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it might become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen it happen sometimes; and it is more right that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular", as we have said in many cauterizations.
of the swelling that cannot mature
When someone has a disease that is called "adubelati", and it is slow to mature either because of the superfluity it makes or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say very old) and he has little blood, or because of the weather; and you want to hasten its maturation: then cauterize around it with many small cauterizations by pricking; afterward leave it thus.
For it will hasten to mature.
"And if you want to pierce it with the cautery, then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
And put your hand in the middle of this illness which is called 'adubelati' until the cautery has pierced the heart, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it from outside in such a way that the flow of pus is relieved.
After that, treat it until it is completely healed.
The treatment of fire by iron
There is another kind of illness which is called 'corrodens', and it is nothing other than an itching of the limb, for it eats away at the limbs just as fire does dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can endure cautery with fire, then heat the small and large nail-shaped cauteries, according to what is suitable for the place where the illness is; then cauterize it from all sides until you remove all the corruption, and nothing remains of it, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
After that, treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, that is good; and if not, then restart the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places.
And this itching has sometimes been cured with sharp medicine instead of cautery by fire; but nevertheless cautery by fire is of greater help, and I have already spoken of the treatment with sharp medicine in the division: take it when you need it.
About warts that come to the feet
Very often it happens that on the feet externally grows an illness which is called 'clos' according to our understanding, and it is a thick felted thing that hurts the foot.
And the cautery for this illness is of two types.
That is to say cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is when you heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's feather, and it should be made of good iron to the measure that it can encompass the nail from all sides, and that it has subtle edges; then put it hot on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus; then make a plaster of wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the plaster on all night, and the nail will fall and will be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the place with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are converted to the outside of the body, and many times it happens both on hands and feet, then it is necessary that you administer cautery of hot water; and it is in this way: take a tube of brass or iron, or a vulture's feather, and put it on the nail and the althelul, that is to say warts; and put the tube on so that it encompasses all around, then put a little hot water in it, and hold your hand steady, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the tube comes to the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root; and let the patient endure a bit the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will uproot itself completely with all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you remove all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
The treatment of trembling
When someone trembles from coldness of nerves, or from quartan fever or another, it is necessary that you make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the chest, and one on the stomach with the olive-shaped cautery; thus it will stop the trembling, and the healing of the cold illness will be hastened."
Of foul pustules
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from thick corrupted matter.
At first when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose point is lit by fire, or of long aristolochia root, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes one cauterizes them at the beginning when they appear, according to this method, and they cannot grow from then on, but the excess from which they come is broken down, and they are healed; but this must be done after blood evacuation.
When the artery is cut
Many times there occurs great bleeding from the artery which is cut in the wound that comes from the outside, or from the incision of the abscess, or from cauterizing the limb, and similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to stanch.
And whenever this happens to someone, hasten to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press hard until the blood is calmed beneath your finger, and no drop comes out anymore; then put several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire until they are all red; then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on the vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stanched.
And if it jumps out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery goes out, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this one after another until the blood is stanched; and be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient; and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot well stanch it, especially when the artery is large, except by one of the four methods that we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not drawn out, or by strong binding with thread, or by medicines placed on top that have the power to stanch blood; and it should be bound and tightened properly.
Whoever will administer staunching by tight binding with cloths or by putting burning things on top, or other similar things, it will profit little if at all.
And if this happens to someone and they have neither physician nor medicine present, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press well until it is stanched above the wound and above the vein; and do not remove the finger, but moisten it often with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened and stanched; and from then on do what is needed with cauteries and medicines.
Here begins the second book of surgical treatments
We have told you in the first chapter every illness in which cautery of fire is needed, or of burning medicine, and the occasions and the causes and the instruments and the forms of cauteries; and I have put that chapter from head to foot, and I will go in this chapter by the same way so that one finds more easily what one wants.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, dear son, that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first about cauteries, and therefore greater caution is needed.
For in the work of this chapter, many times there occurs evacuation of blood in opening the vein, and in the incision above abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in the incision above the stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness.
For many kinds of people come for treatments.
Thus come those who become so angry with their illness that they die easily because of the madness they find from their illness, and from the greatness of their malady; and of these one should be afraid.
And of these there are those who give you their sense, and say: "wait, I am cured"; and the illness is contemptuous.
"You should not agree with those who come to you with this manner, but place greater concern on your honor than on your greed, and do not work foolishly but wisely with that of which you are certain, and from which you can have reward and praise; and use prognosis and indication in cures of your patients for whom health should be restored; and this will help you acquire good renown, and glory, and memory of praise."
"Dearest son, May Our Lord give you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen."
"Now I have arranged this chapter by dividing it into chapters, according to what is before in the chapter on cauterizations, which I have detailed for you from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you will need."
"of the head full of water"
"Know that this illness comes very often to children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes too hard on the child's head; and sometimes this comes from a hidden cause that one does not know."
"And I never saw this illness except in children, and in all those that I have seen death hastened; and because of this it seems to me better to leave off working in such cures."
"And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger each day until he could not support it; and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered beneath the bone above the syphac, between the membrane and the bone; and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the membrane and the bone, and the swelling is small, you should make in the middle of the head a wide incision; and it should be as long as two knuckles, until the moisture runs out; and here is the form of the spatula:"
"If the moisture has increased more, and the swelling is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:"
"And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs that you see are the sutures of the head open on each part, and the water jumps out when you press it with your hand from within, and this is not hidden from you: it is necessary that you make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this manner:"
"And after the incision draw all the moisture out."
"Afterward bind the incisions with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil there, and leave thus until the fifth day; then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be bound evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed."
"And another manner of incision is that you look where the size of the swelling appears, and the gathering of water; for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left."
"Cut therefore there where the swelling appears, and the filling of water, and split it according to what you have the power to do; and be careful that you do not cut the artery; and blood flow comes, such that the patient dies from the running of blood and the evacuation of moisture."
About rheum (de reume):
"When someone gets a disease called 'catarrh' in the eyes or chest, and the illness is old, and medical treatment doesn't help, then the last treatment is cauterization along with cutting the two arteries."
"Therefore, when you want to cut them, the patient must shave his head; afterward rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient should tighten his neck with a cloth; then look where the vein pulses, and the locations of both are behind the ears, and they are slightly hidden; then mark the spots with ink, then cut both with a spatula sharp on both sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be done across the width of the head."
"And if you want, push the spatula under the artery and cut it above, cutting across about two fingers' width."
"And when the vein is cut, the blood jumps up continuously outward."
"And if the artery isn't apparent to touch, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut to the bone; and what needs to be let out of blood is 6 ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can bear, and the fullness of the artery; then examine the wound: if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it so that hot abscesses don't form there, then compress the wound and bind it, and treat with ointment until it is healed."
About migraine (de emigrainne):
"When old migraine comes, and acute catarrh, because of moisture from tears and heat in temples and old mad headache and similar things, and it is treated by various medical cures and none of this helps, we extract the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described."
"And the manner of extracting them is that the patient must shave the hair from his temples, and attend to the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is slightly hidden except in some men who are too cold; and if it is hidden, the patient should tighten his neck with some cloths, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and sprinkle the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which here is the form:"
"then carefully skin the hide until you reach the artery, then pull it up with pincers, and separate it well from the membranes that are below it on each side; and if the artery is thin, turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it from that part according to the size of the two ends."
"For if it isn't cut, the blood doesn't flow out completely."
"And draw blood from 6 ounces down to 3; and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double thread of silk, so that rot doesn't come before the healing of the wound, and blood flow occurs; then cut the excess that is between the two ties in that same hour, and then, if you want, cauterize it with the knife-like cautery to the bone until the ends are cut; and this is the best procedure, if the patient doesn't have fever and is of hot complexion."
"For the cautery helps to finish the moistures: therefore it is of greater help for moistures."
"When it is necessary for the extraction of arteries, one should fill the area with old cotton and place well-made tents on top; and when they are untied, treat it with dry medicines that promote flesh growth, and with tents, until it is healed; and if blood flows from the artery while you are working, hasten to cut it with a cautery, or fill the area with vitriol and press with your hand until the blood is stanched; and if you don't have this at hand, place your finger on the spot until the blood congeals, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the bleeding stops, and let it be constrained as needed; and what is better and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cutting cautery on both sides, but the cutting edges should be quite thick to retain their heat longer."
"For when the instrument is too thin, it retains less heat."
"And there should be one finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked with ink the two spots, and you place the hot iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and the two ends should be kept apart because it is not entirely sealed by this cautery; and this is the form of the cautery:"
"On tears
When tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are on the outside of the skull, and no medical treatment helps, and you see the patient's face becoming red, and they feel in the forehead a movement like ants; and their eyes are thin and moist so that the eyelash hairs have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and scraped by the burning of tears, then this treatment is needed."
"And the ancients called it 'contused treatment', and it is that you should have the patient who has this illness shave the hair they have on their forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead evenly along the length of the forehead; and one of the incisions should be like two fingers right in the middle of the forehead going down to the nose, and the other two on the two sides above the eyelids, and be careful of cutting the arteries that are on the two sides above the eyelids; and keep your hand away from the junction of the two mandibles, and each wound should be the width of three fingers placed together; and have ready a piece of sponge and many dry cloths to wipe away the blood, then insert the sharp spatula pointed on both sides of which this is the form:"
"from the incision that is toward the temple to the second incision; and scrape away all the skin that is between the two incisions along with the membrane that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then pull out this spatula."
"then insert into the first incision the instrument that is called 'cultellaire', and is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not cutting, and this is its form:"
"And place the cutting side toward the flesh attached to the skin, and the smooth side toward the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision."
"And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous up to what appears of the skin, and then do the same in the middle incision to the outer one; and then draw out the blood evenly, and press the area for the collected blood; then place in each incision a tent of old cotton, and place on top cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that no hot swelling develops; and on the third day undo the binding, and apply a large amount of lukewarm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and with other treatments used to treat wounds, until it is healed."
"On eye discharge/rheum"
When someone gets acute catarrh regularly, and you see the eyes thin and small, and vision weakening, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and deep in the head there is acute pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that these materials and this catarrh only come from many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And it is that you command the patient to shave their forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another one the width of a thumb.
And begin from the cut at the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the temple nerves that move during eating; and when the bone is exposed, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, and then separate between the two lips of the cut and put old cotton there, and linen tents; then bind above cloths moistened in wine and oil, and guard against hot swelling; when it is removed, you should rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying substances that make flesh generate.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to generate flesh throughout.
"On blockage of the ears"
Everything that falls in the ears is one of four things: either grains, or beasts, or mine stones or similar things like iron; or seeds, such as vetches, beans, peas; or flowing things such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone falls in the ear or another kind of thing that doesn't stick to the ear, nor grows in the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, drip a little violet oil or sesame oil, then administer extraction; and make them sneeze with condisi, and plug their nostrils when the sneeze comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and stretch the ear upward.
Many times it comes out through this cure; and if it doesn't come out, then administer extraction with subtle pincers, of which here is the form:
If it jumps out with the pincers, that's good; if not, then administer extraction with a subtle hook of small doubling; and if it doesn't jump out through this, then make a brass tube and push the head of the tube into the ear hole firmly, and plug what is around the tube with soft wax so that air cannot enter with the tube; then pull it out strongly, for many times it comes out as we have said; and if it doesn't come out in this way, then take glue with which birds are caught, and put it on the end of some instrument that is suitable for this purpose, and put a little cotton around it; then press the glue on the stone or whatever it may be, and pull out.
And if it doesn't jump out from all these things that we have said, then hasten to split the ear before hot swelling comes, and spasm; and the manner of the splitting is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to the measure of their strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn their ear upward, and make a small split in the root of the ear at the fat in the dependent place; and let the split be like a moon, until you come to the stone, then remove it according to your power, and suck it out hastily with your mouth; and treat until they are healed.
And if it is grains that are inside and they swell, then administer extraction; and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin subtle spatula according to this form:
and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think that the grains are moist from the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it; then extract it with subtle pincers and by sucking, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
In water therefore that falls in the ear, it is necessary that the patient first use sneezing with condisi, and fill the ear with old cotton.
And let them lie on the same ear where the water is.
If it jumps out by this means, that is good.
If not, then take several stones the length of your finger, thin and light, and heat them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of their ear, and jump on one of their feet on the other side, and strike another stone against the stone that is in the ear; and do not cease doing this from stone to stone until all the water comes out, and thus it all comes out; and if you wish, take a reed, and put one of the ends in the ear, and set the other end on fire until most of the reed is burnt; then do the same with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
For extracting a creature, if it is small in body, like a flea or similar thing, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is large enough that one can feel it, then administer extraction with pincers; and this is the easiest thing to remove from the ear.
For extracting worms bred in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and the treatment does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sunlight: if any worms appear, extract them with fine pincers, and if they don't appear, take the tube of which here is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above.
And put the thinner end in the ear according to what the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with the tube; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they refuse to come out, then plug around the tube with cotton as I said for the stone; and if they don't jump out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have proven effective in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations; and distill your oils and your medicines in the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see:
And let it be of silver or brass, narrow below with a small hole, and open above for distilling; and to press the distillation inside use a well-made brass instrument for this, and if you wish take a razor and wrap cotton suitably around the point; then pour your oil or your juice, and whatever you want of your medicines into the tube, and let the tube be in the ear; then push the razor with the cotton inside, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled to the depth of the ear; and let the patient feel it inside, and let the distillations be heated a little in the fire before they are distilled in the ear; and ensure it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as effective.
On blocked ears
Some children are born who have no hole in their ears; and this same thing happens to men through blockage from wounds, or from flesh grown inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes comes deep in the ear, so that one cannot see it; and sometimes it happens a little outside the hole, and one can see it well.
Therefore that which comes deep, so that one cannot see it, is difficult to heal in many conditions, and in that which one can see it is necessary that you put the patient's ear in the sunlight; and look inside: if you see the blockage apparent, then open it with this spatula of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and flat behind, so that it does not hurt the ear; if the blockage is from flesh grown in the body of the ear, then hold it with fine pincers, and cut it gently, until all that flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep in the ear, then take a fine light razor and heat it a little in the fire, then put it in the body of the ear.
If you feel the blockage where the patient feels difficulty in hearing, pierce gently, and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear; then put in the ear a tent according to the width of the hole, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment.
Do this for some days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and powder it with ground vitriol; and if you see the ear swollen, then you should remove the tent and replace it with another tent moistened in a cerote made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; then treat it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then plunge a sponge and cloths in cold water, and put it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop bleeding which are in the treatise on distillations.
On the flesh of the eyelids
These growths that come on the eyelids of the eyes when they are moist and are dry, it is necessary that you stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut them from their roots with a spatula; then put ground vitriol on the spot.
And if blood flows from it, then cauterize it with a subtle lenticular cautery, and cauterizing after the incision works better; and many times they return, when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, these roots are burned and do not return.
On hail (chalazion)
Many times there come in the eyelids of the eyes things that resemble hail in their form and hardness, and for this reason this illness is called "grandine," and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelid; the procedure is thus: observe if the hailstone moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to know; then cut it widely, then peel it carefully from each part, then take it with pincers, and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does no harm to the patient; and if the cut is large, then close it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed; and if it is small, do not force it, for the ointment will restore it soon and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone is descending to the inside of the eye towards the upper part, then turn the eyelid over, and stretch the hailstone with pincers, and cut it and press from one side and the other; and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, this does no harm; and when the hailstone is cut, then wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
On the fat of the eyes
Exinach is a fat that is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and greatly troubles their eyes, and catarrhes come to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes; and for this reason they lie on their faces constantly, and sleep thus, and their eyelids below their eyebrows are moist because the swelling and the appearance have covered the exinach that appears in the eye.
And when you press the spot with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the procedure is that the patient put his head in your lap; and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains exinach from each part, then put it on him; and press with your fingers from one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle; then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a cut of the width, and let it not be larger than the wound that one makes when bleeding a vein; and cut the skin deeply until you come to the exinach; and in several dispositions exinach comes from the cut, in the form of a piece of white fat.
Extract it then with a piece of lint cloth between your fingers on the outside, and turn your hand right and left until it is spread out; and take care not to probe into the incision, that you don't go all the way with the spatula to the eye, lest you wound it.
And if the exirnach does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then slightly increase the incision gently until it appears; then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and put them on the area, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and put it on to dissolve the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes to the area, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Of the hairs of the eyelids
When additional hairs grow on the eyelids besides the natural ones, and they have grown old, they harm the eyes, and cause types of diseases such as chronic tears and softening of the eyelids and white spots, such that it is a cause of destruction of the eyes; and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine as stated before in the chapter on cautery, and is done either by incision and suture or by chains, as I will describe.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand; if it is turned over, that is good; if not, then insert a needle with a thread above; and let this be beside the margin of the eyelid where the hair grows next to these hairs, and pull a thread above along with the eyelid, and turn it to the razor; then make an incision in the lower part of the eyelid, below the additional hairs, with the cutting spatula, from the large tear duct to the small one; then pull out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small tent of cotton and cloth, then mark on the eyelid a figure with ink, like a myrtle leaf, and always the figure must be according to the quantity that you wish to lift the eyelid which is divided for all.
And there are some who need a large quantity of the eyelid to be cut according to how softened the eyelid is; then make an incision with the spatula above the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a ray, then insert the hook in one of the two angles of the heart, then skin it all; then join the two lips with a suture of a needle with a fine wool thread, and dry the blood, and make the excess of the threads stick above the two eyebrows with some sticky substances, if you wish to do this; and if not, then don't worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days; then treat the wound without suture with drying and constricting things, for the eyelid rises with the healing of the wound and its joining, but the suture is better (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; and there is another method: and it is that you mark the eyelid with a figure that is like the myrtle leaf, as we have told, with three separate hooks according to the form which is here:
then cut what protrudes with small scissors evenly according to the form which is here:
And if you cannot hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread, and push it through the middle of the figure; and push another thread next to the large tear duct, and the second thread next to the small one, and gather the threads evenly between your fingers; then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have marked, as we have told, then join the two edges of the wound by suture, and treat it until it is healed; and if swelling comes to your incision, then soothe it with wax and similar soothing ointments; and sometimes it happens that the eyelid hairs are turned: so you must use what we have said about the incision; but the suture in both cases is more skillful.
The treatment of the reeds is according to this form: and it is that you turn the eyelid and split it inside according to what I said, and then make two reeds by art, and two subtle ties as long as the eyelid and the width of the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of two parts where you hold the threads; then join one and the other subtly above what protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten the two reeds of the two parts strongly; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin that was tightened will die and blacken and rot, until it falls by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with scissors, then treat it until it is healed; and when the wound will be sealed, and the eyelid will be raised, and the hairs will no longer prick; and this is the form of the two reeds that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
The work is such that you take a subtle needle, and push through it a soft and subtle silk thread; then gather the ends and tie one and the other subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long; then arrange in the case another subtle silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread; then put the patient's head in your lap; and let it be near the sun so that the work is illuminated, for this is subtle and minute work, then push the needle with the case into the root of the joined hair, and make it pierce the eyelid hastily until you draw it above the natural hair; then pull the hair up to the case, and push into the case that hair, if there is one or two or three or more; then pull your hand until the hair comes out with the case in the eyelid with the natural hair.
And if the case is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, then you will pull the case below with the thread that you have arranged there, until the case comes out of the hole above and that you see it by the vision of the eye; then you will pull the case and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for 2 or 3 days, until the hair adheres in its place and flesh grows over it; and if the hair is small, then accompany it with a long hair from the natural hairs, and let it be raised with that one where you leave it, until it is lengthened and then lift it.
about the rotting of the eye
When this disease which is called "aleacrati" or the rotting comes in the eye, there are two kinds of it: one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens by sudden wound, or by cutting or by cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that seal, and separate its edges, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed; and you must not use in its treatment things that dry and constrain.
For if you do this, the disease comes back worse than the first; but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and sprinkle it with water where marshmallow and linseed are cooked, and diachilon ointments melted in some of the oils, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with this.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you take care that it does not seal according to the form it was before; and this work that we have said is nothing but a correction of this disease, that it does not return according to the form it was before.
On flesh that grows in the eye
This disease which is below that is truly called "axacrati," and is both natural and accidental.
The accidental type comes from wounds and cuts and cauterization and similar things; and the way to operate on it is that you take a needle with a double thread, and stick it in the flesh, and pierce it from the left tear duct all the way to the right, so that the thread comes out in two ends from the flesh; then stretch the flesh upward with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
And if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that is good; if not, then take a razor and put it in the cut, and turn the eyelid, and make two cuts on the inside edge of the eyelid; and let the ends of the two cuts be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and let an angle be made so that when they are joined together, the shape is like that of a letter which is called "Greek I"; then remove that flesh, according to the quantity that its edge is sharp below, from what follows the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread; then treat it with what we have mentioned of softening medicines, and with dressings, until it is healed.
And if the disease comes from a cut or from suturing or from cauterization, it is necessary that you make a full cut below the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what was mentioned before; then separate between the two lips with a dressing, as I have said; and one must do the operation according to the form of the disease, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares his skill with all his power to make the shape return to its natural form; and the patient himself, according to what work and instruments are needed in various situations.
On the fusion of the eyelid
When this fusion happens to many men in such a way that the upper eyelid is fused with the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, it is therefore necessary that you push the point of a razor under the eyelid, and lift it up; and stretch it with pincers, until you cut what is attached with a fine spatula, which should not be too sharp or too cutting, so that the patient can bear it without the too-sharp spatula wounding the eye; and let your incision, with which you separate that joining, be gentle, so that the eyelid returns to its natural form; and all that joining is healed, and sometimes they pour salt water in the eye, and wash it with fresh water, and with eye drops; then put between the eyelid and the eye a linen dressing, and put on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after the third day use eye drops and healing substances until it is healed.
of the eye's ungula [pterygium]
Know that the ungula comes in 2 types: one is sinewy and resembling a hard membrane, and another that is not sinewy, but resembles congealed white moisture, which when touched with iron and one tries to grasp it with forceps, one cannot; and both types begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover all vision and all light and the movement of the eye.
And the method of incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then open his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then catch the ungula with small double forceps, and stretch it upward; then take a needle, and put in it a horse hair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and bend the needle point a little and stick it in the middle of the ungula, and pierce it with the needle, and tie the ungula with a thread and stretch it upward, and scrape with the hair the side of the ungula that follows the pupil and its silk to the hair up to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with the subtle spatula and with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh in the tear duct, so that through the incision the flow of tears does not come habitually; and sometimes the ungula extends to the hook only, and to the thread, as we have said; then one scrapes it with the gentle spatula of which here is the form:
And ensure that the spatula does not touch and break the fleshy membrane, and that the pupil is not pierced; and after the incision cast in the eye a little ground salt, and the collyrium made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is needed until it is healed.
And if the ungula is not sinewy, and you cannot insert the needle, and the hook cannot enter, many times this type of ungula is cured by medicines; and they grow as I have told in the division, and if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take the light spatula slightly sharpened according to this form:
And shave the ungula above subtly, and if you see that it diminishes at all and the shaving takes effect, then drip from your mouth into the eye collyrium made of litharge and red collyrium and ground salt, and close the eye until the next day; then restart the other work according to this same procedure, until it is all removed.
If something is adverse in the eye, such as hot abscess, then leave it, and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then restart the work as before, until it is healed.
And if the appearance of flesh from the tear duct harms the eye significantly, suspend it with the hook, and cut a part of it but not all, so that tear flow does not occur there; then drip red collyrium made of litharge into the eye.
of the flesh that grows on the pupil
In some men's eyes sometimes grows red flesh, and it covers the pupil and constrains upon the eyelids and turns them outward, and looks like a pomegranate flower; and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly; then cut the first flesh, and keep cutting with the razor until the end, and be careful not to wound the eye during the procedure; and let the incision be with the spatula that we mentioned in the incision of the nail and with small forceps with which one removes the sebel, as the illustration after this chapter shows; and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or apply red collyrium and similar corrosive medicines, and put cotton with egg white on the outside of the eye, so that it is protected from hot inflammation; and if anything remains, and hot blood overwhelms you, and you fear hot inflammation, then leave the eye and treat the inflammation with things that calm hot inflammation; then return to your procedure until it is healed, and do likewise when flesh has accumulated in the eye in this manner.
However, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each weak eye by the natural way; and by the accidental way, in work with iron; and do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that this member can bear that procedure.
of the veins of the eyes
Sebel are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they hinder the sight's function and weaken the eye continuously.
It is necessary then first that you look if the eye, in which sebel is, is strong, and has no other illness except the sebel; then gather it in this manner: command the patient to put his head in your lap, then suspend those veins with all the hook according to your wisdom, and let the hook be subtle double according to this form:
And let there be two hooks by degrees in one body according to this form:
then gather those veins subtly with forceps, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins remove from the eye; and be careful not to wound the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this procedure at noon before the sun, and be very fervent in your procedure so that you cut nothing but those veins; and when you have done this, then drip green and red collyrium in the eye to corrupt what remains of the sebel.
And if you don't have the power to gather all this in that hour, then make a plaster on the eye of things that calm the pain of eyes, and leave it some days until the pain is calmed and is secured from hot inflammation, then begin again according to this manner which is before until it is healed; and this is the form of the forceps:
On the eye fistula
The physicians call "arissati" fistula: when you treat it by cautery and by sharp burning medicine as I have said before, and it is not healed, here is a technique where you make an incision above the abscess, there where it should ripen, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and the blackness, then scrape it with the instrument of which here is the form; and it is called "rough head", and should be made of Indian iron with a round head, and should be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And put it on the place of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that this corruption is scraped; and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
If the place is sealed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the wound is sealed, and remains so for 40 days, and it does not renew and is not swollen, and no bad accidents come, know that it is healed; if not, there is no other technique than to bring the fistula to the hole of the nerve according to this form: which is that you expose the bone a second time by iron, and by sharp medicines, and when it is exposed then take a drill according to this form, and let the head be of iron with 3 angles, and the shaft be thinned to the head as you see here:
Then put it on the bone beside the tear duct, and distance your hand from the eye a little, then turn with the drill until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose; and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter goes to the nerve; so it is an easier thing for the patient.
On the protrusion of the eye
When the eye appears completely outside, and there comes no disturbance to the nerve, nor diminishment, then you must bind the patient; then bleed him, then put cupping glasses on the nape without cutting to suction, then put on the eye a bandage made of acacia and aloe and incense and sarcocolla, and then compress the eye, and plaster it over with bands and cloths; and the manner of the cloths is that you take cloths quite soft, and fold each in 4, and then put one on top of the other according to the quantity that the eye needs; then compress it from above with a hard band strongly, and restart the cupping glasses to suction without cutting; then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye compressed day and night, and if the bandage loosens, then you must compress it much; then remove the bandage after the day and night, and if you see the eye return, that is good; if not; then restart the plaster and the cloths and the bandage and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
On the rupture of the uveal membrane
When rupture comes in the uveal membrane, then appears, and comes out of the eyelids like a grape seed, and is frightful to see; then if you want to cut it, the procedure is such that you push a needle into the root from the lower part to the upper part, then push another needle which has a double thread from the part of the tear duct; and make it pierce through, and leave the first needle according to the disposition; then cut the place of the double thread and tie one part of the uvea around, and tighten it well, then remove the needle and put on the eye wool moistened in egg white; and leave it until the thread falls with the uvea, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed; and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uvea each part with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye gives great appearance, then pierce it with a subtle spatula which comes deep into the eye, and let the albuminous moisture run and let the eye descend, and enter in immediately; then remove it until it is healed.
"pus of the eye"
This disease which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but pus that has gathered in the eye, appearing like descending water, but it is not water; and the manner of performing the operation is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and upright seat, then take their head between your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the pus come to the top before your eyes; then it should be fixed there, and should not descend and the light should be cleared, and the patient should see things as they used to; and if it doesn't descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the pus is not arranged as we have said.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, then take the fine spatula and make an incision on the corneal membrane a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane and the corona, until the pus comes out; and when it has come out, then drip into the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
"waters of the eye"
We have already [discussed] the appearances of the waters in the division, and what is needed for piercing; so operate according to health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the sunlight, and bind their healthy eye very tightly; then put the eyelid of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right; then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda," or in your left hand, if the eye is right; then place the point of the instrument beside the corona by the thickness of a ray in that whiteness of the eye at the part of the lesser tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" forcefully, and turn your hand until it pierces into the whiteness of the eye, and feel that almagda comes to the empty thing; and the measure of the almagda's path should be to the depth of the measure of the space which is from the pupil up to the end of the blackness; and this is the corona of the eye; thus you will see the bone in that eyelid through the clarity of the corneal membrane, and you can put the instrument up to where the water is, then press it down one path after another.
If the water descends immediately, then the patient sees before them and the instrument in their eye.
Afterward rest a little, and if the water rises again the second time, put it out with the instrument, and when it is fixed in there and does not rise, then draw out almagda gently while turning your hand little by little; and then put back in the water a little rock salt, and wash the eye inside with this.
Then put outside the eye tow or wool moistened in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, put on ground cumin with egg white.
And if almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then it is necessary that you take the instrument which is called "alberit," of which here is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a fine opening, then insert almagda, as we have said; and at the completion of the work prepare for the patient a suitable bed, in which they should sleep on their back in a dark place; and they should be forbidden from all movements, and take light foods, and not move their head neither to right nor to left, and should be bound according to their condition until the third day; then unbind them in that same dark house, and test their sight, and make them see some things, and then put the binding back until the seventh day; and you should not do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but you should delay this, because the water rises hastily.
If hot swelling comes, you should unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which soothes swelling; and when it is calmed, then unbind the sight and put on their face a small pillow to cover for some days, and they should remain always in that dark house.
And then leave the house little by little, and return to your affairs; and know that no disciple should intervene in this case.
And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made perforated almagda, with which they suck water, but nevertheless I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the appearances of the forms of almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them; and they should properly be made of brass:
And their heads should be of the same subtlety, and the back end in three sharp angles.
of the flesh on the nose
Sometimes diverse flesh growths appear on the nose, of which some resemble scorpions with many feet; and there are some where there is cancerous flesh of dark color, and there is soft flesh of good color.
For those flesh growths that are soft, and not cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and insert the hook into those flesh growths, and pull them out; then cut what you can hold with the subtle spatula sharp on one side, until you know that all that flesh is removed.
And if something remains that cannot be cut, then work it with one of the subtle instruments gently, so that nothing remains; and if blood overwhelms you, or hot swelling, then treat it as needed; and if it is a malignant swelling, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stanched and all flesh is removed, then put vinegar and water or wine in the nose.
If the nose opens, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed; and if moisture does not penetrate as it should, know that there is flesh grown on the bone above, which the instrument cannot reach to cut: then you must insert a somewhat thick linen thread, and it should be tied with several knots, and have between each knot a finger's width or less; and have the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as far as he can, and pull while breathing in until it comes through the nose into the mouth; and many times children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it; then hold the end that comes through the nose with one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth with the other hand, and pull one after the other while sawing with the knots that are on the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before; do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of flesh; and then put a lead tube in the nose for some days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them; and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled in the nose:
And it should be of silver or brass, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit also; and if you want, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full for purging the head; and have a handle at the end to hold it when heating the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh on the nose
Many times there grows at the tip of the nose a disease that is called "telul", and it grows and becomes ever larger, until it is an ugly thing to look at; and therefore you should cut it at the beginning, and remove it all out, then put on the place the cautery or the burning medicine; and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then observe if it is hard, of dark color, of poor sense: do not touch it with iron for it is a cancerous growth, for when one cuts it sometimes, great harm comes to the patient; and if the growth is soft to touch, not of dark color, and you see that it can all be cut away, then prepare the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the place with drying and astringent things.
when the nose is cut and sewn
Know that when a solution of continuity comes in one of these cartilaginous works, it profits little, except in some men.
So when this happens to someone, look if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it heals; and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, you must scrape all parts of their core until they bleed, then join the two lips with a suture, and tighten it, and powder with dragon's blood powder, and ground incense; and put on the powders a piece of strong plaster or other binding plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The manner of suturing is that you join the solution: either with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the belly; or with thread, as I have made known to you.
of the apostemes of the lips
In many men there occurs inside the lips a hard aposteme, resembling grains of vetch, both smaller and larger; then you must turn the lips, and cut above each node, and take it with tweezers and cut it in each part; then fill the place after the incision with ground vitriol, until the blood is stanched; and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with dry things until it heals.
of the flesh of the gums
Many times grows on the gums added flesh, which the ancients call "albulus"; so you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow; then put on the place ground vitriol, or other astringent and desiccative powders; and if that flesh returns after the incision, which often happens, cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after the cautery; and these are the forms of instruments for cutting.
of the filth
Sometimes there are gathered at the head of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, shells that are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and citrine and green, so much that the corruption comes to the gum, and the teeth are foul; so you must have the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be in your lap, and scrape the teeth where the shells appear, until nothing remains; and do the same with the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and other stains, until they are cleaned; and if what is there is removed at the first scraping, that is good; if not, then begin scraping again the second day and the third, until you have scraped everything; and know that the teeth need different forms of instruments for scraping, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers used outside the teeth have other forms than those used between the teeth; and these forms and others should be prepared with you.
It is necessary when you treat the tooth for its pain that you delay pulling it as long as you can, for this must not be done; for it is a very noble substance until there is no excuse for scraping.
Then when the patient is constrained to pull it, you must be certain of the aching tooth.
Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks it is in the healthy tooth, and has the good tooth pulled; and yet the pain does not depart because of this, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this happen to these lords; and when you are quite certain of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides; then move it with your fingers or with subtle tongs at first little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly fix the tongs; and let the patient's head be in your lap between your knees, and hold him well so that he does not move.
After, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it doesn't come out, then take one of these instruments and gently insert it on each side, and move it as you did at first.
And if the tooth is pierced and eaten away, you should fill it with small cloths where the holes are; and grip it carefully with pincers, so that it doesn't break when gripping; and you must work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, with a part remaining, and greater pain than the first returning to the patient due to the malice of the root.
And beware not to do as the ignorant healers do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the jaw, and don't administer what we have described; but sometimes cause great illness through this occasion due to the roots that remain, or due to the jaw they break, as we have often seen; and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt; and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with ground vitriol; and if that doesn't work, cauterize it.
The forms of the instruments, with which one first moves the teeth, should have long points and thick handles, so they don't bend when you pull the tooth; and these are the forms:
And they should have thick members so they don't bend when pulling, and should be made of well-crafted Indian iron, and should be toothed for better grip.
concerning the roots of teeth
When the root remains after extraction, you should place cotton soaked in butter on the area for one or two days,
until the area is softened, then insert the pincers called "algefri," whose head resembles a swan's beak; and they should be made inside like a file and this is the form:
And if the roots won't come out with these pincers, you must uncover the flesh all around the root, and insert the instrument called "althali," that is to say a lever, of which here is the form:
And it should be strong and thick so it doesn't break, and if the root comes out by this, that's good; if not, then help yourself with all the instruments, of which the forms come hereafter:
And one can also use this instrument which has two prongs, of which here is the form:
And other iron tools which are used in front for scraping teeth, and this instrument which resembles large forceps, of which here is the form:
And this instrument should be strong so it cannot break, and know that there are many dental instruments; and also other instruments, which are not counted; and the wise subtle master finds his own instrument by himself, according to what his work and the disease shows him, for there are such diseases where the ancients did not teach any instrument due to their diversity; and if any part of the jaw or other bones breaks, or it rots, then search for the instruments that are needed, which I have told you about, and help yourself with the tools, of which here is the form:
And they should be thick and grip well to hold the bone, so it doesn't escape, but can be held and removed; and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When teeth appear not according to natural form, and the shape is ugly, especially in young women, it is necessary that you know if the tooth grew after another tooth, and is not in the right place, and cannot be sawed or filed: then scrape it; and if it is attached to another tooth, take this instrument of which here is the form, and it resembles a small beak, and should be made of sharp Indian iron at the tip:
And cut it little by little over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that you don't move the others, and if it appears that it can be filed, then file it with such a file as shown here:
And it is like the file used to make needles; and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it doesn't move until it falls; then smooth it at the end with some rasp, and if the tooth is too sharp and hurts the tongue, it's necessary to file the roughness until it's even, so that it neither hurts the tongue nor impairs speech.
When teeth are loose
When front teeth are loose, either from a blow or from falling, and the patient cannot press on what they eat without them falling, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this doesn't work; then they must be secured with a gold wire, for silver wire turns green and rots, but gold never changes; and the wire should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth; and if you want to straighten the teeth, take the wire and push it double between two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, if there are one or more, until you carefully reach the healthy tooth on the other side; then begin the covering again until the part where you started, and tighten your hand subtly and carefully, so that it doesn't move at all; and your binding should be at the root of the tooth so it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the wire with pliers, and join them, and hide them between the healthy teeth, and put it so that it doesn't hurt the tongue; and then leave it tight as long as it can stay, and if it comes undone, or the wire breaks, tighten it with another wire; it will stay and serve thus all its time, and this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of the two healthy teeth, and the two loose ones, as you see:
And when a tooth falls out, put it back in its place, fresh to fresh, as we have said; and let no one undertake this who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes the form of a tooth from cow bone, and puts it in the place where there is a gap, and tightens it as we have said, and it stays and serves thus for a long time.
On cutting the tongue-tie
Sometimes this tie that comes under the tongue is either natural, that one is born with it; or by accident from a healed wound; and the procedure is such that you open the mouth of the patient, and hold their head in your lap, and lift the tongue; then cut the nervous tie widthwise, until the tongue is freed from its restraint, and if there is hardness or knot, and this is from wound healing, then insert the hook and cut that tie widthwise; and be careful that the cut is not too deep, because of the artery that is below; and when you have done this, wash the area with rose water and vinegar, or with cold water, then put a linen tent under the tongue; and the patient should hold it each night, so that the area cannot heal shut.
And if bleeding occurs, put ground vitriol on the area; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentil-shaped cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other treatment until it is healed,
and if you see it is of dark color or black or hard, such that the patient cannot feel it, do not touch it at all, for it is cancer; and if it is tending toward whiteness, and there is moisture, insert the hook, and cut it with a thin spatula, and free it from one side to the other; and if the blood overcomes you in your work, put ground vitriol on it until it is stanched, then return to your work until you draw everything out; then wash the area with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
On abscesses of the throat
Sometimes swellings come inside the throat which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then take note: if it is a hard abscess with little sensation and of dark color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is thick, do not touch it with iron, also because of bleeding; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will split it, or it will break by itself; and if it is of white color, round, and the root is thin, then have the instrument for cutting ready, but first look to see if the hot abscess has settled and is calmed.
Then have the patient sit before the sun, and their head should be in your lap, and open their mouth and let the assistant take it between his hands, and press the tongue down with the instrument, of which here is the form; and it should be of silver or of fine brass like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it out upward as much as you can; and draw some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which here is the form, that resembles scissors; and always the heads are curved, and one toward the other, and are very sharp, and is made of Indian iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument present, then cut it with pincers, of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp on one side, and not on the other; and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision have the patient gargle with hot water, and water and vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves have been boiled, and similar things, until the blood is stanched; then treat until healed; and sometimes other swellings grow in the throat besides the two tonsils, so cut them just as you would cut the two tonsils equally.
And I treated a woman for a swelling that had grown inside her throat, that is to say a swelling of little sense; and it had nearly closed the entire throat, so that the woman could not breathe through the passage which was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained so for a day or two.
And the swelling had already grown so much that it had pushed out two branches through the two nostrils.
I therefore hastened at once, and inserted a hook into one, then pulled it out, and drew out a large portion of pus; then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; after I inserted the hook in these swellings, and cut away a part, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was unblocked, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease cutting away at this swelling for a long time; and the swelling would always grow back, and fill the space that I had emptied, until it became very large again; then I devised a way and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing; and I departed from these parts, and knew not what God did with her after me.
of the uvula
When rheum descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular"; and if it is thick and round at the bottom, it is called "uvula."
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot swelling has subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it; and that which is round and gathered and not long; and if it is bloody or of dark color or black, you must avoid cutting it.
For there is great peril for the patient.
It is necessary therefore, when you see it, according to the manner I have described, of its whiteness and its length, that you have the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention above; then insert the hook in the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils.
And you must not cut away more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit; for if you cut more, you harm the voice and speech; and after the incision, use what we have mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils, and treat until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of cutting, then you must use skill in cauterizing it without fear.
And the manner of cautery is with a sharp needle.
And it is that the patient puts his head in your lap, and then press the tongue with the instrument that we mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and mix with quicklime, so that it is neither too thick nor too clear; and fill the hollow of this instrument, of which here is the form:
And have at the head a hollow where one puts the medicine, like the hollow of a spoon, and put the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula; and the patient should lie on his side, so that the saliva and mucilage flows from his mouth from the medicine within, so that it does not descend to the throat and hurt him; then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula for half an hour, until you see it blacken and the burning of the medicine is calmed; and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it on some instrument, and wet the cotton in the medicine, and push the instrument with the cotton in the tube above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula; and do this often, until the cautery is perfect, then let it dry, and it falls after 4 or 5 days. And if you need to restart the cautery with the medicine, then restart it, and after the cautery wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and clean what is around from the medicine; and let it be sprinkled with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This cure is safer than incision or cautery; if it is treated with fumigation according to this manner, take calamint and hyssop and oregano and rue and chamomile and southernwood and similar herbs, and gather them all or some of them in a pot, and put vinegar in it, and make it boil; and the pot should be well sealed with strong earth, and in the middle of the pot have a hollow instrument according to this manner:
And let it be of silver or brass, and let one of the ends be put in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is mortified; after that restart often, until the uvula dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the arrival of hot swelling, because many things can happen; and do not do this except at the decline of hot swelling.
And if this instrument is not present, then take a tube and put inside the head an eggshell, so that the patient's mouth does not get too hot; for the eggshell does not let the vapor harm the mouth, and this is a good cure together with safety.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or some thing sticks to the throat; so it is necessary that you pull out what you can see, and press the tongue in the sunlight with the instrument, so that you see the thing better; and what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the stuck thing will come out through vomiting; or let the patient swallow a piece of sponge, or a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then let him swallow it; and when it comes to the place, it will stick, and then you will pull it out; and if it does not come out from what we have said, then take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, lest coughing come to him, nor push the bone inward; and it is better that the patient puts in the instrument himself, because he better knows where the thing is stuck; so push it down, or pull it out with the instrument evenly, until it is out.
On the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I said in the section, through the treatment of medicines; and when this does not help, then look in the patient's throat in sunlight, after you press their tongue with the instrument I told you about.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps that are suitable for this.
And if this doesn't work, take a hollow reed, and put it in the patient's throat, then put a hot iron in the hollow of the reed, and do this often.
And let the patient abstain from water all day.
Then take a glass full of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with their hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls.
And if it doesn't fall as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, using the instrument that I mentioned for the fumigation of the uvula; do this many times, for it will fall without delay.
And the manner of fumigation is that you take a pot containing live coals, and let the pot be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole should be the head of the instrument; then add your fumigation, and the patient should put the head of the reed in their mouth, and close the mouth, so that the smoke doesn't escape, but reaches the leech; and the leech will fall immediately, and if it doesn't fall, repeat the fumigation many times; and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty things and garlic, and drink no water; and then it will be necessary that it comes out through this treatment.
And the form of the instrument with which one pulls out the leech, when one can see it, is similar to curved forceps to better enter the throat; and it should resemble a swan's beak, and have roughness like a file, so that what it grips, it cannot release; and here is its form:
The chapter on abscesses
There are many types of abscesses, according to what is remembered here after one and another in this book, and they are different in perforation and in cutting; and this is in two ways, one of which is in its very appearance, and in what moisture it contains.
And the second way is according to the places where they are on the body.
For the abscess of the head is different from that of the fundament, and the abscess of the fleshy place is different from that which comes in joints, and each has its judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that one must not pierce until the pus is mature according to its completion; and there are some that must be pierced when they have grown, and do not mature according to their completion, like abscesses that are near joints.
For when an abscess comes near joints, and one leaves it until it is rotted around, by chance the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or the abscess is near the principal member, and if you delay the perforation until it is mature, it will harm the principal member; or it is near the fundament, so one pierces it before it is mature; and one must not pierce a grown abscess without complete digestion, except for that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply, and be prolonged inside, and a fistula come there; and it cannot heal for a long time.
And you must know the time of perforation of the abscess which is mature according to completion, and this is when the pain is calmed, and the departure of the fever, and the lessening of the pain and of the redness, and of the throbbing and of the sharpness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs; and you must make the perforation at the most dependent place of the abscess, and where it appears best; and let the perforation be lengthwise of the body, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints and on nerves and arteries, and in all equal places where there is no folding.
In those that bend, according to that member.
When an abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better that you leave the perforation until complete digestion is confirmed, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the course of its venom will be prolonged, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and its depths will harden.
And there are some abscesses that are pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small holes for small abscesses; and for large abscesses, large holes, and many incisions according to the appearance of the size of the abscess; and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to hollow out the core, and cut; when it has already become like a cloth, and is deadened, it is necessary to do as one does with pustules: and there are some that are cut in three angles, and there are some where one cuts like the leaf of a myrtle, as with abscesses in the corners; and there are some where one makes a round cut, and other cuts and similar incisions.
Those that have no head, like a superficial soft abscess, it is necessary that you pierce them plainly; and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, do not draw out all the pus at that hour, but draw out a part; then plug the abscess until the next day, then draw out some again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out; especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small child, or decrepit old man.
For the spirit sometimes escapes with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Avoid therefore this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, dry the wound, and look if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a plain cut, administer tents of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many holes, it is necessary that you put in each one a tent so that they come one against the other; and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have hollowed it around, it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton or with scraping of linen cloths without moisture, and bind it until the third day; then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your operation, administer cold water and vinegar, and wet a cloth, and put it on the bleeding place many times.
And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and cure, and the powders that I have mentioned in many places in this book, and if it is in winter time, and the place where the abscess is is very sinewy, it is necessary that you put on tents and cloths moistened in wine and in hot oil; and if it is in summer, and the place is fleshy, it is necessary that you put on cloths moistened in water and oil, or in wine and cold oil, until the third day, as we have said; and then unbind the abscess and dry it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in cures of abscesses: now I have told you how one must proceed with cures of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
About tumors
In the flesh of the head come small swellings, and they are types of nodes that are in membranes, like a hen's crop, and there are many varieties of them.
Some are fatty and some contain moisture like pus; and there are some that are hard and stone-like when cut, and there is no doubt unless the artery poses a problem.
And the procedure of cutting is that you examine with an instrument called an "probe," whose form comes hereafter, what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, split it lengthwise from above.
And when the moisture is emptied, peel off without leaving anything the skin that contains this moisture, for it always returns when something is left; then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available; if not, in water and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day; and this will corrupt what remains of the nest.
And then restart with the cotton, as before, the second day, and the third, until you know well that none of the nest remains; then treat the wound with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the swelling contains a fatty node, cut it according to this form, lengthwise; and insert your hooks, and peel it from all sides, and put all your effort into drawing out the sac in which it lies; and if the artery poses a problem, do what I told you after.
And do the same for the swelling if it is stone-like, both in cutting and treating as I told you.
And the cut above the stone-like swelling and the moist one is easier, for they contain little blood.
And there are some of these swellings in the head where there is no moisture, and of these was a swelling that I cut from an old woman's head; and I found the swelling like a deaf stone, rough and white, and could not break; and if one had struck someone with it, it would have made a wound just like a stone.
In other swellings coming to the head, except those that come to children's heads and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, to better drain the pus; and treat them as appropriate.
About scrofulas
Many times these swellings come to the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins, and sometimes come elsewhere in the body, and are numerous, and are engendered one with another.
And each scrofula is properly within its sac, like the nodes and swellings of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that will not yield to health.
Therefore in those that you see of good disposition to the touch, and are similar to the color of the body, and move from each side and are not attached to the nerves of the neck nor to the artery nor to the passage, and are not deep; it is appropriate that you cut it from above, and peel it from each part, and spread the two lips of the flesh with hooks, if you need them, as we have said in swellings of the head; and draw it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let not the spatula be sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far forward, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this prevents you from working, put ground vitriol in the wound, or some powders that stop blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the swelling has calmed, and the wound has softened, and begins to rot.
And when the blood is stopped, return to your work, until you complete it; then search with your index finger if any small scrofulas remain, and cut them and clean them out.
And if there is a large vein in the root of the scrofula, you should not cut this scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm; then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut out the entire scrofula, it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, since no superfluity has remained due to the size of the scrofula.
It is necessary that you focus on cutting its root, and pulling it out, and sew it as we have said.
Those scrofulas that contain superfluity, pierce there where it appears ripe; and pierce it like the aforementioned one, downward, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleaned, treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
On quinsy
The ancients spoke and talked about cutting the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the split of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that no aid be given through this, because all the veins and the lung of the sick person are like those who have hot aposteme in the mouth, or in the throat or in both tonsils.
When the illness is in the windpipe, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the destruction that comes from strangulation.
It is necessary therefore, when we want to split the epiglottis, that we split it below three or four rings with a small crosswise split, between the two rings or by the quantity of the split of the membrane, not in the cartilage; and this place is suitable for the section of the epiglottis as there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far from there.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then split the skin until he reaches the windpipe; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see any, and then cut the membrane, as we have said; and it is shown by the section of the phlegm of the windpipe which jumps out through the place that is broken, and by the loss of voice; and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the hour has passed during which one fears strangulation, bring together the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage; then administer medicines that make flesh grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely blocked, and the patient is judged to be dying, and breath fails him.
Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death; and for this reason the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they commanded to sew the wound and treat it, until it was healed; and I will tell you what I saw.
I saw that a young lady took a knife, and stuck it in her throat, and cut part of the windpipes; and I was called to treat her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had come out of it, and knew well that she had not cut any vein or passage except the throat, and the wind came out through the wound.
I hurried, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the young lady except that she became hoarse of voice, and returned afterward to her disposition; therefore I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there should be no fear.
About the thick throat
This abscess is called "throat hernia," and is a large abscess the color of a pea, and is common in women; and it is of two types: natural and accidental; for the natural one there is no remedy.
And the accidental one is of two types, of which one resembles fatty nodes, and the other type resembles an abscess that comes from arterial nodes; and there is danger, and one should not operate with iron except on those that are small, and test and examine it with the probe: if you find it like a fatty node, and it's not attached to any vein, then cut it, as one cuts nodes, and remove it with its membrane, if there is any; and examine everything well, and treat it as needed, until it is perfectly healed.
About nodes
There are many types of nodes, of which I will describe all appearances; and now I must tell all the difference between node and discharge.
I say that discharge has heat and persistent fever, until the inflammation has passed, and the suppuration is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With the node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a membrane, which is its proper sac and is the color of the body, and begins like a pea, and becomes large; and they are of two types, either fatty or moist, and many colors exist as I have said in the classification.
It is necessary, when you come to treat the node, that you test and examine it first with the instrument called "probe," according to the form that will come in the chapter that follows.
And the manner of examining node abscesses is that you take the most moist place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then let it be according to the size of the abscess; then withdraw the probe, and pay attention to what comes out.
If flowing moisture flows out, whatever color it has, cut it as I have said about other abscesses; and if after the probe no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, so cut it in a cross shape, and take it with pincers, and carefully skin it from each side and preserve the covering in which it lies so that you remove it intact with the node; and if you cannot remove it intact, then remove it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the node returns many times; and if a little remains, and the blood troubles you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and tighten the wound, and put on things that calm hot abscesses, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed; and if the node is large, then sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which generates flesh.
And if the beating vein opposes you or another then hurry and fill the place with ground vitriol, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound suppurates, and the blood's ebullition subsides; then return to cutting what remained of the node.
Here are the forms of probe instruments, and they are of three types: large and medium and small; and there are three square ones which are called "albaret," and one which is called "breb," and there are three types: large, medium, and small, for examining fistula abscesses; and they are like the needles with which one sews eyebrows, and they are of yellow brass, or iron, or silver, and those that are yellow are worth more, and black lead ones are more tested for examining the curves of fistulas; and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the holes.
The shapes of hooks are of many kinds, as you see here: large, medium, and small; and there are hooks that have 2 curves of 3 types also; and there are hooks that have 3 curves, and are also of 3 types; and there are hooks that have 2 curves, and hooks with only one curve, and they are of 3 types; and all of these are necessary in their place.
The heads of these with which one cuts are sharp, and some of them only cut on one side, with which one scrapes the nodes, so as not to cut the vein or nerve; and of these implements the blades are hidden in handles, so that the patients do not notice them when opening abscesses; and they are of 3 types: large, small, and medium, as you see; and they are only used in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in corners, and in similar places; and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to pistachio shells, according to this form, with which one stanches blood:
and sometimes one puts it in the place that bleeds from cutting of veins, and arteries, and sometimes round according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, so much that they resemble women's breasts; and they remain ugly and swollen, and if one wants to cure them, it is necessary to cut according to this form from this line .b. to .g.:
then scrape away the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then join the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed; and if the breast hangs down, and is softened by its size as happens to women, cut it on two sides above, with two similar incisions; of which one should be connected to the other at the end of one and the other, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line .b. to line .g.; then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed; and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of blood flow, it is necessary that you fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it eats away the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
about armpit abscesses
These abscesses that come under the armpits are types of hard scrofulas where there are coverings, and there are some that contain moisture.
Those therefore that contain moisture should be cut according to this form, from line .b. to line .g.:
And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of scrofulas, cut it as we have said in cutting of scrofulas, and if the wound produces pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
Title: "Of the rupture of the artery"
"When the artery is broken, and the skin above it is healed, it often results in abscesses, and the same happens with swollen veins and abscesses; and one recognizes it thus when it's from the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a constriction; and when it's from the vein, it is round and visible from outside; and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the corners and on the neck and in many other places, and is very large."
"It is therefore necessary to avoid treatment with iron, and that which is at the head must also be avoided, and in that which is from swelling of the artery, cut lengthwise above the skin; then open the cut with hooks, and gently separate the artery from the membranes, until it is exposed; then push a needle underneath it, and make it pierce through to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples; then pierce the place between the two ties with a probe until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is relieved; then administer the treatment that generates pus, until the ties fall off; then treat it with suitable ointment until it is healed; and if the abscess is from the cut of the vein, you must hold in your hand what you can of the abscess with all the skin, then push the needle under the place that you hold in your hand, and make it pierce through, and have a double thread, so that you pull it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I told you, with the tie of one of two parts at the two ends of the thread; and if you fear that the threads might come out, push another needle with a thread under all the abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places; then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess of the skin and leave what is tied; then put on it a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed."
Title: "Of the abscesses of the nerves"
"Just as abscesses come in the artery and in the vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are struck, or through too much work, and similar things."
"And this happens more often to the upper arms and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in several conditions without pain; and when one presses it firmly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin; and it moves well from all sides, and goes neither forward nor backward, nor below nor above, and that which is in joints must not be cut by iron: by chance contraction would come; and that which is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with the spatula."
"If the abscess is small, hold it with pincers, and cut it at its root; and if it is large, suspend it with the hook, and flay it, then remove it and join the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed."
of hanging large lumps
Sometimes thelul occurs in bellies and nowhere else, and it is a disease called "fungus" due to its resemblance to them, and its root is thin, and the head large; and there are small and very large ones; and I saw a man who had two in his belly that resembled fungi more than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had thin roots, and were already split, and moisture constantly ran from them.
I cut them and found in one eighteen ounces by weight, and in the other six ounces, and the procedure for the incision is that you observe if the patient is moist, and the color of the thelul is white and moist and has a thin root; then cut it with a wide spatula, and have the cautery irons in the fire ready in your presence.
For when cutting there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize; and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the iron's incision, take a well-made lead thread, and tie the thelul as we have said, and leave it for two days; and then tighten it, and do not cease tightening the lead thread until it cuts the thelul, and it falls by itself without effort; and if the roots are thick, there is fear in cutting especially because of the belly, but you can well cut half of it, then cauterize it so it doesn't return; then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the thelul which is dark in color and of poor sense and ugly appearance.
For this is a cancerous aposteme, and I will come to the treatment of cancer hereafter.
when the bowel comes out
If the appearance of the bowel comes through cautery of a wound or splitting of the syfac, and is on the belly and some of the bowels come out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood that runs from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from windiness; and if it is through the rupture of the syfac and through the exit of the bowel, then the color of the aposteme resembles the color of the body, and is an easy thing without pain, and appears from diverse exit.
And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with one's fingers it hides itself, and then returns, and by chance it is compressed, and grows much upon entering the bath and through strong work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is an easy thing, and appears well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrict; and if it is due to blood, the aposteme appears by these signs large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to windiness, it is soft to touch, and the procedure is that you observe if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or from the vein, or windiness.
Then you must abandon the treatment.
For there is doubt and fear about it, as I told you in the chapter on apostemes, because of the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is for the intestine or the bowel, you should command the patient to hold their breath, and be stretched out straight, then mark with ink all around the bulge; then command them to lie supine between your hands, then go around the place that you have marked with the spatula, then stretch half of the abscess above with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or with a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the binding be loose; then open half of the abscess stretched above the binding, and put your index finger in it, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught in the binding, untie it, and push the intestine to the outside of the belly; and if you find the bowel, take it with the hook, and cut off the excess; and if the artery gives you trouble, or the vein, go gently around it, then return to your work and take 2 needles, and put in 2 strong threads, and put the 2 needles around what you have made in a cross that you made pierce; then tighten the abscess in 4 places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it has become thin and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and dig out the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place with what is necessary, and seal the place.
About cancer
We have spoken in the division about the appearances of cancer, and how one should work with medicines, and how one should avoid treatment with iron; and we speak of cancer engendered in the womb, and great caution is needed in the treatment, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where one can scrape it as cancer that is in breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, one should remove it all when it is in the beginning; and when it is large and old, you should not approach it, for I could never heal any; nor did anyone heal any before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where one can remove it, as we have said, is that you purge sometimes the patient of black bile; then make them bleed if they have manifest repletion, then prepare the patient a good place to do the procedure; then throw your hooks in the cancer, and dig it out from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything; and let all the blood run out, and squeeze the place well with your hand or with something, and if the running of blood gives you trouble from the incision of the artery or the vein, then cauterize it until the blood is stanched; then treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
About dropsy
We have already spoken in the division about the appearances of dropsy, and in what manner the gathering of water is made, and the signs of each appearance, and the treatment that is made by medicines, and that which is treated by iron: it is only ascites; and one should not touch with iron in these 2 appearances: that is to say, tympanites and hyposarca, for it is a deadly thing; therefore when you treat this appearance of dropsy which is called "ascites" with medicines, and the treatment does not profit, then look if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness than dropsy, such as cough and looseness of belly and similar things; then do not touch with iron, for there is doubt; and if you see the patient of strong virtue, and they have no other illness than dropsy only, and they are not too young nor too old, then you should work thus: raise the patient straight up with your hands, and let the assistants press the belly pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spiny spatula according to this form:
And let it be sharp on both sides.
With a point, and yet not so penetrating that it might reach the intestine when inserted, and cannot wound it; then see if the dropsy is generated near the intestines: in which case you must make an incision three fingers away from the navel straight below towards the groin; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, make your incision three fingers to the left of the navel; and if it's due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the excess fluids do not run to this weak spot; then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the peritoneum as if skinning to the length of a fingernail or thereabouts; then pierce the peritoneum until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is where the water is, then pull it out, and insert this instrument of which here is the form:
And it resembles a thin silver tube, and is made of brass or light silver, and has at the bottom part a small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on another side, and one on another; and the head is cut like a quill pen, and this is the form of the incision that the scribe makes to cut the pen:
At the upper end is the blade, so that when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately descends onto the instrument; then empty half or a third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient might die from the dissolution of his spirit of the soul, or he might faint, or approach death; but empty according to the quantity of his strength, and according to what the conditions of the patient's strength indicate, and his pulse; then withdraw the instrument and retain the water, and it is immediately retained by the flesh that blocks the hole that is above the peritoneum, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner; then reinsert the instrument the next day, if you see the patient bearing this, and draw out a small quantity of water; do this for some days, and be careful not to err until there remains only a little water.
And if you have doubts about the patient, and you leave much water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and by much sweating in the bath and in the sun, and let him abstain from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize over the stomach and over the liver and over the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
On the blockage of the penis
Sometimes children are born who have no hole in the penis, or the hole is small, or it is not in its proper place.
So it must be pierced as soon as it is born with a very fine spatula according to this form:
Then put in the hole a thin lead nail, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days and when he needs to urinate, remove the nail, and let him urinate, and then put it back; and perhaps none is needed, for the urine that comes out will not let it close.
Those whose hole is small are treated with the lead nail, as we have said, so it will enlarge.
Those who do not have the hole in its place are injured, for some are born who have the hole at the head of the penis, because of which they cannot urinate forward unless they lift their penis up; and they cannot procreate because the material cannot reach the womb, and this is a bad disease.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient lies supine on his back, then extend the head of the penis and cut it like the cut of a quill pen, so that the hole falls in the middle, as it should be; and beware of blood flow which often comes, and if it happens, then stanch it with that which stanches blood, and treat the wound until he is healed.
Title: On pustules of the penis
Many times these albathes (pustules) come on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh; and there are malignant and non-malignant ones; thus it is necessary that you take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then put cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment on it; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the albathe is malignant, of foul color and stinking, it is necessary that you apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the albathe is on the tip of the penis, and has part inside the skin and part outside, it is necessary that you remove the albathe that is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat them together, the head of the penis is not secured from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the tip of the penis and to the testicle; thus it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupted, then bind on it a plaster of honey and flour that is made of pomegranate peel and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then administer the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery thus helps with two conditions together: that is to say, the bleeding, and the corruption; and if the head of the penis is corrupted and withdrawn, it is necessary that you insert into the urethral canal a lead tube, and the patient urinates through it; and when the skin is stuck to the head of the penis which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens because of a wound or an abscess, it is thus necessary that you separate it with a hollowed instrument, until the binding is undone, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides; and if this is difficult to separate, it is necessary that you separate with a spatula some of the head of the penis and the skin; then gently separate between the two, and put there a fine linen cloth soaked in cold water, so that it doesn't stick again.
On circumcision
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however when we do this work of our own will, and properly on children, it is necessary that we do the best work, and the easiest for health.
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, for they do not use it in their law, and we have only what we have acquired through experiment.
For I have seen the greater part of the masters and elders who performed circumcision around with a thimble, and with scissors, and with a razor; so the heart fled for there are two membranes, and by chance one cuts the upper one and the lower one remains.
Now it must be cut again, and the pain is double, and with the cleaning that is done with the thimble the point of the member is not secured; and with the cleaning of the nail perhaps the iron escapes, and corrupts the work, and many times they are born such that they have no need of cleaning and I have seen it.
Of the cleaning that is done with scissors with all the binding of thread I have found the goodness of experiment, for the scissors cut justly as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, cut evenly in one single motion; but make sure the thread is very tight around the skin; and the manner of the first operation is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are doing nothing but tying the thread around the penis only, and then make him rejoice in all the ways that you can; then make him stand straight between your hands, and hide the scissors between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments; then push your hand to the penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it up until the head of the penis is inside; then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it a little below with another tie; and hold it with two fingers by the second tie with the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the foreskin above and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood run little by little, for that is best; and put powder on it and on the powder put a cloth glued with an egg yolk cooked in rose water, mixed with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatment until it heals.
The form of the scissors for the cleaning is this: the two ends should be thin and sharp, and the ends should be as large as the handles equally:
The error of cleaning is when the inner foreskin flees at the incision; then you must stretch it with your nail, before the place forms an abscess; and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your nail, hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is below the penis is swollen, leave it until the hot abscess has calmed, and skin it lightly; cut it as best you can, and be careful of the part of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Therefore treat the place with things that heal wounds with powder, which we have mentioned in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts the foreskin beyond measure, and it goes above, it will not harm; treat it therefore, as we have said, until it heals.
On the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from blockage by stone, or by congealed blood, or by pus, or by grown flesh, or by similar things, which we have mentioned in the division; and if the urine is not released, and you see the retention is because of the stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, it is necessary that the patient be bent over his knees; and his feet should be put on his back, and stretch his belly from the part above the back, and the patient should hold his breath as long as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constrained to expel the stone upward, whereby the urine is released; and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, it is necessary that you administer extraction with the instrument that is called "syringe", of which here is the form: and it should be of subtle light silver, hollow like a bird's feather; and the shaft should be a palm and a half long, and be subtle at the end.
And the manner of the release of urine is that you take a double thread, and tie at the end a little wool or cotton, and push the end of the thread inside the syringe; and cut the excess of the wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a seat, and moisten his bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water; then gently put the syringe in the penis, until it comes to the root of the penis, then double the penis above toward the navel; then push the syringe forward until the bladder, and let the patient feel it come to the empty thing, and this is not done according to this order except because the channel where it goes is twisted; then extend the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out, and let the urine flow; and restart the syringe until the bladder is empty, and the patient is relieved.
On diseases of the bladder
When there are abrasions or blood in the bladder, or pus has collected there, and you want to distill waters and medicines into it, do so with the instrument called "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has 3 holes: 2 on one side, and 1 on the other, as you can see; and the hollow place through which the medicine flows should be such that it blocks the penis well without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture and push when needed; and when you want to inject your medicines into the bladder, put the head of the container in the moisture, and pull on the plunger that is inside; you will draw the moisture into the container, and then push the plunger back in forcefully; the moisture will enter and will come to the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it; and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one administers an enema to the bladder: it is here:
And it is made of silver or brass, and the head is higher; and below there is a notch where the binding falls; then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the moisture with which you want to give an enema to the bladder, then tie it strongly between the two notches with a good double thread, and heat this moisture a little over the fire; then push the head of the clyster into the penis, then press your hand on the bladder with all the moisture appropriately, until the patient feels that this moisture has already reached the bladder; and if you don't have the bladder, take a piece of parchment, and make a circle of it, and pierce it round about; then put a strong thread in these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a thimble, and put inside what you want of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument; and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.
On the stone
We have already spoken in the division about the types of stone, and extraction together with medicines; and I have spoken of the difference between stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stone one must operate by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis; and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder happens more often to children, and this is a sign that the water jumps from the bladder resembling water in its subtlety; and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs many times, and then becomes rigid; and in many of these the fundament protrudes; and the healing is easy in children until they are 4 years old, and is very difficult in old men, and is moderate in young men, in those who are between youth and old age; and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient by clyster, to draw out all the waste that is in the intestines.
For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and push him and move him downward, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes jumps from the high place; then make him sit prepared between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is all declining downward; then search for it and touch inside; if you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately to cut upon the stone.
And if it does not fall completely to the touch, then wet your index finger with oil of your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a complete youth; and push it into his fundament, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, bring it to the neck of the bladder; then press upon it with your finger, and push it outward there where you want to cut.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and command him to extend with his right hand the testicles upward, and with his left hand remove the skin that is below the testicles in the part where one makes the cut; then push in the cutting spatula, of which this is the form:
And he cuts between what is between the testicles and the fundament, not in the middle but on the left side of the buttock; and it should be straight above the stone, and your finger should always be in the fundament, and the cut should be crosswise so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large; perhaps the pressure of the finger that is in the fundament will make it jump out without effort; and know that there are stones that have angles and margins: these are difficult to remove; and there are those that are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, whose removal is easy.
For those that have angles and margins, make the cut larger; and if it doesn't jump out, you must grip it with forceps that are like a file at the tip, to better grip the stone so it doesn't escape; or push underneath it a subtle instrument curved at the tip; and if you cannot manage it thus, enlarge the opening a little, and if blood flows, compress it with vitriol; and if there is more than one stone, push the largest one first to the neck of the bladder, then cut above it, then pull it out, and the small ones after if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawed, and make a larger wound.
For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine always comes through there because the place cannot heal; but still strive to extract it, or to break it with forceps, until you extract it in pieces; and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and compress it, and put above it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to calm the hot aposteme; then lay the patient back on his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, water the area well with oil and water, then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot apostemes come in the wound and corrosions, and blood clotting in the bladder, and through this the urine is retained, which is known in such a way that blood comes out with the urine: then put your finger in the wound, and extract this blood, for if it remains there, it will corrupt the bladder, and rot it; then wash the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and help it in all the ways that you know, until it is healed; and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind his two thighs, and gather the medicines on the spot.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the conduit of the rod [penis], and stuck inside, and the urine cannot come out; treat it with what I said before, that you cut it many times, one is excused from the cut by this treatment.
I have already proven this thus.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be with three angles fixed in a handle:
then take a thread and tie it around the rod below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder; then push the drill into the rod gently, until it comes to the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side; the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the rod.
It is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is healed; and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, tie a thread below the stone and another above, then split the rod right at the stone between the two ties, then extract it out, and untie the tie, and clean the clotted blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
On women's stones (bladder stones)
It rarely happens that stones are formed in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things: one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin; and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will reveal herself to physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third manner is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-versed in this manual art; and the fourth manner is that the stone in the woman is deeper than the stone in the man, therefore it requires making a deeper cut, and there is great fear. And if necessity compels this, you must take a well-knowing female physician, and she is hardly found, and if you don't find one, then seek a chaste clever physician; and present to him a midwife well-versed in women's lives, or a woman who knows part of the art, and command her to do what you command regarding the investigation of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger in the fundament and search for the stone; and if she finds it, she should constrain it under her finger, and recommend that she insert her finger in the patient's vagina, and search and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downward, until it comes to the root of the thigh; then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh against the middle of the vagina, there where it is most apparent, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the cut be small at first; then insert the probe in the cut, if you feel the stone then increase the wound until the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones: that is to say, small and large and rough and smooth, long and round, and which have branches.
Thus know their appearances to know the outcome.
And if blood overcomes you, put ground vitriol on the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stanched; then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about in the extraction of stones in men to help you in your work; and if blood overcomes you, and it's from the artery that is cut, then put the powder on the place and pack it with tents and bandages, and do not start this again, and leave the stone and do not draw it out, for perhaps the patient would die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is calmed, and the place suppurates, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
On fleshy hernia
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture in the white syphac, which is below the covering of the testicles, which contains the egg; and it is called "syphac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the egg, so that one thinks it is another egg; and this is the skin of the testicle between the white syphac that we have mentioned; and this happens only rarely.
And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread out.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: either it is a color declining to yellow, or it is red blood, or black, or watery white, and this happens more often; and these are the signs to recognize this collection, for if it is in the white syphac that we have mentioned, then the swelling is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, for it has moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper membrane, then the swelling is round with a part of the egg, and because of this one thinks that it is another egg; and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white syphac, then one feels it well; therefore when you want to know the color of the moisture, test it with the square probe, whose form is shown before this.
Therefore judge what is inside according to what comes after the probe.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body; then lay him on his back, on something slightly elevated, and put many cloths beneath him; then sit on his left side, and command the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two sides of the heart of the testicles; then take the broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle lengthwise up to near the groin, and let your incision be completely straight while separating the skin of the testicles until the white membrane, and peel it carefully according to your ability; then pierce the membrane full of water with a wide hole, and draw out all the water, and then put your hooks, and extend the membrane upward; and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the membrane; cut all or in pieces especially its subtle side, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return; and if the egg comes out during your work, return it to its place when you have completed the work on the membrane; then join the two lips of the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted by another illness, it is necessary that you tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood; then cut the testicle with all the suspensory, and extract the egg, and treat it as we have said.
And if water is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two hernias; so cut the other part as you did the first equally, then dry the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and put outside other wool soaked in wine and oil, and put it on the two testicles, and put doubled cloths above, and tie it up with the bandage that is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this appearance and let them be joined by sewing in the throat of the breeches, and one of the ends should reach from the fundament to the back, and the other to the part of the groin; and the other two ends on the two angles, and let all the constraint be assembled in the buckle of the truss; and sometimes this hernia is treated with cautery instead of cutting with iron, and it is that you take a subtle knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white membrane that contains the water is uncovered; so take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that membrane with the hooks, and peel it with this subtle hot cautery:
And cut it in all the ways that you can, until you extract everything; and ensure that the fire does not touch the egg; and know that this work is safer; and better guarding against blood flow, and better than the work of cutting; and if anything opposes you, whether hot abscess or blood flow or something else, so treat what opposes you, according to what was said before.
And if the patient is fearful, and does not want to endure this work for its horribleness, so administer perforation, as I tell you, and it is that when you are quite certain by the signs that we have mentioned that it is a watery hernia there, so make the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with the broad spatula, and make the perforation lengthwise of the body; and let the hole be wide, so that all the water runs out; then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and leave for the remainder of the water to run, then treat it until the wound is healed; and if the white cloth does not let the water out at the mouth of the wound, it is necessary that you push in a quill or the instrument with which one draws the water from dropsy patients, of which the form is shown before; and widen the wound a little, and know that the water returns, and is gathered after six months or thereabouts, and when it is gathered as before, and thus will the patient pass his days.
of the abscess of the testicles
Know that in the cutting of this hernia there is fear in several conditions, which is why it seems to me better to leave it; and I will tell you the procedure and the appearances of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses come to the body, and especially to the testicles; and this happens due to many cases.
That is to say by sour and sharp superfluity, which is spread to the testicles, or from percussion; and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and finds no pain, and is a serious abscess; and perchance it is a serious, fearsome and purulent abscess, of dark color, and sometimes comes from an arterial knot, or from swelling of a vein.
When it is from an arterial knot, it is known by the disposition of hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it.
That which is made from swelling of a vein is known by its disposition upon pressing with the fingers, and one can well make the cut on this appearance, and on the other flesh; and it is that you cut the heart of the testicles, then extend the egg upward, and pull it out of the white membrane, and free the suspensory from all parts of the egg.
If the egg is already soldered with these born flesh, then you must pull the egg, and cut it; and if it adheres to the membrane, or in that which is within the vessels, then you must free all that thin part, and cut it roundly.
And if the birth of the flesh is in the back place, then you must cut it all, and extract the egg, as we have said.
And when your work is accomplished, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of the abscess of the testicles
This is an abscess wrapped in a wrapping similar to a bud, with the softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks; and the cure of this disease is nearly as fearsome as the one before, and nevertheless we will tell you the procedure for it, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then push down the suspensory of the testicles with your fingers, with all the vessels that are close to the rod, and the master should hold them, and extend them strongly; then cut with the wide cutting spatula across near the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then skin from each part, as we have said in the extraction of arteries that are in temples; then stick a needle there with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the living tissue has come, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted moisture; then treat the wound as others where pus is generated, so that some vessels fall that nourish one of the testicles; for by this no harm comes, and if to all the vessels comes living tissue, then it is necessary to draw the testicles with all the vessels; so that the egg does not lose its nourishment through the incision of the vessels, and they dry up and cannot help themselves.
of the rupture of the syfac (peritoneum)
This hernia occurs due to a cut that happens in the syfac, or stretching above the belly in the groin area, whereby the intestines descend from this rupture to one of the testicles; and this rupture is either of the syfac, or from its stretching, and these two types come from many causes: either from a blow, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting heavy weights, and similar things; and the signs when it's from the stretching of the syfac, is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and doesn't come suddenly; and the swelling is uniform down to the depths, because the syfac presses on the intestine.
And the signs when it's from a cut in the syfac, is that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the swelling appears irregular, close under the skin, and this is due to the exit of the intestine and the body outside of the syfac.
And sometimes the omentum descends with the intestine, and is retained there, and causes great pain to the patient, especially when it is pressed.
And in these iron (surgical) cures there is fear, which is why they must be avoided.
And the manner of the operation is that you command the patient to return the intestine with his hand inside the wound, if it can re-enter; then he should lie supine on his neck between your hands, and raise his thighs; then stretch the scrotum above, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then push inside the lips of the cut with hooks according to what you need to open the wound, and it should be such that the egg (testicle) can come out; then flay the syfac that is under the skin of the testicles, until the white hard syfac is uncovered on all sides; then push your index finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between the white syfac which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second syfac, and separate what is behind the egg, and between the second syfac; and then move with the right hand inside the scrotum, and stretch the white syfac upward with your left hand, and lift the egg with all the syfac toward the cut; and command the assistant to stretch the egg upward, and untie what is attached behind the binding; and search with your fingers if there is any intestine wrapped in the white hard syfac, and if you find any, push it into the belly below; then take a needle with a thick thread made of 10 threads, and push it into the back part of the syfac, which is near the skin of the testicles; after the cut, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, until there are 4 threads; then gather them one above the other in the form of a cross, and tie the syfac, of which we have spoken which is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong binding of two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them strongly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter them, lest hot swelling come there; and put again the binding according to the first binding two fingers from that one, and after these two bindings leave of the syfac which is under the scrotum the width of a finger; and after all the other according to the roundness that the egg carries; then cut in the part that is under the skin of the testicles, until the blood runs, and the matter, as we have said before; then administer wool soaked in oil, and put in wounds, and administer the binding that we have mentioned.
And sometimes the white syfac that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of blood flow.
For this happens many times, and leave the binding until it falls by itself; and if it is slow to fall, then let it be sprinkled with hot water, and put on what we have mentioned, until it falls; then treat the wound with other treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
On fleshy hernia
In this type of hernia, I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the cure with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the hernia that is near the penis, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after cutting above them lightly below; then cut in the middle, and treat the abscess with what works, until the vessels fall off; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture comes in the groin, as we have said, and the area appears; and none of the intestines descend to the testicles, and if they do descend, it's little, and returns at all hours; and nevertheless if it remains too long in this state, the wound in the peritoneum grows, until the intestine descends; and this happens by the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we have said, for it is stretched, then the area becomes softened and swollen and appears; and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before; and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies supine on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen area of the rupture widthwise according to the width of 3 fingers; and then extract the peritoneum which is under the skin that follows it, then take the probe and put it on the visible area of the peritoneum; and press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two visible areas of the peritoneum above the head of the probe, and sew one and the other; then remove the head of the probe, and do not cut any of the peritoneum nor stretch the egg or anything else, as I have made known to you in the cure of intestinal hernia; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
And when you cut the threads, clean it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The peritoneum is constrained, and has no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is better in this place, and closer to health.
On the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh that is inside is softened, and it is ugly to see; and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one makes the patient lie on his back, and cut the skin that is softened above the natural skin; then bring together the two lips with a suture, and if you want, first sew the excess of the softened skin with 3 or 4 sutures firmly; then cut between the sutures, and treat it like other wounds until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
On castration
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law, and because of this I would prefer not to speak of it in this book; and it is not necessary except for 2 reasons: one of which is that the physician should know how to respond when asked about it, and know its cure; and the other, because we often need castration of some animals to help us, such as billy goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say therefore that castration is done according to 2 methods: either by traction, or by incision.
In that which we do by traction, we make the animal sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand, until they are gone and you no longer feel them.
Of castration by cutting: it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above each egg with one cut, when you have well skinned them; and leave there some small amount of the peritoneum and the subtle peritoneum which is over the vessels; and this manner of castration is better than that which is done by traction, because with traction there perhaps remains something of the testicles, whereby the animal desires luxury; then treat the wound until it is healed.
Of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism exists in two forms in men: one is when between the two testicles appears something like the figure of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows from it.
And the other form is in women, and has above the pubic area something like a penis and two testicles.
And the treatment for both man and woman is that you cut away all the joined flesh, and treat them like other wounds; in the second type, for men whose urine comes out through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Of the clitoris
The clitoris is a flesh joined above the natural part, such that it is very ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the treatment.
It is necessary that you hold the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with hooks, and cut it carefully; and do not go too deep, lest bleeding occur, then treat it with other treatment until it is healed; and another flesh that grows at the mouth of the womb, and fills it, and by chance comes out, and is like a tail in appearance, and for this reason the ancients called it "tail disease."
So it is necessary that you cut it, as we have said for the clitoris, and treat it until it is healed.
Of obstruction
Obstruction is when a woman's nature is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is natural from birth, or accidental from disease that has come there; or it is from joined flesh, or from the thin or thick membrane, and is made deep in the womb, or on the sides, or below, or wherever; and prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps having periods; and the knowledge of this is by the midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is near and visible, probe it with your fingers or with the probe.
If it is from the thin membrane, and it is near the two lips, then hurry, and break it thus: put your two index fingers together, and let the woman lie on her back, with her legs spread; then stretch the two lips strongly, until the thin membrane is broken, and the obstruction is opened; then take wool, and moisten it with oil, and put it on the place, and let the woman lie with a man each day, so that it cannot heal shut.
And if the membrane is hard and thick, it is necessary that you cut it with a spatula shaped like a myrtle leaf.
If the obstruction is from grown flesh, suspend it with the hook and cut it; and have blood-staunching medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, together with egg white; then apply a wide lead tube, so that the wound cannot heal shut; and keep it thus for a long time, and apply a dry linen tent; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And when grown flesh comes in the womb, it must be cut according to this method, unless it is cancerous growths.
For cancerous growths that are in the womb, one should not touch them with iron.
From "On hemorrhoids":
Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when hemorrhoids are old they become thelul [growths]; and we have already spoken in the division about their appearances and signs, and I will speak here of those that receive treatment.
I say that hemorrhoids and thelul, when they are deep in the womb and cannot be felt, are not to be treated with iron [surgical instruments].
Those that are at the mouth of the womb, which can be felt, are those that can be treated.
It is therefore necessary that you put the woman in a cold room, then extend the growth with forceps, and cut it at its roots, then powder it with blood-stopping medicines, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things; then push her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water; and if bleeding occurs, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster of it on her back.
And if it stops, that is good.
If not, then apply cupping glasses to her back and breasts without cutting; then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or in wild rose juice with old wine, and apply it to the place.
And when the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed; and that which is called "albathir" is red, and resembles a rough head, so it must be cut as I said for the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
From "On swellings of the womb":
Many kinds of swellings come in the womb, such as cancer and pus-filled swellings and herpes and gangrene and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot swelling, and several other diseases that I mentioned in the division.
It is therefore necessary that I speak in this treatise of the hot swelling that comes in the womb, which is not one of the swellings that collect pus; and if you want to know the work of iron [surgical procedure], look if the swelling is acute at the beginning of its arrival, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it.
Then do not hurry to pierce it, but let it ripen until the pain is calmed; and then make the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where she reclines, and support her back and bring her feet to the outer parts of the leg; and let her thighs be spread, and put her arms under her knees, and bind them well with a good binding; then let her lie toward the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the womb, of which the form comes hereafter; and it is necessary that when you want to administer this instrument, that you first insert the probe to know the depth of the womb, so that what enters of the instrument doesn't go deeper than it should, and that it doesn't harm the patient; and if the instrument is too large, it is necessary to cover the depth of the womb with cloths, so that the instrument doesn't harm it; and it is necessary that he put the horn of the instrument at the top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the swelling appears, and one feels it soft with the hand, it must be cut at the head, with a broad spatula; and when the pus is emptied, it is necessary that you put in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dry green oil; and put the tent outside the wound at the depth of the womb, and put outside on the womb and on the groin clean wool soaked in water where mallows have been cooked; then treat it after 2 days with suitable ointment for this, until it is healed; and sometimes one washes the womb and the wound with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water where lily roots and long aristolochia have been cooked; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is hidden in the womb, it is necessary that you avoid cauterizing with iron, but treat it as we have said in the division.
on childbirth
First, it is necessary for the midwife to recognize the natural position of childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing down, and desiring to breathe air: then the child hastens to come out; then know that this birthing is according to the natural position, and the exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it; and when you see these signs, it is necessary to press gently on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly; for when it descends head first, the afterbirth comes with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good cleansing; and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For sometimes it comes feet first, and the body or the head comes out, and the hands, or it comes on its belly, or supine, and is turned perhaps on its neck, and by other bad positions; thus it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in these things, and to beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one must help.
If the child comes head first by natural exit, and the woman labors with difficulty, and her strength is weak, make her sit on a chair, where the women hold her; and sprinkle her nature with oil where fenugreek has been cooked, and then the midwife puts between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the form:
and split the afterbirth, and cut with her nail until the moisture that is inside runs out; and press the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it doesn't descend, it is necessary to give the woman an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil; then make her push and sneeze from condisi, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, it is necessary that you return them gently little by little; and if they cannot enter, put the woman on a seat, and raise her feet high; then push the seat to the ground, and hold the woman, that she doesn't fall in the pushing; and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, cut off the hands with the knife which is shown before, and extract the child, and bring it back evenly.
on the exit of the child feet first
When the child comes feet first, it is necessary to push it up; and then turn it little by little, until it is straight; then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it comes up to the thighs, command her to push, and make her sneeze from condisi; it will come out, if God wills.
And if it doesn't come out as we have said, turn it little by little, until it is according to the natural position.
For then it comes out easily.
And if it doesn't come out as we have said, take marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and melted gum, and grind all in a mortar; and put this ointment on the woman's nature inside and outside, then make her sit in tepid water up to below the ribs; and when she is softened below, make her a pessary of myrrh, and put it below, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and hold her mouth and nose, and press her belly gently, for the child will come out immediately.
on the exit of the child on its knees
When the child comes in this form, let the midwife put her hands in little by little; then let her be laid back on her neck, and her feet hang down, and be lying on a bed; and fold her hands little by little, and then press the hands on the belly, and remove the cushions from below, until she is positioned downward; and if the child doesn't come out, take its feet and move them strongly, then move the belly upward, then push your hands in; and move the child little by little; and command the woman to push until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child who comes with one hand hanging down
It is necessary to devise a way to return the hand: if one cannot return it, make the woman get up and walk; if she cannot walk, make her lie on a bed, and push her legs firmly; then administer the mucilage that I have described; and if she does not deliver, make her sit on a seat, then work to return the hand; and deliver the child according to the natural position, and make her sneeze, and command her to push until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child on its neck, with its hands spread out, and its face turned toward its mother's back
It is necessary that the midwife hold her hand, then turn it little by little, and deliver it gently; and when it is aligned, put on the birth canal mucilage of althaea and oil, as we have said, then command her to move little by little; and when you have done this, make her sit on a seat, and command her to push; and make her sneeze.
of this same manner with the afterbirth
When it comes out in this manner with the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your nail, until the moisture is emptied; and if the child hangs on its face and on its neck, cut it from the navel, so that it is not retained, and the child dies; then push the child inside, until you have put it as it should be, and command the woman to push sometimes: then it will come out easily.
of the delivery of twins
Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, though it happens rarely.
Two is a strange thing, and they do not live except rarely; I know this, that they are multiplied, and are separated by the peritoneum which divides them, which is connected to the navel; and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single one, as we have said.
And if they come out with difficulty, treat her as we have said, and let the midwife be subtle, and do quickly and lightly what she does; and do thus as it is better for safety.
of multiple children
Sometimes there are formed in the womb 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7, or more up to 15, and they are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the glorious sage, and it is necessary that the midwife know all this, for by chance similar things happen to her; so let her do according to what is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in the womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to work with hands; you must know if the woman is of sound strength, and has no condition where she fears death; the woman must lie on her back, and her head be inclined downward, and the legs raised; and the attendant should hold her from two sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child; then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mucilage of marshmallow and fenugreek and linseed, then the midwife should anoint her hands with these oils and these mucilages; then insert them gently into the womb, then seek a place where she can insert the hooks that are suitable for this, and take care if the child is positioned to descend head-first; then fix the hooks in its eyes or in its neck or in its mouth or in its palate or under the chin or in the chest or near the ribs, and if the descent is feet-first, fix them in the groin and at the middle ribs; and she must hold the hook with her right hand, and put the curve between the fingers of her left hand, and insert it all with her hand gently, and fix the hook in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it comes to the empty space; and this is the form of the hook:
then fix against it another hook, or a third if you need it, so that the extraction is equal; and then pull equally while moving from one side to the other, to better extract it, and let the hooks be toothed to better hold, as shown in this form:
And if a part remains, the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and pull the other part; and if any remains, put this hook in the highest place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and it cannot be brought back due to the constriction, you must wrap it in a cloth, until it comes out completely; then cut it at the joint of the palm or at the elbow, and thus you must do the same with the other hand, and with both feet.
And if the child's head is large and it is narrow at the exit, or if there is water gathered in the head, you must insert the thorny spatula between your fingers, and split the head and extract the water; or you break it with the instrument called "almidach," whose form comes with the instruments in the chapter after this one; and likewise do the same if the child has a naturally large head; and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head comes out and it is constricted at the chest, let it be split, until the moisture that is in the chest comes out; and if it cannot come out, cut it in pieces as best you can; and if it is swollen in the belly or below the ribs, you must pierce it until the moisture runs out.
And if the child is feet-first, the pulling is easy, and the alignment with the mouth of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow at the belly or at the chest, you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and split the belly or the chest, until the moisture that is there runs out; and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, the midwife should insert her hand deep into the womb, and pull it to the mouth of the womb; then insert one or two hooks, and pull it out; and if the mouth of the womb is contracted due to hot swelling that has come there, one must not work at it, but rather administer moist and fatty substances; and administer plasters, and let her sit in mollifying and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can position it evenly, administer what we have said for the living child; and if one does not have the power, pull it out in pieces, and do not leave any of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, administer to her what we have said about hot abscesses that come in the womb; and if bleeding occurs, let her be put in restraining water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then she conceived another on top of that one, and the other one died too.
After a long time, an abscess appeared in her belly, and swelled so much that it opened, and began to produce much pus.
I was called to treat it, and I tended to it for a long time, and the wound could not heal.
I put on a strongly drawing plaster, and a bone came out, and after some days another one.
I was very surprised, because there are no bones in the belly.
So I thought that these were the bones of a dead child.
I examined the wound, and drew out many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time thus, and a little pus always came from the place; and I have recorded this chapter only so that, when the master finds a strange thing, he knows how to provide help.
about returning the womb to its place
Here follows the form of the presser, with which one opens the passages; and it has two turning points at the two ends of the two bands.
However, the horns should be more delicate than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood; and the mouth of the wood should be one finger wide, and the margin of the trees one finger, and one and a half palms long; and in the middle of the two bands should be two joints of this same wood, which should be fixed in one and the other, half a palm long or a little more; and these two joints are pushed into the mouth of the womb to open it when one turns the two horns.
Another form, in its likeness more delicate and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, in the likeness of tongs; and should have at the two ends two joints, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide; and when you want to open the womb with the instrument, make the woman sit on a bed, feet hanging and legs open, then push the two joined joints together into the womb, and hold the head of the instrument below between her thighs; then open your hand with the instrument, as you did with the tongs equally, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
These instruments are all superior, and their forms are multiplied; and when the physician has them prepared, the work is more swift, and more noble to men for their quantity.
Do not despise the instrument that you have not prepared, for their necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, you must command the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with condisi, and press your hands to her mouth and nose; and if it comes out with this, good.
If not, take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia lignea and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be cooked in the pot in water over the fire; then put a reed in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb, and hold it until the vapors come inside the womb; then make her sneeze, as we have said.
The afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, command the midwife to wet her left hand in sesame oil or in marshmallow mucilage, and then push it into the birth canal, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, let her take it and extend it little by little straight, so that the womb does not fall with the extraction; but it must be moved gently to the right and to the left, and then pull; thus it will come and detach itself.
And if the opening of the womb is already narrowed, we have spoken of the cure of sneezing, and of fumigation with herbs; and if it doesn't come out with all that we have said, be careful not to be foolish in pulling; but it is necessary that what is at the opening of the womb, that you tie it to the woman's thigh, then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment; it will rot and reset, and will come out; but nevertheless, when it rots there comes a bad odor to the stomach and head, and hurts the patient.
Therefore suitable fumigations are needed for this: some of the ancients have tested fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for retained menses and afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass resembling a cane, and one puts the thin end in the privates, and the wide ends over the fire; and let the fumigations be over the coals, and keep it until it is spent, and begin another.
On piercing the anus
Many children are born who do not have the anus pierced, but rather it is stopped by a thin membrane: so it is necessary for the midwife to pierce this membrane with her finger, and not to pierce it with a sharp spatula, and to be careful of tearing that she doesn't touch it; then put wool soaked in wine and oil on it, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you fear it might close again, put a lead tube in the opening, and leave it many days, and let it be removed when the child needs to go to the chambers.
And sometimes this blockage comes from the healing of a wound or abscess; so it is necessary to cut this healing: let it be treated, as we have said, with the lead tube.
On fistula of the anus
Fistulas that come below the anus are nodules, and swellings that come beside the anus outside, or in the space of the two parts, thus having one fistula or several; and when this nodule is old, it opens, and runs with watery white moisture or thin pus, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating; and are known by this that there comes out either excrement or wind when the patient defecates, and by chance a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce through to the bladder, and to the middle of the penis; and reach to the joint of the thigh, and to the knot of the tail.
And thus one knows the penetrating fistula to the anus, and not penetrating: it is that you put your index finger in the anus, and push a thin needle of brass or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, push in a thin lead probe, or a horse hair, until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger; and if you don't feel it, and there comes no excrement from the opening nor wind nor worm, as we have said: know that it does not penetrate; so hasten to cure it.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urinary tract, urine leaks out, and cannot be healed by medicines.
If it is pierced to the joint of the thigh, the probe comes to that place; if there is no tortuosity and the finding of pain around, it is that pus always comes out, and medicine is of no use nor healing by ointment; and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure except labor, and vanity of foolish physicians who meddle with it.
In that which is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of health by iron, as I have tested, and it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back; and lift his legs up onto his thighs, and have his thighs inclined to his belly; then push a brass or lead probe if there is tortuosity, until you know where the probe comes to.
If the patient feels it around the anus, it is necessary that you put your index finger in, if you then feel that the probe has pierced it; and let it be uncovered where you feel between your finger the membrane or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; so do not work at it for it cannot be healed.
One says however that some can be well healed, but this happens rarely; and the help that one provides is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously stated; and pushes it all hot into the fistula, until it comes near the fundament; and does this 2 or 3 times, until you know that these matted flesh parts, which resemble a bird's feather, are burned; and then treat it with tents soaked in butter, until that flesh comes out, then treat it with ointment generating flesh and binding.
If it is thus healed, that is good.
If not, it cannot be healed otherwise; and if the tent enters, and does not pierce through to the finger which is in the fundament, and there is between your finger and the tent a thick covering of flesh or membrane, and you see the fistula to that which follows the covering of the skin; then cut from the beginning of the fistula, and keep pushing forward the tent, and then the cautery after, until it comes to the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and fall; then clean those matted flesh parts that resemble a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and runs between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
For the cautery of fire combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of these joined flesh parts, and the stanching of blood and the drying of moisture; then treat it with tents soaked in butter or in crushed cabbage, until the place discharges pus, and the burned flesh comes out in the pus; then treat the wound with binding ointments generating hard flesh, and these are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if the fistula comes up to the depth of the fundament, and is far from the body, then put your finger in the fundament, and investigate this.
If you feel the tent, and between the two is the membrane or the tissue or flesh, or it is close to piercing, then there is nothing but a way of trust and hope, through the administration of one of three ways: either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can put tents and treat as before; and do not go too deep, lest you cut the tendon that holds the fundament, and excrement comes there without will; then treat it, as we have said; by chance it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it is cut near the fundament, either by tent or by another pointed instrument; then clean that matted flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then study to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament: it will be an easier thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are according to this manner: and it is when you push the tent into the fistula, and it is on the side of the fundament near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the head according to this form:
And push a twisted thread in two, and push the tent with all the thread into the fistula until it is at the head.
If it is piercing into the margin of the fundament within, then pull the thread from that hole, so that you put your finger in the fundament; and pull the head of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and tighten one to the other, and leave it for a day or two; and tighten it sometimes, until the thread cuts these flesh parts that are between two, and they fall; then treat the wound until it is bound and healed.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in all the ways that you can, if it is not too deep.
For it is not necessary to make for the lacing cut so deep, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The form of the spiny spatula with which one splits the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and not on the other side, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
On hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the fundament, like grape seeds, and there are small and large ones, and blood flows from them, and there can be one or several, and they are outside the fundament and at the head of the fundament; but those that are outside have little moisture, and there flows either a bit of citrine water or a bit of blood, and they have the color of the body; and the cure for those who have them inside the fundament is that you command the patient to strain to go to the chambers, until the fundament comes out, and the threads appear; then hurry, and grab them with pincers, or hold them with your nail, then cut them at their roots; and if the hook cannot hold them because of their moisture, then take them with a cloth, or with cotton, or with a piece of camlet; and pull them with your fingers, then cut them, and powder them with some hot powders that act as cautery; or cauterize them as said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other cures until healed; and if the fundament cannot come out, then give the patient an enema that is biting and harsh to wash what is in the fundament, so that it can come out openly; when the patient strains, and if the threads are outside the fundament, then the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your nail or with pincers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until healed, and that he fears the incision by iron.
Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture in this manner: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread above and make the needle pierce through the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide; and tighten the thread strongly, then tie the thread, and pull out the needle, and do this with all the others, and leave one for the superfluity of blood to flow; then put on the fundament a cloth moistened in rose oil or in cerate, and put it on the fundament, and command the patient to rest; and then leave it until they fall, and when they have fallen, treat them with ointment and other cure, until healed.
On the drying of feces in the fundament
Many times drying of feces occurs in the intestine, and by constraint of nature, and when the malady is old and medicine is of no use.
Thus it is necessary that you scrape with the point of a spatula or with your nail the crust above, which does not let it moisten; then treat it until it is sealed as necessary; and if it cannot seal, then begin the scraping stronger than before, until it bleeds much, and becomes scraped; then treat it until it is healed.
On the ant-bite
Formica is a small felted appearance around the body, and goes very deep; and sometimes the cold finds it, and one feels it like an ant bite, and it comes in all the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and put this quill on the ant-bite, until the circle encompasses the ant-bite all around; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the ant-bite, and put it deep, and pull out the ant-bite from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron tube according to this form, and let it be thin below and pulling above:
not pierced, to better hold with the finger, and better press. And if you wish, cauterize the ant-bite, as it is said before in the chapter on cautery.
On the form of the enema
Sometimes one makes an enema of silver or brass, or of melted or hammered brass; and sometimes one makes these instruments small and large, according to those to whom they are administered.
Those therefore that one administers in the cure of children and who are weak and in pain, are small.
The form of the small and large enema is wide above, where the belly is bound in this manner:
And there should be a separation where the belly is bound, as you see, and the head should be pierced within; and it should have on one of the sides 2 holes, and on the other 1; and the belly where one puts the medicines should be made of an animal bladder or parchment, and should be pierced all around with small holes, and there should be between each hole 1 finger's width of space, then push into these holes a strong thread of raw twisted thread in 10 or thereabouts, and assemble the belly like a goat's; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then give the enema; and this is the form of the circle:
And the medicine should be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or similar thing, then push it in gently; then the minister should squeeze it with his two hands together, until it is completely empty, then withdraw the clyster, and the patient should raise his legs against the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, he should hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps a night with it all, it is of greater help.
And if you give him an enema in illness of running belly, and the medicine hastens to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids in the fundament, or abscess, the clyster should be as thin as for a child; and this is the form of the thin clyster on which the skin should be tightened:
Of wounds
We have already spoken in the division about the cure of wounds; now we will tell you the cures by hand and medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are different according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and by what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing of stone, and cut of sword and knife, or of lance or of wood or of arrow, or of similar things; or that are made according to the places of the body, such as wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members; and I will tell you the cure for each wound, and will begin with simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, observe if it is from throwing of stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rising of hot abscess: so have him bled immediately from the cephalic vein especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and let the patient avoid repletion of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, then let his food be reduced, and let him not drink wine, nor eat meat; and put on the wound, if hot abscess comes there, cotton soaked in rose oil only, or in styptic wine; and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not changed by the air, powder, which I will tell about a little later; and if the air has changed it, put on it some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large such as from sword cut and similar things, and the lips cannot be joined by tents, then join them by suture, as I will tell about wounds of the belly, about the suture.
If the wound is uncovered of bone, and hanging, and holds only by a little, then cut it; then cure the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and command the patient to eat heavy foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, like porridge, and similar things.
And if you find rottenness in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the rottenness, and throw it out, then cure it; and if there is artery in the wound or vein, from which blood runs, and it cannot be stanched by medicines, then seek the artery, and if you find it untied, tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, then the cure is easy: and it is that you put in this powder which seals before the air has changed it.
And here is the manner of the powder: take one part frankincense; two parts dragon's blood; three parts quicklime, and powder it finely, and fill the wound, and bind it strongly, until it adheres well and joins with all its blood; and then bind it well, and leave it without unbinding, unless it swells; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with lime only, when one has neither frankincense nor dragon's blood, but only if the burning has not changed the wound.
And if the burning has changed the wound, especially in summer, one does not put this powder on it; but puts on some digestive ointments, or powder of barley flour made with water and honey, until it discharges pus; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if bone fracture comes with the wound, and it is small, extract it with fine pincers; and I will tell you hereafter about fractures of the head.
Of the wound of the neck
If a wound comes to the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other solution than to leave the treatment, and put nothing constrictive on it, for it harms the nerves and makes them retract; and put nothing cold on the wound, for the substance of nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member; but let the medicine be gentle, such as lime washed in fresh water, and mixed with rose oil, and chalk washed also in fresh water, and other mineral stones according to this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is hollow and full of pus, pierce it at the lowest place; and if the artery is cut, and blood flow comes from it, separate it, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary; and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the flesh, and the conduit is preserved, through which the food goes, sew the flesh over the windpipe, and do not touch the throat but put it back according to its natural shape; and then bind it properly, and leave it some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed; and if the wound has made an impression in the bone, search it; and if there are pieces of bone, pull them out all if you can, and those that you cannot have, leave until the wound rots, and the exit is separated and eased; and if the wound is fresh, powder it with the powder that I have mentioned.
And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
Of the wound of lance or knife
If it is a blow from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, observe if air comes out of the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal; and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put the powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it because of the blood that might remain deep inside, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but put attractive ointment on it, and bind it twice a day; and if you have no ointment, put old cotton in the wound to draw out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for 3 days, or 4, or more; thus neither spasm, nor bad tremor of the heart nor tightness of breath will come; and when you see good dispositions, know that the wound is safe.
Treat it then with tents and other treatments, until it is healed; and if it cannot heal, and opens, know then that there is a fistula; treat it as one should.
And if the wound is from a cut of sword or knife, and it is simple, on the chest or on the back, treat it with what is mentioned before; if it is large, with suturing; and if it is small, with powder, and if it is impressed in the bone, and has cut pieces, search the wound, and pull them out if they are separated; and if they are not separated, let the wound rot, so extraction will be easier; and for other wounds to other members the judgment is as we have said.
On the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large, medium and small; from the large wound sometimes emerge the intestines, or the membranes of the intestines, which causes their protrusion; and the suturing is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because one has more difficulty putting the intestines back in if one doesn't put them back in while they're warm; because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, they go back in with more difficulty, and therefore the medium wound is better, because one returns the intestine to its place better than in the other two cases. And know that the rupture of the belly is of four types: the two common sutures occur in the suturing of the belly, and the suturing of other wounds of the body and two other specific sutures are common to other wounds; and yet they are more specific to the suturing of the belly, and I will describe and explain each one.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put back, this is due to one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this way: wet a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or you cook in water schoenanth and cypress and spikenard, and moisten the intestine until the swelling is removed; and sometimes astringent wine does this, and it is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling going down, moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow and mallow have been cooked, for this eases the entry with little effort; and if it cannot enter, make a small incision with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids; and the first treatment is better than cutting, as one should not cut without great necessity; and this is the instrument for the incision: it cuts on the inside of the curve and not on the outside, and here is its form:
And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine comes out, put it back according to its natural form in its proper place, if you are able to do so, for this is better.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, it is necessary that you have the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the part below the belly, put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and likewise if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two sides, focus on making the wounded part higher than the other; and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
For small wounds put what you have prepared, then have between your hands a careful assistant who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together; and this is the common manner of sutures, and it is that you take one needle or several, according to the size of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound a finger's space, and stick in it a needle with a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the siphac, which is under the skin inside, until you make it pierce from that part, and bring together the two ends of the siphac all four together; then tighten it with a double thread around the needle from both sides, then bring the two ends of the wound together properly, and then leave a finger's space, and stick another needle in it; then tie it with thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to what you need of needles, until the whole wound is closed; and let the needles be medium, between thin and thick, for thin needles cut all the flesh, and the too thick ones cannot enter well: therefore they must be medium; and one must not push the needles too far outside the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before healing; and then cut the ends of the needles, so they do not hurt the patient while sleeping, and put tents or small cloths at the ends of the needles to hold better, and leave them until the wound is healed; and this manner of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one needle or two suffices. The second suture is common, and it is that you bring together the two ends of the skin and the two ends of the siphac together with a needle that has a strong medium thread; and when you have pierced these four ends together, bring back the needle to the part where you began, in the manner that one sews clothes; and put between each suture the width of a little finger; this suture men know, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, who was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm in size, and intestines came out well two palms in size, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been outside for 24 hours, and the wound was healed within 15 days, and I treated him, and he was cured.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and it was a miracle; and I did not treat him with ointment, for I was in a place where none could be found, nor any medicines; and I put nothing but old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper manners of suturing: take the needle, and push it from the outside part to the inside; when it has pierced the skin straight through, leave the end of the siphac on the side where you pushed the needle, and make it pierce from the other side from the inside part to the outside; and the understanding of this suture is that you sew as the furriers do the skins, and that you leave once the siphac on one side, and take it up again from the other, until the suture is all complete.
The second manner of suture, which Galen properly says, is as some do, who bring the two parts together naturally, and apply one of the ends of the siphac to the other end, in this manner: stick a needle in the end of the nearby mirach, and make it pierce that place only, and leave the two ends of the siphac; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside part to the inside, at the two ends of the siphac; then make it pierce one and the other from the outside part to the inside, at two other ends of the mirach that are on the other side; and this is the better manner of suture and the most common.
Galen said these words, and some witness it, that one must sew the belly with 2 needles, with thread in each; and one must push one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps; and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the suture is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds: and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the air has changed it, put back the intestine, and sew it; then put on the powder that generates flesh, and if the air has changed it, put on some ointment that is present, until the wound suppurates; and the threads fall out, and the sifac and mirach are sealed; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed; and if you don't have medicines, put on, as soon as it starts to suppurate, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you have no need of other medicine in many conditions when the wounds are simple; and if you fear that the wound might communicate with the principal members, you must moisten light wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and put it around the groins, and under the armpits; and if he feels pain or corruption in the bowels, and this happens many times, then give him an enema of warm black wine, especially if the corruption reaches the intestine; and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and its nearness in nature to nerves.
And if the omentum protrudes from the wound, put it back like the intestine, while it is fresh; and if it is old and has become green or black, you must tie the place that is black, so that blood flow doesn't come there, for there are veins and arteries; then cut what is between the binding, and put the two hanging ends from the part below the wound to the outside to facilitate extraction when the omentum falls and the wound suppurates.
On rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is torn, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly with a lance; and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and became old and turned into a fistula, and excrement and winds came out of it; I treated it as best I could, and did not cease to work carefully until it was healed, and the place sealed.
And when I saw it seal, I feared that the patient might have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking; and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it must be tied in this way: take ants with large heads, then bring together the lips of the wound, and when the ant has opened its mouth, put it on the two lips, so that it tightens its mouth on them; and then cut off its head, and this holds so that it cannot come undone, then put another ant after in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely covered; and sew the wound.
These heads stick to the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a subtle thread that is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this way: take the end of this intestinal thread that is very well cleaned of flesh, and then tie to the end of this thread a thin twisted linen thread, then push the thread into the needle, and sew the intestine, and bring it back into the rupture; and this manner of sewing with ants is only according to the way of trust and hope; and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no skill or health, except subtlety.
of fistula wherever it may be
Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes old, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it is hollow and discharges pus.
And fistula is in truth a hardened and white felt-like nodule, where one feels no pain, and it is hollow like a bird's feather; and sometimes clear pus comes out of it, and other times thick; sometimes little, and other times much; and I have already spoken of it in the section on wounds, that every wound that is not healed, and has no flesh, is only due to one of IX causes: namely, due to the scarcity of blood in the body; or due to its poor quality; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, which doesn't allow flesh to grow; or there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good for the cure; or because the corruption is a type of pestilence; or because of the property of the region the digestion is slow, and healing is slow, and swollen by nature; or there are veins or bones: and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the medical cures in the section.
Now I must make known to you the cure of fistula that is done by hand operation.
Know that fistula occurs in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the great veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and there are such that come to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor and ignorance; and if there is any fistula that does not come up to the place that I have said, and you have confidence in the cure, and you want to know it, then take a probe of brass or iron, if the fistula is straight, examine it; and if the fistula is twisted, examine it with a subtle probe of lead, for lead bends better around the tortuosity; and if the fistula has many holes and you cannot examine it well with probes, then cleanse it with an enema through one of the holes, for the moisture runs from one hole to another, and cleanses it; then examine it wisely to your ability, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and if it is hollow in depth, and ask well of the patient about the pain that he feels when you press with your hand, and the place where he feels it; and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it as I have told you, and remove the felt-like material and the corrupted flesh that are inside; and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep straight down, then you must cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in probes moistened in sharp medicine, and push them to the head of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the superfluity that remains at the bottom; and then put in ointments generating healthy flesh, until it is healed; and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If vein or nerves do not hinder you or principal members, as we have said; and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then scrape it until all corruption is removed, then treat it with things generating flesh until it is healed; and if it is not healed, and discharges pus as before, know that you have not gone to the bottom: so uncover and examine until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place; and if it is thus healed, that is good.
If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; there is no other solution than to leave it to nature; and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can extract it with pincers, extract it with an instrument suitable for this, and if there are many bones, extract them all, do not leave a single one; and if moisture hinders you, and there is no risk or fear, cut both moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them in one go, put something on the wound that generates rot, and leave it until the area around the bones is rotten, and then the bones will come out more easily; and if it is a large bone, like from the leg or thigh, scrape only the corruption until all the blackness is removed, then restore the wound; and if there is a large portion of corruption, and it reaches to the bone marrow; it must be sawed and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed; and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example and help in your work.
There was a young man around 30 years old, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, until the matter came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and had no external cause to open; but the physicians in their folly operated on it until the abscess opened, and much matter ran out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared that all discharged pus and moisture from the body; and many physicians treated it for about 2 years, and there was no one skilled in manual arts, until I was called, and saw his leg and the medicines with which they were treating it, and what was running from the holes in great quantity; and the young man's body became red, and had a citrine color.
I inserted a probe into one of these holes, and then examined all the holes, and found that they connected with each other from all parts of the leg.
I then hastened, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted and pierced, and the corruption went to the bone inside; I sawed what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought there was no other corruption, except what I removed; and I began to restore the wound with healing medicines for a long time, and it could not heal; and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I sawed it, and then removed it, and struggled to heal the area; but I could not until I cut about a palm's length of the bone, and drew it out with all its marrow, then restored it with medicines; and it was healed and joined quickly, and there was no need to restart the work except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure it, and for the fear of death that I had for him.
For due to the evacuation he often hiccupped, but he was healed entirely, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and he was in good condition and had no harm or adverse effects whatsoever, neither in coming nor going.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it must be sawed in this manner: take a band, and tie it at the head of the bone that appears, and command someone to pull it upward; and put another band of wool thicker than the first band, and tie it above the flesh that is above the bone, and pull the end, so that you draw the corrupted flesh below, and uncover the flesh above the place where you want to saw, so that the saw does not harm the flesh; and put a brand or a board under the bone to better cut the corrupted flesh; and one must saw as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and saw again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and it's not apparent, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, uncover all the flesh; then put a brand underneath, and then saw from one part to the other the corruption, and let the sawing be along the length of the corruption a little, as we have said; and if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it connects to the other part; and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other device than cutting; and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, this thing is very difficult, but nevertheless you must investigate this corrosion, how it appears to you; and clean it in all the ways that you can, but ensure that the vein or nerve don't oppose you; and know that the incisors and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and their fineness, and their size and their smallness, and their hardness; and for this it is necessary to prepare for each type of operation its instrument; and know that the work will show you the instrument that you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the types of diseases; so consider the instrument that you need according to what is required.
of the fire
The heads rot either from an internal cause, or from an external cause; and when you will have treated this corrosion with the cure of medicines, and they do not help, it is necessary to cut this limb up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes through this from death, or from the malice, which is greater, of the loss of the limb; and the sign is that the limb becomes black, so that it seems that it was burned by fire, and rots after the blackness, then this corrosion goes from limb to limb, and takes over the whole body; so hurry to cut, and if it is from the strike of some venomous beasts, such as sea scorpion and viper and similar, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it, and do not give it space to come to the hand.
And if it comes to the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion doesn't come to the arm; and if it comes to the arm, cut it at the elbow; and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no treatment is worth anything except the quantity of its virtue; and do exactly the same when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint; and if it comes to the foot, cut the whole foot; and if it rises to the leg, cut at the joint of the knee; and if it comes above the knee, there is no other device than to leave the patient to death; and the manner of cutting or sawing the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant extends one of the ties downward, and another assistant the other tie upward, and you separate the flesh that is between the two ties with a wide spatula, until the bone is uncovered; then cut or saw it, and put on each side a linen cloth, so that the saw doesn't touch the healthy place, and another hot lesion and abscess comes to the patient.
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some styptic powders; then return to your medicine until it is complete, then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it heals; and I will tell you what happened to a man in his foot: he developed a blackness that looked like a burn from fire, and this corrosion first came to his toe, until it spread throughout the foot; and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off the foot, and was healed; and long time after the corrosion returned in his finger, and he came to me, and I applied repercussive things after purifying the body, and the corrosion could not be stopped; and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, as I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also feared that if I cut his hand, he might die, for the man's strength was weak; and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed; and I have only told this so that others might do the same, if they have need.
Sometimes an abscess comes in a fleshy place, and remains so long that it makes a great collection of pus; and then breaks and pierces, and the pus comes out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin above is as thin as a fine cloth, and does not corrupt down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such illness is called a "sinus", and is not called a "fistula"; but if it is so extended that it reaches down to the bone in depth, it is called a "fistula"; and the treatment is that you cut this skin all around, especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not adhere because of its corruption.
And if you have confidence that the skin will adhere, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with a clyster thus: observe if the sinus is large, and the pus that comes out has a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put to cook in a vessel on the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey; and then take of this according to your need, and melt it in water and honey, and clysterize the sinus, and constrict the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then draw it out by squeezing; do this many times, until the sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed; and sometimes it is clysterized with ash-water, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over, then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the sinus is well cleansed; and if the patient cannot bear it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash-water, then clysterize it with water and honey in which there is a little ground litharge; or clysterize it with honey and wine mixed, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine makes the sinus adhere; and when you have done this, and you have confidence that the sinus is well cleansed, then clysterize it with that which makes flesh grow in it, and it is that you take diaphoenicon plaster, and melt it with rose oil and wine; or clysterize it with some medicines and ointments, of which I have spoken of the properties in the treatise on ointments; and if the opening of the sinus is small, and the clyster pipe cannot enter, then enlarge it with an iron a little, and put in a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged; and if the wound is too wide, then sew it and leave only a place where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is above, cut it at the lowest point that there is.
For when pus is deep, it prevents flesh from generating; and if you cannot cut the breast below as you wish, then prepare it in such a way that the pus flows to the lowest point there is, for when the pus is deep, it prevents flesh from generating and if you cannot cut the breast below as you wish, then prepare it in this way: so that the pus flows easily downward, and leave none of the pus; and take consolidative medicines to put on the breast, and spread on it a linen cloth that covers the whole breast; then cut with scissors around the opening of the breast a little wider than before, then spread gentle ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it on the opening of the breast to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days once; and the one that is on the opening of the breast, remove often to remove the pus, and know what will flow of the pus, if it is poison or little or much, or digested, or undigested; and take note if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is swelling or not, and when your medicine is spread in such a way and you see the nature that jumps on the opening of the breast, know that the breast is already healing, and health approaches; and then unbind it in the morning, or the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if the breast discharges undigested pus after many days, know that the breast is not healing.
And if subtle poison flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health approaches.
For there are men whose flesh generation in their wounds is slow, and those who do the contrary; and if undigested pus comes out of the breast after many days, know that the breast is not healing; and if the breast is slow to heal, and is prolonged, then add drying medicines moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as diafinicon ointment, for it has a great part of vitriol, and this is the last medicine; take diafinicon ointment, and melt it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with old wine equal in substance; then prepare it and use it; and this same does better cooked thickened, when diafinicon ointment is not present, or take myrrh and aloe and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey when it is on the fire; and then glue a cloth, and spread it on the breast, and sometimes one administers long aristolochia, and roots of celestial lily, which is like vetch flour and centaury; and use them simple or compound: grind them, and make powder, and put on the honey that I mentioned, and use it; and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression in the bone, or in hard members, or in ligaments; so cure it with the cure of fistula, as we have said before.
Of the abscess of the nail
A whitlow is an abscess that grows beneath the nail of the thumb of the hand, or of the foot, or perhaps grows in other fingers; and when it is old, and one does not take care of it, a hot abscess comes there, and corrupts and discharges pus until it corrupts the root of the nail, and perhaps corrupts it entirely; and the corruption comes up to the bone, until there comes a foul pain, and the head of the finger is wide, and the color is dark.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not profit at all, it is necessary that you cut with an iron all the superfluity that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards.
Cauterization is a very great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy; and if the nail presses the flesh inwards, and begins to prick it, and wounds it, it is necessary that you put the blade beneath the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it upwards, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and put upon the remaining flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove everything; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it, and draw it out, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal; and if you see the finger corrupt, cut it at one of the joints as it is said before, then treat it until it is healed; and if it is struck, and pushed, and it feels great pain, it is necessary that you bleed it first; then cut the nail with a sharp spatula cutting across above, and watch that the cut does not come to the flesh that is beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too great pain; and if it happens, put something on it that soothes.
The pain of the extra finger of the hand
The additional finger that grows in hands of some men by chance is all fleshy, and perhaps there are some where there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow in the root of the joint, or the growth is in some joints of the fingers.
That which grows in some joint of the finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves; the cutting of that which is fleshy is thus easy, in this manner: cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
That which grows in the root of the joint is difficult to cure: so refrain from cutting.
In that which grows on the finger at the last joint, it is necessary that you cut first the flesh roundly up to the bone, then cut the bone with a saw suitable for this, then treat it until it is healed.
The joining that comes to fingers together comes by birth, or by joining of a wound, or by burning of fire, or by similar things.
It is necessary that you cut this joining, so that the fingers return according to their natural forms; then put between two tents or cloths moistened in rose oil, so that they do not join; or put between two pieces of thin lead, until the place is healed, as is necessary.
If joining comes to any of these fingers with the palm, cut this joining as is necessary.
Of the veins
Veins are thick wrapped vessels full of melancholic superfluities, that come in several members of the body; and occurs more in legs of those who go on foot and who work and carry, than in others.
It is necessary therefore that you administer sometimes purgation of bile, and then bleed from the basilic vein.
The iron cure is according to two manners: one is that one cuts them, and draws out the black blood; and the other manner is that you lift the vein, and draw it all out.
The incision is done in this manner: first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick blood becomes thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to below the knee; then cut the vein in one place, or in two or three places, with a wide incision, then lift and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear; and then bind it, and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and restart the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The elevation of it is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if there is much hair, then put him in the bath, and bathe the leg with hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell; and if you don't have a bath, heat it by the fire, and then cut along the vein lengthwise at the top of the knee, or in the part below at the ankle; then open the skin with the hook, and separate the vein on each side until it appears when one feels it; and one sees it red and black, and when it enters the skin it appears like a white cord; then push the probe underneath until it is raised from the skin, and then hang it on the small hook, then cut it in another place three fingers away; then separate the skin above the vein until it appears, then lift it with the probe as you did before, and hang it on another hook, as you did first; then make another cut, or several if you need them, then lift it and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it up to the second cut; then pull it from cut to cut until it all comes out, then cut it; and if you cannot pull and lift it, push a needle with a strong double thread through it, and tie it and pull it, and push a probe underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other until it comes out; and be careful that it doesn't break, for if it breaks, one cannot pull or lift it, and harm comes to the patient; and when you have pulled it all out, put wool soaked in wine and rose oil on the wound site; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vessel is contracted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must cut it following its twists, but do not cut through it; and pull it as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vessel is curved, and does not slice, so that it does not cut the vein; and it has a thick curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is its shape:
of the civil vein
This vein is generated in legs, in hot regions where neither herbs nor trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture; and perhaps it grows elsewhere than in legs, and this happens from the corruption that comes under the skin, just as serpents and worms come inside the body, generated between skin and flesh.
And the signs of the beginning of this vein are that there comes in the leg a very great inflammation, then the place changes, and the vein begins to come out, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead from 1.5 to 2 ounces, and tie it, and let the lead hang from the leg, and every time it comes out at all, wrap it around the lead, and tie it; and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it has all come out; for if you cut it, it will go back into the flesh, and cause an abscess and rot in the place, and bad illness; for which reason it must be drawn little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body; and sometimes this vein when it is drawn is 5 palms long, or 10, and a man once came to me, from whom it came out 10 palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe in the hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out; and let the matter inside be emptied, and apply to the place medicines generating rot for some days, then treat it as with abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many holes come there, from which branches emerge; treat it then as we have said before.
of worms that are born between skin and flesh
This disease is called in our land "cattle disease," because it happens many times to cattle, and it is a small worm that is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body ascending and descending, and one can feel it well as it goes from member to member, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and jumps out; and it is generated from the rot of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and roundworms and pinworms come in the belly; and its malice is feared, for when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, by chance it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you want to cure and extract it, it can only be done when it moves: so it is necessary that you tie the place above and below with a strong binding very tightly, then cut above and draw it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it, then cauterize with fire above, until it dies; and the greatest harm that it does is that it corrupts the eye, as we have said; and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, tighten strongly below it the eyebrow, then cut above, and draw it out; and the patient must use purification of the body with purgative medicines for the bad rotted humors, and should avoid foods that generate rot.
of the pain that comes from windiness
This disease is called in our land "vakirir," and it is a pain that comes in some members, and then moves from member to member; and I saw what I tell you.
I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm; and a little after, I saw it climb like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from place to place; the pain left that place, and fixed itself in the shoulder, and then a little after ran throughout the body, until it came to the other arm; then she told me that it always turned around the body, just as I saw it.
I marveled much at how it moved thus from member to member, for I had never seen this disease according to this manner.
A medical case about moving pain that I had seen in a woman, though I had seen many cases where pain moved from place to place before, but not quite like this; and I thought this was because the woman had a dry body, and exposed veins, and because of this the constrained vapors appeared; and these don't appear for the same reason in those who are delicate, and who have moist bodies and hidden veins.
And when you want to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have described, then bind it above and below quickly, and then cut above until the constrained vapors in that place exit; and cauterize the place; and if you cannot see it with your eyes, then treat it with that which expels vapors, such as fetid pills, and sagapenum pills, and similar others.
Concerning arrows
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they fall.
Their diversity is such that there are those which have large points, and small ones, and hollow ones, and soldered ones; and those which have two angles, and those which have tongues, and those which have pieces; and that which falls in any member falls according to two manners: either in a principal hollow member, such as brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members.
When it therefore falls in any place of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you about hereafter, appear to you: you must refrain from extracting this arrow, for death comes afterward in several conditions; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deep, then draw it out, and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow falls there and pierces the bone, and the membrane which is over the brain protrudes, are when dizziness and stupor and vertigo and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile occur; and perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or from the ears; and perhaps speech and voice are lost; and white moisture resembling pus comes from the wound, and something like meat broth comes out; and if these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it isn't inside.
The signs of the arrow when it falls in the heart are that it is near the left breast, and feels as if it were fixed in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows from it, and coldness and cold sweat come, and syncope: know then without doubt that death approaches.
And the signs of the arrow that wounds the lung are that blood full of foam comes from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow falls in the covering of the chest, it is beside the small ribs; and causes great breathing difficulty and great pain and sighing; and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls in the stomach, perhaps something of the undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls in the belly, and any feces comes out through the broken intestine, there is no hope in the cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls in the bladder, and urine comes out and flows outside, and the patient feels strong pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other members, such as the face and the neck and the throat and the shoulder and the upper arm and the spine of the back and the chest and the thigh and the legs, and similar members, are safe according to several conditions.
When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not poisoned, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow fell into his tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and drew it out on the other side below the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And during a game, an arrow fell into the fat of the eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow was hidden, and I could only reach the point near the shaft, and the arrow was large from a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs; the wound healed, and no bad accidents occurred.
And I drew an arrow from a Christian's throat, and it was an Arabic arrow with barbs: I sawed off the barbs, and worked carefully until I drew it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I drew an arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly, and I thought he would die; and after he had passed 30 days, his condition did not change; I cut above the arrow, and worked skillfully, and drew it out, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man who had an arrow fall into his back, and the wound healed over it; and the arrow remained inside him, and his natural dispositions did not change, nor did he find any hindrance in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, who had an arrow fall into his face, and the wound healed; and he remained thus without suffering great pain; and many other similar cases.
And I drew an arrow from one of the king's princes, which had fallen in the middle of his nose, and was slightly declining to the right side; and the arrow was completely hidden. I was called to treat it after it had fallen three days before.
Thus I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a fine probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a pricking and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the point of the arrow. I put on the place an attractive and digestive plaster, so that the place would not swell; and the location of the arrow became apparent to me.
I put the plaster there for many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus for a long time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose; and he told me about it.
I put on the wound a sharp corrosive medicine for many days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow which was stuck to the place; then I enlarged the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the head of the arrow appeared visibly to me; and about 4 months had well passed, and then I enlarged the wound so that I could insert the forceps, and moved it from one side to the other, and it could not come out; then I did not cease to work carefully and devise types of instruments, until one day I took it with well-made forceps, according to the form that will come at the end of this chapter, until I drew it out, and restored the wound.
And the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was healed entirely.
Now I have told you the quality of the extraction of some arrows, so that you may direct your treatment to what I have not said, for the book cannot contain everything; but the wise master learns from very little a great thing, and from what is present and lacking, finds new work, and new instrument, for the descent of strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not come out of the members where they are fixed except according to two ways: either through the place where they enter, or through another part; and that which comes out through where it enters, is an arrow entering in fleshy places, and sometimes comes out immediately.
And if it does not come out immediately, then leave it until the flesh is rotted around it, and the exit is eased; and also if it is fixed in the bone, and it cannot come out, then leave it thus for some days, and move it each day; and then it comes out, and if it does not come out, then pierce around it with a fine drill, until the place around is enlarged, and then draw it out.
And if the arrow is fixed in the skull bone, and goes as far as one of the ventricles of the brain, and any of the symptoms I mentioned appears in the patient: do not draw it out, but leave it until it becomes loose after some days, for if the arrow reaches the dura mater, it means death.
And if the arrow is only fixed in the bone, and does not reach the dura mater, and the patient remains for some days without bad symptoms, then devise a way to extract it.
And if it is very firmly fixed thus and cannot come out, then use drills around it, as I told you; then treat the area until it heals.
And if the arrow is hidden in a place of the body where it cannot be seen, then search for it with a probe; and if you feel it, extract it with a suitable instrument; and if you cannot due to the narrowness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone or nerve or vein, then cut until the wound is large; and extract the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs that hold it, remove the flesh that is fixed in from both sides as best you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can extract it; and be careful not to break the arrow, as you would extract it with more difficulty.
And if you cannot do it at once, leave it until the area around becomes putrid, then extract it, for the extraction will be easier.
And if blood flow hinders you, then apply what we have said about the treatment in its chapter; and guard yourself from cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can best extract the arrow without danger, either quickly or slowly, either firmly or gently; and position the patient according to the position he was in when the arrow entered him, for this is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then position him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes out from another part, either something of it appears, or the skin is swollen right there so that one can see or clearly feel it: then cut above, until the forceps can grip it, and then extract it: it will come out immediately.
And if it is held in the bone, then turn your hand in circles, until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then extract it.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it still, and then begin the extraction again until it comes out; and if the shaft of the arrow is there, push it with the shaft; and if the shaft falls off, and you want to apply pushing, then use a hollow instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the hollow of the instrument; and then push out, and if the arrow is hollow, push in a pointed instrument entering it, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as required.
And if the arrow falls in the chest or in the belly or in the bladder or in the side, and it is near, and you can cut above it, then cut; and guard yourself from cutting the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if needed; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which one extracts arrows are similar to a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many types: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the hollow pusher is also like a bird's feather, for pushing at the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
The shape of the forceps for pushing and pulling is here:
of the common veins of the body
The veins from which one bleeds are 31 in number, of which 16 are in the head, namely: 2 pulsing ones which are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the 2 arteries which are visible in the two temples; and 2 veins that are in the tear ducts of the 2 eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the 2 jugulars that are in the neck; and the 2 veins that are in the upper lips of the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and 2 veins that are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are 5 in each arm: one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and lay people call it the "head vein"; and the middle one is called "faste", and is composed of the cephalic and basilic, and lay people call it the "heart vein"; and the basilic is on the right side, and lay people call it the "belly vein", and it is above the forearm, and it is the one from which one bleeds, which appears clearly above the thumb.
And the salvatella is the vein that is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has 2 branches; and in the leg and foot there are 3 veins: one is below the bend of the thumb on the left side, and the second saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nesse", which is in the ankle of the other side; and in the other leg are 3 veins below these.
The bleeding of the veins that are behind the ears helps with old catarrhs and migraine; and the method of bleeding, as I tell you, is that you shave the head of the patient, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then have the patient tighten their neck with a vise, until the 2 veins appear behind the ears in 2 places descending from the head: search for them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, mark it with ink; then take the lancet, and push it under the vein until the bone, then lift your hand with the vein upward, and cut both the skin and the vein about 2 fingers across, and let out as much blood as you want; then compress and bind it until it is healed; and I have already spoken of the incision and cautery in the first book.
The bleeding of the 2 arteries that are in the temples helps with old and solid migraine, and customary ophthalmia, and with acute tear flow in the eyes; and the method of bleeding is as I say: and it is that the patient tightens their neck until the 2 veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then mark with ink; then lift the skin above the vein upward with your index finger, and push the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward, and cut it, as you have done with the 2 other veins, and let the blood flow according to your need; then untie the patient, and put your finger on the vein for an hour, then put cotton on it; and then bind it firmly, and leave it until it is healed; and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
The bleeding of the forehead vein is as valuable as the bleeding of the cephalic for old diseases of the face, and for migraine, and for redness; and the method is that the patient tightens their neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called "fosseur" (digger), of which here is the form:
And put the point on the vein, and strike upon it with your hand, or with something else, and let the blood flow according to the quantity that you want; then untie the patient's neck, and bind the vein until it is healed; and sometimes one opens it with a wide fleam.
However, the fleam should not be too sharp; and bleed crosswise, because the bone is close, and by chance the fleam breaks when it is thin.
Bloodletting from the two veins that are in the two tear ducts helps with eye problems, and with ringworm, and with redness, and with styes in the eye, and with diseases of the face; and the method of their bloodletting is that the patient should tighten their neck by twisting with some binding, as before; then bleed them, and let the bleeding be across, a bit along the length of a somewhat wide lancet, for there is no flesh there.
And if the lancet is thin, it might break by chance; then let the blood flow as much as you need, and then bind cotton over it, and bind it well.
Bloodletting from the vein of the nose helps with acute conditions, and with sudden madness, and with diseases of the face, such as migraine and redness that comes to the face, especially when it is old; and the method of bloodletting is that the patient should tighten their neck, then squeeze their nose with your left hand, and take a thin long lancet, and stick it in the middle of the lip in the space between the two nostrils, for the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will begin to flow immediately; and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then bind it for a night, for it heals very quickly; and this is the form of the lancet:
Bloodletting from the two jugulars helps with shortness of breath, and with the beginning of leprosy, and with many diseases, and with impetigo, and with corrosive conditions, and with herpes, and gangrene; and the method of bloodletting is that the patient should tighten their neck below both of them, as we have said; and the master should stand at the patient's head, and the patient should sit on a seat, then bleed the vein lengthwise somewhat widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as needed; then do the same to the other vein, then untie the binding, and bind both veins moderately, so that the patient doesn't strangle; and leave it until morning, until the wound is healed.
On bloodletting from the lips
Bloodletting from the veins of the upper lips helps with bile in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and cracks in the lips, and of the nose and around it.
And the method of bloodletting is to have the patient sit before you, and tighten their neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are known by the fact that they are black, and by the fact that around them are small black veins: cut therefore both of them, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and do exactly the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
On bloodletting under the tongue
Bloodletting from the veins that are under the tongue helps after bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and this is for tightness of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth; and the method of bloodletting is that the patient should sit between your hands before the sun, and lift their tongue, and look underneath on each side for a black vein: bleed therefore both of them, and do not go too deep, for below are the arteries.
The veins of the elbow from which one commonly bleeds are bled according to two methods: either by pricking with a wide myrtle-shaped lancet, or with a thin olive-shaped one like cutting edges, and is called "anesil"; and they are wide or thin according to the width and narrowness of the veins.
The form of the myrtle-shaped lancet is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is needed for opening hollow veins full of thick visible blood, and that contain thick and cloudy blood; and this is the form of the olive-shaped lancet:
And it is thinner and pointed, and is for bleeding thin veins, where there is thin citrine blood.
The bloodletting of the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly; and the bloodletter must bleed wisely, and must beware of the artery that is below.
And if he cuts the artery, and blood flow comes, he must stop it, as I have said; and the lancet must not be pointed, but cutting like a lancet.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, you must bind it, and change to another; or you seek some branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut it with a sharp lancet, as we have said.
And if you want to know the place of bleeding, you must first bind the arm, that you touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then bind the arm, and cut the vein with a sharp lancet; and beware that you do not strike the artery when you see the place swollen, for that is from the artery: avoid it then.
And if you see it spurting high like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: hurry then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which happens many times; then bind the arm, and leave it thus, and let not the patient move it; and be under fear, and do not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and medicine is not present to you, then cut the artery if it appears, for its ends will retract; and the blood stops.
And take a shell of pistachio, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it well until the next day; if the blood stops, that is good; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood; and the stopping is not difficult in many cases because of the small place of the wound, and the power of the arm binding.
The bloodletting of the middle vein helps as it draws blood from the head above, and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic, as we have said; and the bloodletter must beware because of the nerve that is below, and if he pricks too deep, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and the health becomes difficult, and perhaps cannot heal; and this nerve appears many times, and if it does not appear in some men because of its subtlety, you must bleed it with the sharp instrument; and avoid the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, split it lengthwise.
The bloodletting of the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes; and one must bleed by pricking with an olive-shaped lancet or with a myrtle-shaped lancet, for it is the safest of all veins, for there is neither nerve nor artery below it.
Nevertheless, one must seek the easiest place, and it does no harm if one fails the first time, and one begins again; and perhaps the place swells in some men, when one fails the first time, but it does no harm.
The quality of the bloodletting is according to your thought.
The first thing you must know about bleeding is that bloodletting is not administered except to maintain health, and to avoid diseases to come; and let the bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow: that is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one must bleed at the beginning of spring while fasting, and in autumn and in winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear; and one must bleed the first day or the third, after two hours or three of the day.
Bloodletting which is administered for illnesses has no determined hour, but when there is need by day or by night, at all hours and in all seasons; and one must not bleed children until fourteen years, nor pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh.
Nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.
When someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary that they clean their intestines with a light clyster, if they have retained much waste, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the rotten superfluities harmful to the principal members; and one should not bleed someone who is too full of food, nor who is drunk, until they are free of it, nor those with dropsy; and one should refrain from bleeding after colic pain, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse with women, and from labor, watching and fasting, and that which drains all strength, whether from the soul or the body; then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks and medicines, if you have the means; then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed yourself from the chest vein around the third hour, as we have said; and guard yourself that day from labor, and from effort, and from luxury, and from similar things; and be cheerful and joyous, and let the bleeder be higher than the one being bled, and rub their arm 2 or 3 times, then tie the binding above moderately, for when it is too tight or loose, the blood cannot flow; and then rub the place with hands until the veins swell and can be felt; then moisten the lancet with a little old oil, then put your finger of your left hand on the vein below the place a little where you want to bleed, so that the vein doesn't flee and fail at the strike.
For there are veins that flee like cords when bleeding, and there are some that are full of windiness, so that when one puts the lancet on them, the lancet retracts, and cannot open the vein, and thus it is with these; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore it is necessary that the bleeder be aware of these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; if not, then begin again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, then leave it for 1 or 2 days, and do not bind the arm: by chance a hot abscess will come; do not enter the bath, then begin the bleeding again if it pleases him; and if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly and you doubt that enough blood will come out as you wish, then strike in that same opening with the lancet directly; and open it a little hastily, before the place becomes swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not begin bleeding again, and put on a little oil lees, for it lightens the body of blood, and the lees are better in this place than the oil; and thus administer the oil lees in each bleeding that you bleed the veins, to stanch the flow of blood; and this same thing does theriac and egg white, when one puts it on the place; thus it thins the blood and disperses when it is too thick.
And if there comes a large abscess, which happens many times, especially when it is not bled except that one time or the opening of the vein is small, then hurry, and put on the place a sponge moistened in water and salt a little hot, and bind it for an hour; and it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein, and if there remains at the place after some days some blackness or greenness, it does not harm; and if you wish, put on some aloes or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, wild mint, or similar.
And many times abscess and swelling happens at the bleeding of the basilic vein: put therefore your hand on it, and if you find the place soft at the compression of the hand, then that swelling is bad.
Avoid therefore that you put on any of the things that we have said, for by chance blood from the artery flows from it; but make a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with other treatment, until it is healed.
And draw from each person blood according to the quantity of their strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it becomes red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And for one who is full and strong, and needs blood extraction, one should make a larger wound, and use a wide lancet; and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and they should be bled little and often, and one should bleed them by cutting across, not by stabbing; and this manner of bleeding is safe from blood running and nerve cutting, and is better than bleeding lengthwise or widely.
And for one whose body fails during bleeding, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is overheated, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold complexion, he should eat before bleeding bread soaked in musk syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bleeding, after the release of much blood, he should sip meat broth, and subtle aromatic syrup, and use the other things that we have mentioned in the division or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of veins.
And if he wants to ventilate his arm, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bleeding, that he bleeds little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And who wants to ventilate his arm after the first bleeding, and has a strong body, should bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And who wants to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second day or the third.
For there is much blood inside the body that is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a large quantity, and widen the hole until he falls into a faint; after you observe all the conditions of bleeding, and put your hand on his pulse when he bleeds, lest death come instead of fainting, and this happens many times, when the bleeder is negligent; and it is not necessary when you want to untie the arm, and make blood flow a second time, and the hole is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if it is bent, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad; but let it bleed the second time; or you prick it with the point of the lancet, until the blood that is congealed at the hole of the vein comes out, and put on a little salt mixed with water, and press lightly upon it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it, until the swelling has subsided.
And if there is necessity to draw blood a second time, bleed him in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the vein of the head because it is composite.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in hot water, until the forearm becomes red; then it should be tied moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed immediately across, not widely nor lengthwise; and let the hole be wide, and let it be bled very close to the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot flow out, put the hand back in hot water, and let the blood run in the water, until you have enough; and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back in hot water, for one puts it there more in winter than in summer; and the bleeding of this vein is safer than all other veins, as there is neither artery nor nerve.
The bloodletting from the salvatella vein of the right hand is effective for all liver diseases, and here is the method: tighten the hand, and place it in hot water until the vein becomes swollen, so that one can see it; and make the cut crosswise, and if you cut it completely through, it causes no harm; and do not go too deep, for the nerves beneath are bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in hot water if the blood has congealed in the wound and cannot flow out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and salt on the vein to heal it quickly, and do the same for each branch.
The bloodletting from it in the left hand is effective for diseases of the spleen, and do exactly as I told you for the right side.
The bloodletting from the saphenous vein is effective for all diseases that are below the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menses, and disease of the kidneys, and old ailments of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
And the method of its bloodletting is that the patient puts their foot in hot water, and rubs above the vein until it appears, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and many branches go above the foot; then bleed it at the largest branch, or at the ankle, which is better.
And if you bleed it above the foot, guard against the nerves that are beneath, and cut it crosswise as if cutting; and let the lancet be very thin.
And if the blood cannot flow out, put the foot back in the water, and let the vein drain well.
And if the bloodletter fails the first time, begin again a little above, for the place is safe; and do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and its bloodletting is effective for pain in the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the method of its bloodletting is that the patient enters the bath, and tightens above the ankle four fingers while twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear; and if it appears, bleed it in all ways that you can, and crosswise; and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very hidden in many men.
And if you cannot find it, then bleed some branch of it that appears on the top of the foot, and toward the little toe, and guard against the nerves; and let as much blood flow as you want, and then untie the binding, and put cotton on it and tighten it; it is healed immediately.
On cupping bloodletting
Cups are made of horns, or brass, or glass; and cupping is done according to 2 methods: either by cutting and drawing blood, or without cutting.
And this cupping which is without cutting is done in 2 ways: either with fire, or without fire; and cupping which is done by cutting and drawing blood is done in 14 places of the body, of which one is at the top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and 2 others on the two sides of the neck; and the cup under the chin; and the cup of the two shoulders; and the cup on the haunches; and the cups in the middle of the two arms; and the cups of the two legs; and the cups of the two ankles; and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and because of this one does not weaken, as one does from bleeding a vein; and it should not be administered, neither with fire nor without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illnesses one must cup, or by custom, we administer it each time at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle and at all times; for there are those who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head; and there are those who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and neck, and darkness in their eyes; and those who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are those who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we command them to be cupped after 3 hours of the day.
The bleeding of the crown helps with the heaviness of the head ... that comes to the eyes, and should not be done after the evacuation of the whole body; and this cupping is in place of bleeding from the cephalic vein, and those who are of cold complexion should not use it, or who have catarrh, for it does them much harm; and therefore old people should not use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And he who bleeds from it often becomes forgetful, and therefore one should place the cup a little lower for fear of forgetfulness.
The cupping in the middle of the neck is in place of bleeding from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it helps with tightness of the chest, and splitting of the lung channel, and cough, and repletion; and it should be applied little, for if it holds too firmly, it engenders forgetfulness in the stomach and heart.
The cupping on the two sides of the neck helps with head pains, and ophthalmia and migraine, and choking, and pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bleeding from the basilic vein; and you should command the cupper to press his hand when applying it, so he doesn't cut the artery, and bleeding doesn't occur.
The cupping under the chin helps with mouth disease, and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and is in place of bleeding from the two lips.
The cupping of the shoulders helps with illness that comes from heat and from repletion.
The cupping of the elbows is worth as much as the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins; and instruct the bleeder not to strike too deeply, for the place is bare of flesh, and there are nerves and arteries beneath.
The cupping glass that is placed on the lower back is effective for hemorrhoids of the fundament and for ailments below, and the cup should be large and made of brass, as it needs to draw well; and if by chance it were thin, it would break; and make large incisions there.
The cups of the legs bleed openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are effective for old pains of the kidneys, of the womb, and of the bladder, and bring back menstruation; and they serve in place of the two saphenous veins and the two ankles, and nevertheless they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in several conditions.
The method of applying the cup is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease doing this until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of blood appears; then strike, and replace the cups, and take care regarding the condition of bodies, for there are those who have tender flesh and clear pores: so it is necessary to strike only once, and make wide wounds, somewhat deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to thin the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time; and when we want to draw blood little by little, then once suffices for us.
And if we want more blood, we often restart; and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the timing is such that the heart should be pierced suddenly, and for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, you must anoint the places for the cupping vessels with aperitive and dissolving oil: if it's in summer, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil; and if it's in winter, with watercress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then take amaranth oil, or costmary oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
And if the one being bled has tender flesh and wide pores, there's no need to apply oil, but it's necessary to wash after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or pumpkin water, or purslane water, or something similar.
And those who have much moisture should wash with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities should wash with old wine, or elder water, or decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things; and one should not apply cupping vessels before the bath nor during the bath, but after the bath one hour or two; and do not sleep after the cupping, and it's necessary to purge oneself, when one must be cupped and when one has been cupped.
And observe if the one being bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then they should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuce with vinegar, and similar things; and eat chickens, and castrated sheep meat, and moist foods.
And those who have a cold complexion should take honey syrup, and fragrant wine of medium age, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chickens and small birds and pigeons; and on the day they are cupped, they should drink more than eat; and it's necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before the cupping, or after, to strengthen the principal members; and the blood should be thinned, but those who are hot should not drink it.
The cupping vessels that are applied without striking are those that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and gout, and on the belly and the navel and the kidneys and the hip, for these members do not suffer striking upon them, and it is only done to draw blood from member to member, as we put them on the breasts when the nose bleeds; to remove the viscosity that is in the member, as we put cupping vessels on the belly and on the navel to diminish the member; and it removes the pain, when there is blockage or stone, it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the blockage, or dislodges the stone from its place; and thus it does when one puts it on the liver and on the spleen when there is retained windiness, and these cupping vessels are administered empty for sucking only; and sometimes they are administered together with fire, and sometimes full of tepid water, as in diseases of pleurisy, and in such manner that one fills the cupping vessel with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been cooked for this purpose.
The form of the cupping vessel administered with fire is thus:
And it should be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and should have on the side around the middle a small hole, as if to insert a needle, and should be made of brass, smooth in front so that it doesn't hurt the patient when placed on the limb; and should have in the middle a crossbar of brass or iron, to place a lit candle, and there should be both large and small ones according to the illnesses and the age of those who receive them; for the cups for children are different from those for the elderly, and those for thin people different from those for fat people.
And one should place this cup on the limb thus: light the wax candle or a wick, and place it in the middle of the cup across the rod that is in the middle of the cup, so that the light is at the bottom of the cup where it won't burn the patient; and then place it on the limb, and your finger should be on the hole that we mentioned, so that when desired, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cup; and one lights the wick as before, and starts again often, if you have need.
For the cup that is administered in cases of pleurisy, with water, there is no rod or hole, and it is only administered when it is full of water, and is placed on the limb only; and this is its form:
Leeches are only administered in places where cups cannot be placed due to their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and other similar ones; and the proper way to use them is that when you find leeches that are in clean fresh waters without rot, take them; and put them one night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then bleed with a vein and cup, then rub the limb until it is red, and put on the leeches; and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where you can put a cup, put one there, for this is very beneficial afterward.
If not that, then wash the place with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then squeeze it; and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches' feeding, moisten a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the blood is stanched; and if the blood is multiplied, put ground vitriol on it, or galls, and similar things, until it is stanched; or put on the place halved peeled beans, and leave them until they stick to the place, and it will stanch immediately; and if you have more need of them, take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to attach, rub the place with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood comes out, and then put them on, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach; and when you want them to fall off, sprinkle on a little ground aloe and salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures
This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish physicians avoid this chapter, for they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read their letters; and for this reason science is foreign in our land, for I never found any good ones; and I know nothing of it, except through the science of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn forth the science, and through experiment, and through the experience of my life; and I have already described to you in this chapter what is contained, and have abbreviated it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of instruments that are administered, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is therefore fitting that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the word and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells upon the truth, so that those who are proven may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when fracture or dislocation or torsion or crushing happens to someone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient from one side and the other, unless something prevents you, such as weakness of body, or childhood, or old age; or if the weather is very hot, or too cold; and let him eat cold things, that is to say cold broths, and bird meat and kid meat, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you no longer fear hot aposteme, nor spreading of matter to the limb; then let the patient return to his previous regimen that he was used to.
And when the broken bone begins to restore, it is necessary that one nourish the patient with foods that make thick nourishment, where there is viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow stomach, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things.
For with such nourishment the fracture heals better and faster.
And know that the broken bones of the elderly and decrepit cannot well heal nor solder according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor also those who are too tender, such as bones of small children; but do not worry, bring upon the broken bone a thick cartilage that adheres and joins the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not prevent it from its work, and for this reason it is necessary to nourish him with thick foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For the fracture of the head is different than the fracture of the chest, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all manners of fracture.
For there is fracture that goes in an arc, and another in sharpening, like the cut of a quill for writing.
And there is fracture with wound, and fracture with just a small crack.
And each manner has its device, and its proper instrument in the restoration, according to how the memory comes in its place; and the fracture of the bone is known by the fact that the place is twisted, and appears well from outside, and sounds when pressed by the hand; and when there is no twisting nor sound to the touch, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture; but there can well be twisting, or cracking, or small fracture.
So it is not fitting that you move it with the hand, but put on medicines that come hereafter, and then bind it now subtly.
And know that for a break that goes in a circle, where the two parts are disjointed, they must now be set equally, before a hot inflammation comes; and if hot inflammation comes, leave it for some days, until the inflammation has subsided; then set it equally as best you can gently and wisely, and know that its restoration is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces; then bind it, as will be explained hereafter.
And if there are broken pieces in the bone, stretch it from two sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two ropes, or with one rope and your hand; and put the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken limb are separated, bring back by all means the additions to their places as best you can, and ensure that through your work no injury or pain comes to the patient; and join well the two bone ends in the best form.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well set: then straighten it gently, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press as do those who through their work bring about hot inflammation and contraction to the limb, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is set, strongly warn the patient not to move it, neither while awake nor sleeping, nor in turning, nor in any other way; and ensure well that the limb is so secured that he feels no pain.
For when he feels any pain, it is not well set, and it must be put in such a position that he feels no pain; and take care that it is set straight, that no twisting comes when it is restored; and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are different in smallness and in size and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar ones: these must be wrapped in soft and thin linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg: these must be wrapped with a wide and hard bandage, for the wide bandage embraces all of the large limb, and binds it equally from all sides, so that there is no mark; then bind around light tow, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little with all the bandage, then go above the break and bind it less, that the break then distances the break a little; and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and turn around again over the broken area; then go back to the part below the break, and bind it moderately, neither too strongly nor too softly, as we have said in the first binding above; then put between the bandages linen tow or cloths, until it is all equal, then bind all over with a bandage, and then put your well-made splints on top, if there is no inflammation or swelling.
And if there is swelling or inflammation, then put on something that calms hot inflammation, and that removes the swelling, and leave it thus for some days; then tighten over your splints, and let them be of half of a wide reed carefully scraped, or of wood from which are made splints, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:
But it is necessary that the splint that one puts on the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the others; and be as long as is appropriate for the limb's smallness or largeness; then tighten over the splints as you did with the first binding, then tie a thread appropriately above, as in the first binding over the fracture; tighter near it, gradually less so further away; and the threads should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and should be of soft linen; for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bindings with twisted linen cords, this is a great error, for the binding cannot be even if it is too thin, and there should not be less than a finger's width of space between each splint.
And if the patient is wounded by the ends of the splints after tightening in healthy places, put linen tow or carded wool underneath them, so that he is not injured.
When the wound is with the fracture, and the heart is broken, I will speak of the cure hereafter.
And know that it is not necessary to tighten with splints all broken limbs on the first day.
For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to put splints except after 5 days or 7, or more according to your certainty of hot swelling occurring; and here is the manner of ancient plasters for restoring fracture, dislocation, and sprain: take the flour that sticks to the walls of the mill, and mix it with egg white, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common manner of the restorative plaster for fractures in many conditions, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and sprain: take 3 measures of abareis and ladanum and elecampane and asafoetida and gum arabic and nutmeg, 10 drams each; myrrh and aloes, 5 drams each; alechil 9 drams; and make powder, and mix them with egg white; if the man's complexion is hot, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and restores broken bones quickly, and is valuable for many men.
Another manner of plaster that is good for sprain: take nutmeg and marshmallow, 10 drams each; myrrh and aloes, 9 drams each; acacia 6 drams; Armenian bole 10 drams, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply it.
Another manner of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and calms the occurring pain, and the cut use of the bone, and the fracture: take new wool, and soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and put it on the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for calming hot swelling, and specifically removes the pains.
Another manner of plaster which restores broken bones: take dried fig leaves, and leaves of ground poppy, and grind together, and make a plaster.
Another manner of plaster for the restoration of bone fracture and for reducing the remainder of the swelling.
Take marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, one part of each; and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is heated, mix it with water of fresh coriander, or water, and use it.
Another manner of plaster stronger than the first, when hard swelling comes to the restoration of the limb.
Take marshmallow roots, and linseed, pomegranate flower, melilot, and savory, and violet flowers and chamomile, one part of each; and grind, and mix with willow water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates said in his book that one should put nothing on a broken limb to heal it except a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else more, and said that it should be neither too soft nor too hard between the two.
And it seems to Galen that one should put on the broken limb, to heal it, dry things a little warm, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that works for injury and pain: take mugwort and chopped human hair, or bird feathers, and marshmallow plant, and salt equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it.
And then unbind it a little after, and check if the patient feels no pain, and if the bone has not moved from its place; if not, don't unbind it for many days. And if pain comes to the place, or itching, without rest or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately; and take light cloth, and wet sea sponge, and plunge in water, and wash the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is calmed; then let the limb rest an hour, then put dry wool on it, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind it for a night, until you are sure about hot inflammation; and let the inflammation of the limb subside, and let the pain be removed, then begin again the subtle binding, and a little plaster, and don't tighten it as strongly as before; and make it subtle until it is healed.
And if you see that hot inflammation and redness and pain and swelling are already completely removed, and you need plaster and binding, then begin again, as you did first equally.
And if none of what we have mentioned comes to the limb, then don't unbind it except after 3 days or 4 or 5 or 7; and sometimes leave it 20 days, according to what one sees, until the break adheres, and the joining of the flesh approaches above; then tighten it more than first, and increase his food, as I said before; and if you see the place drying more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there; water it then with lukewarm water, every time you unbind it, and this should be every third day, and loosen the binding a little; by this work therefore nourishment runs to the limb, and quickly mends what foolish doctors do, who restore the limb crookedly: this is bad, and it is dangerous work, and I see nothing else than to leave it and work properly.
Of the various types of breaks
There are many types of breaks, and different shapes, and the causes are distinct; for there are breaks that are made by sword strike, and the blow removes all the bone down to the syfac which is under the bone, as does an axe or club; and for this reason this type of break is called "axing."
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this type of break is called "absolute"; and the wound of these two breaks is large or small.
And if there is a dented percussion, or crack or from stone blows, or from falling on stone, or from other similar things.
And if there is a piercing break, which approaches down to the membrane that is under the bone, or it is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And there is a wound that is hidden in the bone as subtle as a hair, and the crack is small, and for this reason this break is called "capillary"; and if the wound is made either by striking of stone, or by falling, or by similar thing, and makes the piece of bone enter downward, and the place is hollowed as do the cauldron-makers when they strike on the cauldrons; thus the stone enters within.
And this happens more to those who have moist bones in the head, such as a child's head; and it happens to all these types of breaks that small pieces are separated like splinters; and I will speak of it in its place.
And we know all types of breaks by the examination upon them, and the investigation with probes, and by the corrupted flesh that is above.
The capillary fracture is recognized by this: when one has exposed the bone, and one rubs ink on it, the break appears black.
In treating the fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as bile vomiting, loss of consciousness, tension, fainting, acute fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar conditions in multiple instances, then he cannot heal without doubt.
And if you see no frightening symptoms, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded person first comes to you, and it is winter, you must remove the bone before the fourteenth day at best as you can.
And if it is summer, hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone becomes corrupted, and the symptoms we mentioned appear.
And if the bone fracture reaches the membrane that covers the brain, you must split the broken part thus: take the wounded patient's head, and expose the bone in all ways that you can, and above the wound shape as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs when exposing the bone, or hot swelling, help it with what is needed, which is to fill the area with cloths soaked in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot swelling has subsided, and you are assured there is no bleeding; then begin around the bone to remove it, and this is done according to two methods of operation: one method is that you cut with the narrow cutting tool first, and this is the shape:
And then insert another cutting tool larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different cutting tools, some narrow and others wide, and they should be pointed, and should be of Indian iron; and work gently, so you don't wound the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, you must pierce around it, before you apply cutting tools with drills, not so deep that they pierce through the skull bone, and it must have above the point a margin or a circle, that doesn't let the point pass through the bone; and you must have several, so that each comes to its place in the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all skulls; and this is the shape of the three types of drills:
The procedure for drilling around the broken bone is that you place a drill on the bone, and turn with your fingers until you know the bone is pierced; then put the drill in another place a little further along, and do this all around, then cut with scissors the space of bone between the holes, and do this as delicately as you can, and gently, as we have said, until you can remove the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments you have such as pincers, forceps; and be careful not to touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and removed the bone, it is necessary that you scrape away the roughness that remains of the bone with another instrument similar to scissors, but it must be thinner and more delicate than the other scissors; and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with dressings and ointments that we have mentioned.
And the other manner of operation is that which Galen describes, which is safer; and he praised it very strongly, and these are his words.
First it is necessary that you uncover a part of the bone, there where the break appears most clearly, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place underneath it the head of this lenticular knife, of which here is the form:
And do not cut from one side, and the sharp part is on two sides, so that the cutting edge is toward the bone; then strike with a small mallet above, so that you cut the bone gently all around, and take great care of the membrane that is beneath; if it is attached to the bone, remove it gently, for one can remove it well without harm and without fear.
And if the break in the bone does not pierce through to the membrane, and the bone is cut only on top, and there are small pieces, it is necessary to scrape away that roughness, and remove the scales with a fine rasp of which you should have various sizes, to use in each place the most suitable one, according to the work and the shape of the break.
Thus scrape first with large rasps, and afterward with finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well done.
In each of the other hairline cuts and fine breaks, it is necessary that you administer treatment according to its direction; and this is something that is not hidden from one who has applied himself to study in this art.
And if the dura mater is exposed, it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth folded in two or three, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so that you do not harm the dura mater, then administer another bandage above, and do not tighten it more than needed to just hold the wound; and leave it thus for one or two days, until the hot swelling has subsided, then unbind it, and administer medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things; and make powder of these things, and put it on the wound, and always administer cleansing medicines without irritation; and ensure that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave the ointment there, nor allow pus to gather, for when pus gathers on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and rots it, and great harm comes to the patient; for when one puts irritating things on the dura mater, it blackens on top.
Take heed then, if any bad symptoms come to the patient, as we have said, it is doubtless doubtful.
And if blackness comes only from the medicine that was put on it, which has such property, you should take one part honey, and three parts rose oil and spread it on a cloth, and put it on the membrane; then treat it with the types of treatments that are appropriate, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both upper parts of the nose are broken, or one by itself, for these are two bones; and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, it only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must insert your little finger into the nostril, and align that break inside with your index finger, and thumb on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and ensure that the patient feels no pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the spot, you must align it with the head of a somewhat thick stick.
And if the break is on both sides, do the same thing, and hasten to restore it the first day, if you can; if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot swelling has subsided, then insert tents of linen cloth at the tip of the nose, if the break is on one side.
Or insert another on the other side, if the break is there; and let the tents be thick enough to fill the nostrils.
And some healers said that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day.
It doesn't seem right to me, but they should be moistened in a mixture of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are inserted in the nose instead of tents, with a soft cloth around them, and it holds the break, and the patient can breathe through it; now do whichever you prefer.
And if hot swelling comes to the nose while you are working on it, apply a cerate or cotton moistened in rose oil, or in a little diachylon.
And if no hot swelling comes, apply a plaster on the outside, of sesame flour and frankincense powder, mixed with egg white, then put light tow on it, and do not bind the nose; and if the break of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract it with instruments suitable for this, then sew the split, and treat it with things that generate flesh and bond, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this; and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead tubes in it until it is healed.
On the fracture of the mandible
When the mandible is broken below, and there is no external wound, and the break is only external, and is not broken in two but just curved inward, one recognizes it easily.
If the break is on the right side, you must put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the break is in the left mandible, put your right hand's index finger, and push the break inward gently, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the break of the mandible is separated in two, you must apply extension from both sides until it is even.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, bind them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then put a wax plaster on the broken mandible, and put a double cloth on it; and put on the cloth a large well-made splint, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the mandible, and bind it as best you can, and command the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then reset what has changed; and put a plaster on it, of mill powder with egg white or sesame flour, after you have removed the wax plaster; and put light wool on the plaster, and if the plaster adheres, and the patient's condition doesn't change, leave it until it heals; many times it heals in three weeks.
And if hot swelling comes, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is both fracture and wound together, see if any piece of bone has come away; carefully remove it with instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a lancet according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound if it is wide, and put on one of the suitable plasters for this, to generate flesh, until it heals.
On the clavicle
The clavicle breaks many times in front, toward the shoulder, and the break is of three types: either it is broken and separated in two, and has pieces, and is the easiest to restore; or there is a break with a wound.
And the procedure when the break is without wound is that you should have two assistants, so that one holds the humerus next to the broken clavicle; and the other extends the neck to the side; then make the break even with your fingers, so that the form is as it should be, with neither protrusion nor depression.
And if you need to extend more, put under the patient's shoulder a round ball of cloth, or of wool, and let it be thick according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and press the ball with your hand, so that you make the break even, as it should be.
And if you cannot draw the head of the clavicle outward, because it goes deep, the patient must lie supine on his neck, and put a medium pillow under the shoulder, and the assistant should push the shoulder down, until the clavicle bone is raised.
And then straighten the break with your fingers, and if you find it broken, you must cut into it; and draw out the pieces gently, and if the bone cannot join due to some protrusion, cut it with one of the incisors that you have; but put this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the pleura:
And it looks like a spoon, and is not hollow, and should be as wide as needed, according to the size of the bone and the power of the work; and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide and the other narrow, just as is the opening of the wound that you made when you drew out the bones; and when you are sure about hot swelling, then sew the wound, and if the opening is small, or you fear hot swelling, then fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.
And if hot swelling comes, then moisten a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and put it on.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cutting, is that you put on the bone the plaster of mill powder and egg white, and put light tow on top, and put a ball under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very large bandage of a palm's width, then put a double cloth over the tow and the plaster; then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around this bandage, so that the ends of the bandage are hanging; and put the splint over the break, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the sick armpit; and bring it back from each side, and when you see that the binding holds the break properly, and you see clearly that the splint doesn't move from the broken bone, then check it each day, and when the binding loosens, tighten it; and make the patient lie on his back, and put when he sleeps a small pillow under the armpit, to raise the upper arm high; thus the break of the collarbone will be eased by the raising of the shoulder, or you tie his arm to his neck, and don't unbind it unless bad symptoms appear, until 20 days; then renew the plaster, if you see that it needs it, and tighten it and leave it thus, until it is restored; and it is restored at most in 28 days, and in less for some men.
About the break of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks in the wide place or in the middle, and one knows it only by touch; so treat it according to the shape of the break, and bring it back to its natural form, in all the ways that you can; then put on the place mill powder with egg white, and light tow, and put on a double cloth; then put on a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if below the splint there is hollowness in any place of the shoulder, then fill that hollow with flax tow, so that the splint sits evenly; and then bind it firmly with a large bandage, so that the splint doesn't move from its place, and check the binding each day; and every time it loosens, tighten it, and put the splint even if it is out of its place, and let the patient lie on his side; and the shoulder is restored in 20 days or in 25, And when this number is completed, then unbind it, and be sure, for this is not a bone that moves out easily.
And if a piece of the bone tends forward, and points under the skin, then cut above it, and remove it, and do what we have said in the break of the collarbone about calming hot swelling.
On the breaking of the chest
The chest sometimes breaks in the middle, but this happens rarely; however, it often breaks on the outside.
And when it breaks in the middle, it sinks downward, and the patient feels great pain, and lack of breath, and coughs, and perhaps vomits blood, and the movement is apparent in the broken bone, and one can feel it well.
And the treatment is that the patient lies supine on his back, and one puts a cushion between the shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings together the ribs from both sides with your hands, and carefully puts them equal in all the ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be; then put on plasters and hemp above the thin splint of willow, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the binding around to the back, and tighten it appropriately, and check the binding every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it; and if it needs to be untied, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or swelling, then hurry, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and address what has come there in terms of treatments; then reapply the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
On the breaking of the ribs
Know that the breaking of the ribs only comes out in thick places near the back, and at the inner end, and they only bend out because they are slippery; and one can feel it well when examining with the fingers.
And the treatment is that you set the break evenly, as it should be.
And then put the plaster, and tighten it with a splint, if you need one.
And if the break of the ribs is declining inward, the patient feels very great pain, and stabbing, just like pleurisy, because the bone pricks the membrane; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits a great quantity of blood, and this is of serious health concern, and the ancients put great ingenuity into it.
And there are those who say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the break outward.
We do not do this, lest hot swellings come there, if they haven't already come.
And if it has come, then bleed it.
And some of them said that one puts cupping glasses on the place, to suck strongly, and this seems reasonable; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass might draw superfluities to the place because of the disposition of weakness.
And some of them said that one should cover the place with wool soaked in hot oil, and one puts tents between the ribs to make the binding even all around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear because of the bone that pricks the membrane, and there is concern for the patient, then it is necessary to cut above the place of the broken rib, and it is necessary to put an instrument below to protect the peritoneum; and then one should cut the bone, and draw it out gently, and then sew the two lips of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if hot swelling comes, then put cloths soaked in rose oil, and put them on the place; and meanwhile treat the place with what is necessary for swelling, and have them lie supine on the side where they should, until they are healed.
of the breaking of the neck
Sometimes breaking occurs in the neck bones, and rarely does it bend; and likewise in the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will heal or not, observe if you see their hands softened and swollen and dead, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it.
Know that it is fatal in most cases, and if they move and feel well when one squeezes and pricks them, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if care is given.
And if similar things happen to the spine of the back, and you want to know if they will heal or not, observe if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms there are like those in hands, and if on the back there comes flatulence and excrement without control; and when one lays them on their belly, excrement comes out without control.
And when they are laid on their back and they want to defecate, they cannot.
Know that it is fatal: so do not labor in their treatment.
And if these symptoms do not come to them, then the matter is lighter.
And the treatment is that you observe if there is hot swelling, then put rose oil or egg yolk oil on the spine, until it is calmed; then put on one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and command the patient to rest; and not to sleep on the part where they feel the pain, until they are healed.
And if any bone separates, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed; and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "tail head," push your thumb of your left hand, and make it even with the other hand to your ability, then put the plaster and the splint on top, if you need it; then tighten it, and if there is separated bone, cut above it, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
On the breaking of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone breaks, and if it happens, it only occurs with a small reduction at the head; and it splits lengthwise, and tilts inward, and pain comes to the patient at the site, and puncture, and that which is broken swells.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the break; and know what the break is and its shape; and if the break is at the head only, then make that break even, until it is in its natural shape.
And if the break is lengthwise, or it tilts inward, then make the patient lie on their stomach, until the restoration of that break is prepared for you.
And when you have made it even, put the plaster on it, then put on a splint of wood or leather, and tighten the break, so that it does not move; and fill the place under the ribs, until the binding is even.
And command the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if hot swelling comes there, do not touch it until the hot swelling has calmed, and put on what we have mentioned before; and then return to the restoration, and tighten it as is appropriate, if there is no bad complication; and this is the method.
On the breaking of the humerus
The humerus is what is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, one must restore it according to one of two methods: of which one is that you take a smooth piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie two bonds at the two ends, and hang them high, and seat the patient on a seat; then throw their broken arm over the wood, until it comes to the armpit, and have in the middle a curve of wood, then hang some heavy thing or have the assistant pull downward; then let the physician make the break even with his hands together, until the break returns as it should.
And the other method is that one lays the patient on their back, and ties their hand to their neck, then commands two assistants that one hold what is above the break with his hands, and the other hold below with a bond, and each pulls to his side.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, then tighten a bond below the break, and above the break, and have each of the assistants pull to their side.
And if the break is near the head of the shoulder, then you must put a medium bond under the armpit, and another toward the elbow, below the break; and also if the break is toward the elbow, then you must put a bond gently, without labor, until the break is even over the place, and over the elbow; then make the break even, as is appropriate, and tighten it, if hot swelling does not come.
And if hot swelling comes there, do not tighten it until seven days, and put on wool moistened in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot swelling has calmed; then tighten it, and the method of tightening is that you put the plaster on the break, then bring the arm together over the humerus, and put your hand over the shoulder or over the breast; and put the cloth, and tighten over the humerus, and over the arm, so that the arm serves as splints, if nothing prevents you from doing so, or if the bone has not moved.
And if you fear that the bone might move, use splints, and put over the break a splint wider and stronger than the others, and leave a finger's width between each splint, and let each splint be large enough that it extends three fingers' width on each side of the break; then tighten over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on breaks, more firmly and less as you move away.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, at the time when you restore the broken limb, and you fear hot swelling, leave it unbandaged until the seventh day, as we have said; then check the binding every three days, so that no itching or swelling comes to the area, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight.
Straighten it, as we have said.
And if no such accidents occur, do not unbind it except after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and keep his hands on his stomach; and put under the upper arm a cushion filled evenly with wool, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the binding does not become loose; straighten it through the power of medicine, and give him the food that we have prescribed before, in such a way that the food should be light at first; and when it begins to heal, let it be substantial.
And it is customary that the upper arm and the leg should be completely healed in 40 days; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointment medicines to straighten the area.
And if the constriction is ugly and swollen, delay unbinding for 50 days or 2 months.
On the breaking of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "foscile" (forearm bones), of which one is small, and is the one that follows the thumb; and the other is large, and is the one that is below, toward the little finger; by chance the large foscile breaks alone, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing; and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and more difficult than when they are both broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken alone, it needs little extension, gently, and to be set evenly.
And if it is the large foscile, it needs to be bound more firmly; and extend it on a cushion, and keep the thumb of the hand higher than the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher up, so that the patient suffers no exertion; then let the assistant extend his arm at the lower part with his hand, or with a binding, and another assistant at another at the top.
And then let the physician set it evenly, according to its best form.
And if there are pieces in the break, put each in its place, and if there is any separated piece that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut above it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the break there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter; so take the cure from there.
And if at the beginning of the restoration a hot swelling appears, then apply a cloth with cerate made of rose oil and white wax, which should be neither too hard nor too soft; and bind a cloth over it gently, until the hot swelling is calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and apply the plaster of mill powder with egg white, then put the splints, and let the splint over the break always be stronger and a bit wider than the others; and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several arrangements: whether the break is in one bone or in two; and tighten more over the break than elsewhere, and always less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are over the break be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread used for binding be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after some days.
And if any bad conditions come to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, it is necessary that you sprinkle the limb with hot water until the itching is calmed; and let the limb rest not too tightly bound.
And then begin the tightening again, and if the binding is loosened and the bones separated, and similar things, then straighten it.
And if you notice that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight, it is necessary that you loosen it a little, and leave it so for some days, until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have mentioned happens to the patient, do not unbind it until twenty days.
or thereabouts, then hang the hands from their neck, and let their neck be level, and guard against movement and tossing, and sleep on their back; and know that this break is restored in thirty days or in thirty-five, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of strengths.
Of the break of the hand
Know that breaks rarely occur in the back of the hand and in the knuckles of the fingers, and nothing comes there but bending many times.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or bent, it is necessary that the patient sit cross-legged, and sit straight before you evenly; then put their hand on the extended cloth, and let the assistant extend the broken bones, and let the physician make them even, until they are well joined; and put the plaster and the tow, if swelling doesn't come, then put a splint according to the size of the place; and let it be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the break is on the inside near the belly of the palm, make a ball of cloths, and command the patient to grip it with their broken palm; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and tighten it as necessary.
And if the break is on the outside, it is necessary that you put one splint above, and another below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and secure the binding between the fingers.
And if the break comes to any of the knuckles of the fingers, if it is the thumb, then set it evenly, as necessary; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish put a small straight splint to raise the break, and let it not move; and if the break is in the other fingers, such as in the index or one of the others, then set it evenly, and bind it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or bind them all together, which is better, or put a splint on top, as with the thumb; and take care in the restoration and in the condition of hot swelling, and help what comes there, as I have said.
Of the broken thigh
The thigh bone is often broken, and one can see it well when it turns forward and backward; and the treatment is to tie one binding above the break, and another below.
And the patient should lie on their face, then each assistant should pull their binding on their side equally; and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is close to the root of the thigh, let one of the bindings be toward the groin, and the other binding below the break.
And likewise if it is close to the knee, and then let the binding be next to the knee, and let the extension be downward; then let the physician align the bone with his two hands, until it is according to its natural shape, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no hot swelling comes.
And if there is hot swelling, let it subside then return to your work and your treatment; the binding is done in such manner.
It is necessary that you wrap over the break a hard bandage doubled in 2 or 3, and leave the excess, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the buttocks, and push a long thread between the thigh and the leg, next to the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come to the top; then wind the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then put splints over the break, and put a splint over the leg bone; then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to make the tightening even, then begin to bind strongly 3 or 4 turns over the break; and the further you go from the break, the less you tighten it; then attend to the two ends of the thread that you pushed between the leg and thigh, and bind with it the 3 splints that are above, then go back below to the end of the thread, until you come next to the foot; and tighten it, so that it does not move from its place, then leave it thus, as long as there comes neither swelling nor inflammation nor other similar thing.
And if it happens, then unbind it, and address what comes, as we have said many times; and if there are pieces of bone that stick out, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to split open the place, and draw them out; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken such that one puts splints there, as in the shoulder and arm; nevertheless, in the restoration done thus the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in 50 days, or a little less or a little more, according to the differences in constitutions.
Of the kneecap
Know that in the kneecap breakage happens rarely, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is but a crack, or a hole, and happens with a wound, and without wound, and this is well felt.
And the restoration is that one should align what is round with one's fingers, until it is assembled as best one can; then put the plaster, and put a round splint, if you have need of it, and tighten it as is necessary, then watch for all the conditions that we have spoken of in other breaks, such as hot swelling and other similar things; so apply to each accident what it requires, until it is healed.
On the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is rightly called "mustelz" [tibia], and the other is called "foscile" [fibula]; and the same type of fracture occurs as in the arm, and therefore the restoration is done just as with the arm, and the procedure is the same. And if both bones are broken together, the leg turns in all directions.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the thick bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one can see it well; and it turns downward.
Then apply extension, and set it evenly, and bind the splints equally; however, if the fracture is ugly, and there are multiple pieces, the extension should be lesser and gentler; and ease it according to your strength.
And when you have completed all your work, take two hollowed wooden bands that encompass the leg on both sides, and should be the length of the leg from the knee down; then wrap bandages in two places above and below, and tie it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg cannot turn to right or left, and this is good; and some apply a cradle the length of the leg, made of wood, and one puts the leg there to prevent movement, and this is especially done in fractures with wounds; and move the leg each day, to see if there is hot swelling or other complications; treat it until it is healed.
On the fracture of the foot bones
The ankle does not get fractures, but the foot bones sometimes get fractures and the toes rarely, and nothing occurs except crushing in several arrangements.
And if a fracture occurs in the foot bones, and you see these bones overlapping one another, have the patient put their foot on the ground, as if they wanted to walk, and then put your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, then press until they return to their places; then put the plaster and tow on top, and put under the sole of the foot a small board with two flat ends, then bind it to the foot properly, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, undo the binding, for you will find the bones even, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them, as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then put on the broken toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then put under the foot that board that I mentioned, and bind it properly; and if there are two or three, or more, broken, put on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and it should stand on the end of the board outside the sole of the foot, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, which we have discussed; and treat each complication as appropriate.
From the breaking of the wrist bone
When the bone of a woman's private parts is broken, have her sit with legs spread, then lean her toward her back, and let her be held from behind; then let the midwife fill the patient's private parts with cotton, and put in as much as a coin's worth; then push the woman, and raise her back little by little, and then the cotton comes out, until it comes to the entrance of the private parts, and the bone returns with the coin; and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back, and do this for 7 days or thereabouts: the break will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a reed to the opening, and push the whole bladder into the private parts; then blow strongly into the reed until the bladder is inflated inside: the break in the private parts will return; then fill it with cotton, and leave it thus for some days, until it is healed.
And when the wrist bone of a man is broken, or of a woman, restore it as we have said for the hip bone; and these breaks are not hidden from one who applies their study and practice to it, and understands my book.
For the break shows in several conditions the right way of restoration: understand it then.
For the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and insert the penis; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for 3 days or thereabouts, and it will be healed quickly.
Of breaks with wounds
It is necessary for one who has a break with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the thigh bone or the upper arm or similar, that they be bled immediately, as the bloodlettings we have mentioned testify.
And if the wound bleeds, stanch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the break in that same hour, or that day, if no hot swelling comes.
And if hot swelling comes, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the swelling has subsided, and do not touch it on the third day or the fourth, for you would cause bad complications.
And if the broken bone is visible above the exposed flesh, it is necessary that you set it gently with your hands, with little extension.
And if the extension is not ready for you to set evenly with your hands, then bring it back with this instrument which is of iron, which is 7 or 8 fingers long, and the width is according to the size of the wound; and for this the physician needs to take 3 or 4, according to what he needs in each treatment of breaks; and let it be round and a little thick, that it may not bend under compression on the limb during your work, and let it be sharp in front, and thick from the middle forward, thus:
And it is called a "lever," wherefore it is necessary that the curved head be placed on the head of the visible bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is even one against the other.
And if the break is subtle, and the instrument cannot well grasp the bone, it is necessary that you cut the head of the bone, until the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot bring back the bone, as we have said, cut it with an instrument suitable for this, either cutting tool or saw, according to your ability; then scrape what remains of roughness and small scales on the bone.
And when the bone is brought back, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
If you do so that it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it's in summer; and do not put on the wound any cerate or other thing containing oil, which might bring about rot and corruption; then apply splints when you have reset the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not bound together with the break; and many times foolish physicians have done this, and have brought upon the patient either death or sometimes corrosion; and let the binding be softer and gentler than with other breaks.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad symptoms might come, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you should not put splints on it; but wrap around, in place of splints, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after 1 or 2 days pus forming in the wound, remove what you have put on with the wine, and apply a healing ointment for wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, until it is welded and healed.
And the limb must be arranged in such a way that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but continues to discharge pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, for which you must probe the wound with a probe, and remove all these separated pieces that are causing that pain.
And if a fistula comes to the place, or another type of corruption, then you must treat it according to what is said in its chapter above.
And when the bone is broken and visible above the limb, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, and other similar large members, do not pull it out, for many times death comes from this, but leave it until it rots; perhaps it will fall out by itself after 20 or 30 days, then treat the wound if you can; and if you cannot, then leave it.
Concerning the lumps that come over the healing
These often come to us after the healing of the break, especially when it is near the joint, and the appearance of the limb is ugly to see; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care then if the lump is fresh: administer styptic medicines to it, such as aloe, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and combine them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and put them on the lump with tow, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; and then unbind it, and begin another, until the nodule is removed; or you press on it with a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings above the limbs; and if the nodule has already converted to hardness like stone, and it needs to be removed, then cut above it, and split the visible excess; or you scrape it with some razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
"Of the limb that is weak after healing"
When the bone fracture is restored, and afterwards the limb remains weak and thin, this happens for many reasons: of which one is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or due to excessive moisture; or due to too much movement, not at the right time; or because there is little blood in the body, thus it is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient eat, and make the body tender, until blood is multiplied in him; and administer a bath to him, and give him joy and happiness; then put weight on the limb, so that the weight draws great nourishment to it, and moisten it often with lukewarm water, until nourishment flows to the limb; and it returns to its natural shape.
"Of the twisted limb after healing"
When the limb is twisted after restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the form of the limb is ugly, yet it does not lose its natural function: do not believe the fools who say that one must break the limb anew, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land; and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death; however, if the nodes and twisting are fresh, they should be moistened with hot water, where softening herbs have been cooked, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things; and make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and make a plaster with it; or take fat figs, and grind them with pigeon dung, and similar medicines that reduce the joining.
And sometimes the node is removed by continuous and lengthy rubbing with moist hands.
And movement should be administered to the limb each hour.
And if the twisting is old and hardened, like stone, and it is necessary to remove it with iron, it must be cut to the bone, with a subtle cutting tool gently; and put care and attention in the cure.
Here begins the book of dislocations
Dislocation is when a joint comes out of its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When dislocation occurs to someone, it must be reduced immediately without delay.
Because if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it can only be put back in place with difficulty; therefore one should not move it when it is swollen: many times it causes spasms and other pains; nevertheless, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave it until the swelling has subsided; then moisten the limb with hot water and oil, then reduce it gently, and treat each limb as the treatment will come in its place.
And I have ordered the chapters of dislocations from the head to the feet.
of the mandibles
It rarely happens that both mandibles are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways: either they are slightly removed from their places, and softened a bit; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and saliva runs from the mouth which they cannot hold, nor can they close their mouth, and their tongue is involved with speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by itself in several situations.
And if it is complete and total, you must reduce it hastily, and not delay; and in such a way that the assistants hold the patient's head, and the physician puts his thumb of one of his hands in the root of the dislocation of the mandible inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on both sides; and the other fingers of the hands should be outside, to make it even; and command the patient to soften their mandibles, and move them in all directions.
And the physician should make it even, until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if it's both mandibles together, moisten them with hot water and oil, until you can reduce them easily; and do not delay the reduction, as we have said.
And when they are evenly reduced, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, put on cloths moistened in a cerote made of rose oil and wax, then bind it gently with soft bandages; and let the patient sleep on their back, and their head should be positioned between two cushions, so that they move it neither to the right nor to the left, nor should they force themselves to chew, but take light food, until the pains are removed, and the mandibles are knit together; and then let them eat what they want gently, and not strain themselves opening the mouth while eating and drinking, until the mandible is well knit and healed.
And if the two mandibles cannot be reset at once, and are not converted to their places, then fevers and customary sweating come, and perhaps looseness of bowels, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is destruction; and many times the one to whom it happens dies within nine days.
of the clavicle
The clavicle cannot dislocate from the inside side in its continuation with the chest, and it is sometimes dislocated to the outside, and one can feel it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies supine on their back, and extends their arms; and then press the place strongly with your palm, and it will return; then put on the plaster and the bandage, and tighten it; and the head which is toward the elbow cannot dislocate; if little, and if it dislocates sometimes, reduce it to its place, as we have said; then put on the plaster and the bandage, and tighten it, and command the patient to rest until they are healed; and in the same way is reduced the head of the shoulder, when it is separated from its place.
On the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is only dislocated in three ways: of which one is that it dislocates to the part of the armpit below; and the second is to the part of the chest; and by chance dislocates to the part above, and this happens rarely; and it does not dislocate backwards because of the shoulder blade, and does not dislocate inwards because of the nerves; and most often dislocates below towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in these it jumps out quickly; in those who have much flesh, it comes out with difficulty, and goes back in with difficulty.
And by chance it happens to some men percussion or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and one thinks that it is dislocated because of this.
It is therefore necessary that you examine it, until you are certain of it; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is down towards the armpit, and makes a difference between the sick shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find between them manifest diversity; and you will find at the head of the shoulder a hollow, and below the armpit to the touch the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any movements; and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it manifestly to the touch; and this manner of dislocation is not difficult to reduce, when it is recent, or if the patient is a child.
And the method is that the assistant raises the patient's hand up high, then put your thumbs under the armpit, and forcefully raise the joint up to its place; and the assistant raises the hand, and extends it upward, then puts it down; thus it will come back quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within several days after, it is necessary that the patient be bathed in hot water; and administer mollifying and soothing irrigation, such as decoction of marshmallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and let it be administered; then let the patient lie on his back, and put under the armpit an even roll of wool, neither too soft nor too hard, then let the physician put his heel on the roll, and strongly raise the head of the shoulder, and pull the patient's hand; and another assistant should hold the patient's head, so that it does not move downward; that shoulder comes back immediately, and if you wish you can reduce it according to this method: which is that you have present a man who is taller than the patient; and let him stand straight towards the side, and push his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and raise the armpit up, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another assistant pulls the patient's hand down towards the belly.
And if the patient is too light, then hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation returns immediately.
And one reduces it also in another way: which is that one fixes a long pole in the ground, whose head is as round as a pestle, and is neither too thick nor too thin; then let it be put under the patient, but let there be soft cloths on it, and let the patient stand along the length of the pole; then let his hand be strongly extended down on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly; and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a pole of two arms length and four fingers width, which has a round head to better enter deeply under the armpit, according to this form:
Then tie soft cloths on the head of the stick, so that the stick does not hurt the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit; and extend their arm along the stick lengthwise, and tie the upper arm to the stick, and the arm at the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder widthwise, and let the hand be extended downward, and let the body be left hanging on the other side: the joint goes back in immediately.
And when it is in, in whatever manner that may be, it is necessary that you put under the armpit an even ball of wool, then put the plaster prepared with mill powder, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then arrange it suitably under the armpit, and wrap the bandage over the plaster, and secure the hand to their neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And it is necessary that they eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster; and then eat more after 5 or 7 days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come there, or for another cause, it is necessary that you apply cauteries with 3 holes, as it is put forward in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it comes undone after 7 days, and the joint does not hold, and cannot raise the arm upward, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never again be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is toward the chest, and the breasts, or behind, is treated by pushing, and extending of hands, and one administers another binding; and treat until it is healed.
And if after the healing comes heaviness to the limb, and slowness in movement, let the patient use the bath many times, until that heaviness is lightened, and returns to its original nature.
On the dislocation of the elbow
Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated from all sides, and especially front and back, and the dislocation is not hidden, for one can see it well and feel it well; and it dislocates according to each configuration.
And when you join the sick elbow with the healthy one, you can see it clearly.
For the joint is hollow, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch their shoulder at all.
And it is necessary that you return it before hot swelling comes there, for if hot swelling came there, the return would be difficult; and perhaps it cannot be returned completely, especially when it is to the rear; it is worse than the other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps death comes.
And the restoration is thus, when it is such that one can return it, that you extend their hand with your two hands; and their arm should be spread out, and the hands of the physician around the elbow, above and below, and push the joint with their thumbs together, or with the base of their palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is to the front, it returns when they double their hand to their hand, and strike the dislocated elbow with the base of the palm.
And if it will not return to place, then administer strong extension; and it is that two attendants extend the arm, and two attendants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension; then turn the arm from each side, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth; and when the physician has joined the joint with their hand, then anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint strongly, until it returns; and when it is in place, then put on dry plaster with egg white, and bind it strongly, and hang the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, undo the binding, and leave it; and if you see that the joint does not hold well, restart the plaster and the binding, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set; then undo it.
And if he feels discomfort after the reduction of the joint, and it moves, bathe it and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or put on the joint a fat sheep's fleece, then leave it for a day and a night, then remove it, and make him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then put the fleece back on, and then enter the bath; and do this 2 or 3 times, until he is healed; and if you wish, put on moist cow dung heated with butter, and bind it on; thus it will return to its proper state.
The dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and the reduction is easier than other joints. However, it must be reduced to its place quickly, in the very hour that it is dislocated, before the place swells, or before a hot abscess comes.
And the reduction is done thus: that you put the sick hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and the physician puts it straight, such that he puts his palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns. However, you must look if it is well in place; then the patient puts the back of his hand on a table for the extension and reduction.
And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient puts the back of his hand on the table, and the physician puts his hand on this prominence of the joint.
If it returns immediately, that is good. If not, bind it with plasters that calm hot abscesses, and leave it thus without starting over.
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put it in place after some days, the joint remains twisted; and it harms the patient nothing except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grip anything at all: then know that the nerves are cut, or the artery; so there is no other device except to bind by cautery near the case, and perhaps nothing else will work.
And when the hand is in place, put on the plaster that we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it 5 days, then undo it and leave it thus.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some discomfort, moisten it with hot water, and rub it until he is healed.
About the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated to each side, sometimes to the back of the palm or to the palm; then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it toward the part where it is disjointed; and leave it 2 days, and then put it straight that day; and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and rebind it at night; and do this often, until it is tight, and do exactly the same if it is dislocated to the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed; and do exactly the same when it is dislocated to another part.
On the dislocation of the spine
When the spine of the back or neck is dislocated, or if there are multiple dislocations, there is no cure, for death hastens the patient.
And the signs are that excrement comes out without control, and cannot be held, and often some limbs are paralyzed, either both thighs or both arms or one. And often the spine moves in 4 directions; the one that moves backward is called "gibbosity": the treatment is that you observe if the gibbosity has come from childhood: if so there is no cure nor complete healing.
And for that which comes from falling or from blows or from similar things, the ancients spoke of methods of treatment with grand words, in which there isn't much profit overall; but I have abbreviated it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that for the gibbosity that comes to the chest in front, there is neither device nor cure; and also that which comes directly on both sides, and one cannot cure except specifically that which comes to the back, as I say; and it is that the patient should be stretched out on his face on a level place, and have straw beneath him, so he doesn't hurt himself; then fix one stake firmly in the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a band under the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles; and two assistants pull the bands, one at the head and the other at the feet, through the two stakes; and let the stakes be well secured, as we have said, and the physician puts his palms firmly on the spine, until it returns.
And if it doesn't return by this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and dig under the wall, and the patient should be on his side, and push the head of the board under the wall, then put the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician put his feet on the other end of the board, and press well, until it returns to place; and if you wish, do it with the windlass that turns by hand.
And it is that you fix two stakes at the patient's head one arm's length high, and toward the feet two others, and have between each stake, above and below, a palm's space in length; and have in each stake a hole, where the windlass runs, and let the stakes be firmly in the ground, so they don't move; and between each two stakes have one turning stake, on which the bands turn, and have in two turners two small stakes a palm long, to turn the windlass; and then tie the band that is through the armpits to the windlass toward the head, and the other band toward the feet to the other windlass, and each of the assistants turns his windlass with all the band, and the master puts the spine straight as we have said.
And when it is straight, put on it a drying plaster with egg white, and then the tow, and then the splint of a small board three fingers long, that covers the place of the gibbosity and the part of the healthy vertebra, then bind it with a band, as we have said, and let the patient use subtle nourishment, until he is healed; and if anything comes at the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned before; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the back vertebra of the spine, and one thinks that it is dislocation; and it is the bone that appears, wherefore one should not have presumption: by chance it would bring death.
On hip dislocations
Know that in the joints of the hip and shoulder joints there only occur dislocations, and not as in other joints; and the hip joint can be dislocated in four directions: inward and outward, and forward and backward; and more commonly inward than elsewhere, and rarely forward and backward.
And the signs of its dislocation inward are that when one joins the sick leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the sick knee appears larger than the healthy one, and the sick person cannot bend their knee to the fire; and the place beside it is swollen with hot inflammation, because the head of the thigh bone comes there.
And the sign of one whose dislocation is outward is that these symptoms are contrary to those mentioned before.
And the signs of one whose dislocation is forward are that they can extend their leg completely; however, they cannot bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make them walk, they cannot go forward, and they retain their urine, and the groin swells, and when they walk, they step on their heel.
And the signs of one whose dislocation is backward are that they cannot spread their knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh bone is in the place below the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you should check if the dislocation is old, and if it remains in its position, there is no cure; and one should not have presumption.
And in one whose dislocation is fresh, and it is one of the four types of dislocation, hasten to turn the joint, and stretch it inward and outward, and move it right and left; perhaps it will return, and needs no other treatment.
And if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare a strong assistant, and stretch the leg forcefully with two hands, or with a band that is tied above the knee; and another assistant should extend his hand above in such a way that he puts his hands under the armpits, then bind it with a gentle band above the thigh; and another should hold the end of the band; and they should all pull up and down at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This manner of extension is common to all four types, and if the dislocation is reduced, as we have said, that is good.
If not, then care must be given according to its type. When the dislocation is inward, you must lay the patient on their healthy side, then put the band at the root of the thigh, and the place below the groin, then extend the band upward toward the groin, and toward the collarbone; then another assistant should take his arms, and embrace the thick part of the sick thigh, and extend it outward strongly: it will return to its place immediately; and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot secure it in this manner that we have described, you must tie the two feet of the patient together with a strong gentle band above the two heels, and above the two knees, and let the sick leg be extended two fingers longer than the other; then let them be hung from the top of a pole, and be above the ground two arms' length; then command an assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who strongly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately hastily.
And when the dislocation is outward, the patient should lie down, as we have said for those with a hump, and tie a bandage above the affected leg specifically, and above the chest also; then place 2 poles, one at the head and another at the feet, then fix a pole between the patient's thighs in the middle of the frame; and have plenty of moist cloths around, so it doesn't hurt the patient, then each assistant should pull toward himself, and the physician should manually realign the dislocation.
If it returns [to place], that is good.
If not, place upon a table, and press as we have said for the hump, and have the patient lie on the healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, one must extend the affected leg hastily, and according to what I said; and the physician should take care to be above the affected joint, then press with the other hand, and extend downward toward the knee.
And if the dislocation is outward, one should not extend the patient downward, nor lift from the ground, rather one should proceed as if the hip was dislocated outward, as we have said about lying on both hips; and he should be on his face, and the bandages extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint with the table; and it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they are equal; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind with a bandage, so that the hip doesn't move; and rest for 3 or 4 days, then unbind it, and put the plaster on; and if you see they are equal, bind it, as before, and leave it 3 days; then unbind it, and make him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
On the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inward and outward, and backward; and does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you command the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it doesn't attach to his thigh, know that it is dislocated; and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit straight, and extend his leg if he can, and put your back on his face, and put his foot on your feet; then take his knee in your palms, and pull back between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he can easily attach his leg to his thigh; and put the plaster on, and make the leg attach to the thigh, and bind them together strongly for 3 or 4 days, then unbind it; and the patient should not exert himself walking until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not right, administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
On the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes moved, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inward and outward.
And the signs are that the ankle is swollen, and tends forward to the side where it is dislocated: the reduction is easy, and one should extend it gently with one's hands when it is only moved.
And when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright, and have a strong assistant hold him by the leg, above the ankle; then pull the foot toward you with your right hand, and then with the left hand two times, then extend it upward, and gently push the foot upward; and do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot; if it returns, that's good; if not, then begin the work again, for it will return; and if it cannot return this way, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly plant a stake in the ground between his thighs, and wrap cloths around it, so it doesn't hurt the patient; then have the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a band tied around the top of the foot; then each assistant should pull equally, and the stake should remain between the patient's thighs to hold him when they pull; then the physician should align the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant should hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, put the plaster and tow on it, and tighten it firmly, and bind the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves that are behind the ankle, that the binding is not too tight; then leave it for two or three days, and if the binding loosens, tighten it; then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient to walk for four days; and if he walks before this term, there is no certainty that it won't dislocate again.
And if hot swelling comes, it is necessary that you calm it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.
On the fingers
When the fingers are dislocated, it is necessary to gently extend them without effort, and this is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the top of the foot, it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a flat place or on a table upright, and put your foot on what appears of these joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns; and when it is even, and nothing appears, put a board with two ends under the sole of the foot, then tighten it firmly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and make him rest until he is healed.
On wound and dislocation together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies: so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, not bold; and use at the beginning things that calm hot swelling, and leave the patient in God's hand, if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, then return the limb to its place immediately, before the hot swelling comes; and when the limb is in place, then administer things that calm hot swelling, and treat the wound, as is necessary, with drying ointments; and if with the dislocation there is breakage, and small separated bones, then remove them, and do what we have said in simple diseases; and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, according to what I have said, for this serves you better according to your Creator, and for the safety of your soul and your body.
Amen
