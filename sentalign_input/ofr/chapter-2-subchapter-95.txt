of the common veins of the body
Of the veins from which one bleeds, there are thirty-one, of which sixteen are in the head, namely: two pulsating ones behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the tip of the nose; and the two jugular veins which are in the neck; and the two veins which are in the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins called "augeherich"; and two veins which are under the tongue. 
The veins that are commonly bled from are five in each arm: one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the lay people call it the "head vein"; and the middle one is called "faste", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it the "heart vein"; and the basilic vein is on the right side, and the lay people call it the "belly vein", and it is above the elbow, and it is the one that is bled, which appears clearly above the pulse.
And the salvatella is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches; and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the left ankle, and the second is the saphenous which is at the ankle of the right side; and the vein which is called "nesse", which is at the ankle of the other side; and in the other leg there are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with chronic catarrhs, and with migraines; and the method of bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then have the patient squeeze his neck with a screw, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging from the head: then search for them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, make a mark with ink; then take the lancet, and push it under the vein down to the bone, then raise your hand with the vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two finger-widths across, and let out as much blood as you see fit; then squeeze and tie it until it is healed; and I have already spoken of incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries which are in the two temples, is good for chronic and sudden migraines, and habitual ophthalmia, and for acute tearing of the eyes; and the method of bleeding is as I say: the patient should squeeze his neck, so that the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then mark with ink; then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and push the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need; then untie the patient, and put your finger on the vein for an hour, then put on cotton; and then tie it tightly, and leave it until it is healed; and we have already spoken of them and their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is worth as much as bleeding from the cephalic vein for chronic diseases of the face, and for migraines, and for redness; and the method is that the patient squeezes his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called a "digger", of which here is the form: 
And put the point on the vein, and strike it with your hand, or with something else, and let the blood flow out according to the quantity you want; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed; and sometimes it is done with a broad lancet.
However, the lancet should not be too sharp; and bleed across, because the bone is close, and perhaps the lancet will break if it is thin.
Bleeding from the two veins which are in the two tear ducts helps the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and stye in the eye, and diseases of the face; and the method of their bleeding is that the patient squeezes his neck by twisting with some sort of band, as before; then bleed him, and the bleeding should be across, a little along the length of a somewhat wide lancet, because there is no flesh there.
And if the lancet is thin, it might break; then let the blood flow as much as you need, and then tie cotton over it, and tie it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for fever, and sudden madness, and diseases of the face, such as migraine and redness that comes in the face, especially when it is chronic; and the method of bleeding is that the patient squeezes his neck, then holds his nose with your left hand, and take a thin long lancet, and insert it in the middle of the lip in the space between the two nostrils, because the vein doesn't show well down there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow; and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then tie it for a night, for it is very quickly restored; and this is the shape of the lancet:
Bleeding from the two jugular veins helps with shortness of breath, and the beginning of measles, and many illnesses, and impetigo, and herpes, and corroding ulcers; and the method of bleeding is that the patient squeezes his neck beneath each one, as we have said; and let the practitioner stand over the patient's head, and the patient sit on a seat, then bleed the vein lengthwise a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is needed; then do the same in the other vein, then untie the band, and squeeze both veins moderately, so that the patient does not strangle; and leave it until morning, so that the wound is healed.
of the bleeding of the lips
Bleeding from the veins of the upper lips helps with burning in the mouth, and infection of the gums, and chapped lips, and of the nose and around.
And the method of bleeding is to have the patient sit in front of you, and squeeze his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognized by the fact that they are black, and by the fact that around them are small black veins: then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, cut the largest on each side, and do the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
of the bleeding under the tongue
The bleeding of the veins that are under the tongue helps after the bleeding of the cephalic vein, and this is for tightness of the throat, and diseases of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth; and the way to bleed is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and lift the tongue, and look underneath on each side for a black vein: then bleed one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries. 
The veins of the neck that are commonly bled are bled in two ways: either by pricking with a myrtle-leaf-shaped lancet, or a thin olive-shaped lancet like a cutting edge, and it is called "anesil"; and they are wide and narrow depending on the width and narrowness of the veins.
The myrtle-leaf shaped lancet is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is needed for opening hairy veins full of thick, apparent blood, and that contain thick and cloudy blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped lancet:
and it is more finely pointed, and is for bleeding thin veins, where there is thin, clear blood.
Bleeding the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly; and the bleeder must bleed wisely, and beware of the artery that is underneath.
And if he cuts the artery, and bleeding occurs, it must be stopped, as I have said; and the lancet should not be piercing, but cutting like a razor.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, you must compress it and choose another; or you seek a branch of it, or you bleed instead the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut it with the razor lancet, as we have said. 
And if you want to know the location for the bleeding, you must, before you tighten the arm, touch the area until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the razor lancet; and be careful not to strike the artery when you see the area swollen, for that is the artery: avoid it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: hurry then, and put your finger over it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; then tie the arm, and leave it like that, and let the patient not move it; and let him be wary, and not move it until he is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and the medicine is not at hand, cut the artery if it appears, for the ends of it retract; and the blood will stop.
And take a bark of fustic, and split it, and take one of the halves and tie it on tightly until the next day; if the blood stops, it is good; if not, treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood; and the stopping of bleeding is not difficult in most cases because of the small size of the wound, and the pressure of the bandage on the arm.
Bleeding from the median vein helps because it draws blood from the head above, and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said; and the bloodletter must beware of the nerve that is underneath, and if he pricks too deep, and finds the nerve, and it swells and the healing is difficult, and perhaps it cannot heal; and this nerve appears often, and if it does not appear in some men because of its thinness, you must bleed it with the lancet instrument; and avoid the nerve as much as you can.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, split it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes; and it should be bled by pricking at the olive-shaped swelling or the myrtle-shaped swelling, for it is the safest of all the veins, because it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it.
However, one must look for the easiest place, and it doesn't matter if one misses the first time, and starts again; and perhaps the place swells in some men, when one misses the first time, but it doesn't matter.
The quality of the bleeding depends on your judgment.
The first thing you must know about bleeding is that bleeding is administered only to maintain health, and to avoid future illnesses; and the bleeding should be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow: namely, the cephalic, median cubital, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring while fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of plethora appear; and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
Bleeding administered for illnesses has no fixed time, but only when needed, day or night, at all hours and at all times; and children under fourteen years of age should not be bled, nor should pregnant women except from the fourth month until the seventh.
The elderly who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner, it is necessary that they cleanse the intestines with a light enema, if they have a lot of retained feces, so that the veins do not draw putrid superfluities from the intestines, harmful to the principal members; nor should one bleed someone who is too satiated with food, nor who is drunk, until they are sober, nor the dropsical; and one should beware of bleeding after colic, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse with a woman, and from work, from staying awake and fasting, and that which weakens all strength, either by something of the mind or of the body; then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, by foods and drinks and by medicines, if you have the power; then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the worst vein around the third hour, as we have said; and guard yourself that day from work, and from exertion, and from sexual activity, and similar things; and be happy and joyful, and let the bleeder be higher than the one being bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature above moderately, because when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow; and then let him rub the place with his hands, until the veins swell, and they can be felt; then let the bleeder moisten the lancet with a little old oil, then place the finger of his left hand on that vein below the place a little where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail upon being lanced.
For there are veins that flee like cords when bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when the lancet is placed on them, it retracts from the lancet, and the vein cannot be opened, and thus it is with these; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be knowledgeable in these things. 
And if the vein opens the first time, that's good; if not, then try again a little below that spot or quickly above, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it for a day or two, and do not tie the arm: perhaps hot abscesses will come there; do not enter the bath, then try the bleeding again if it pleases them; and if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly and you doubt that not as much blood will come out as you want, then strike into that same opening with the whole lancet straight; and open it a little quickly, before the place swells; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swelling, do not restart the bleeding, and apply a little oil dregs, for it lightens the body of blood, and the dregs are better in this place than the oil; and thus administer the oil dregs in every bleeding that you bleed the veins, to stop the flow of blood; and the same is done with theriac and ox dung, when it is placed on the spot; thus the blood thins and spreads when it is too thick. 
And if a large abscess develops there, which happens often, especially when it is not bled except at that time or the opening of the vein is small, then hurry, and apply a sponge moistened in slightly warm water and salt to the place, and squeeze it for an hour; and you must do this after the blood has flowed from the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains at the place after a few days, it does not harm it; and if you wish, apply something of aloes or myrrh mixed with juice of calamint, wild mint, or similar.
And often an abscess and swelling occur with the bleeding of the basilic vein: then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft when pressed by the hand, then this swelling is bad.
Therefore, be careful not to apply anything of what we have said, for perhaps blood flows from the artery; but make a dry plaster for him to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw blood from each one according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool down.
And for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, a larger wound should be made, and the lancet be wide; and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should be bled little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking; and this manner of bleeding is safe from excessive bleeding and cutting of a nerve, and is better than bleeding along the length or width.
And to the one whose body faints during bleeding, give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is heated, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of a cold complexion, before bleeding, have him eat bread soaked in syrup of muscat, or in syrup of aromatic honey with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a very fragrant syrup. 
And if he faints during bleeding, after the release of much blood, he should drink meat broth, and a delicate fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have mentioned in the section or chapter on syncope, concerning the opening of a vein.
And if he wishes to empty his arm, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by much bleeding, that he bleeds little by little, according to the amount of his strength, continuously.
And whoever wants to empty his arm after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, should do so the second or third day.
For there is much blood inside the body which is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a large quantity, and enlarge the opening until he falls in a faint; then you must observe all the conditions of bleeding, and put your hand on his pulse while he bleeds, so that death does not come instead of fainting, and this happens many times, when the bloodletter is negligent; and it is not necessary when you want to untie the arm, and let blood flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly on it; nor if it is bent, that he extends the arm hastily, for that would be bad; but leave it until he bleeds a second time; or prick it with the point of the lancet, so that the blood that is congealed at the opening of the vein comes out, and put on a little salt dissolved in water, and press lightly on it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it, until the swelling has subsided.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, bleed him in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled instead of the vein of the head because it is well-formed/suitable.
And the method of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in hot water, until the skin is red; then it should be tied moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed immediately across, not lengthwise nor along the length; and let the opening be wide, and be bled very close to the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in hot water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough; and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back in hot water, for it is put there more in winter than in summer; and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein of the right hand is good for all diseases of the liver, and this is the method: clench the hand, and put it in hot water, until the vein is swollen, so that it can be seen; and bleed it across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm; and do not go too deep, because the nerves are underneath, bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in hot water, if the blood has congealed in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and salt on the vein to heal it quickly, and do this for every branch/vein.
Bleeding from it in the left hand is good for diseases of the spleen, and do just as I told you for the right.
Bleeding from the saphenous vein is good for all illnesses that are below the body, such as illnesses of the marrow, and retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and of the thighs and of old legs, and similar illnesses.
And the way to bleed it is that the patient puts his foot in hot water, and rubs the vein until it appears, and ties above the ankle joint; and the vein is at the ankle, and many branches go above the foot; then bleed it in the largest branch, or at the ankle, which is better.
And if you bleed it on the foot, beware of the nerves that are underneath, and bleed it across as if cutting; and let the lancet be sharp.
And if the blood cannot come out, put the foot back in the water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeder misses the first time, try again a second time a little above, because the place is safe; do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and bleeding it is good for hip pain, when it's due to hot blood.
And the way to bleed it is that the patient enters the bath, and squeezes above the ankle with four fingers while twisting, because otherwise the vein does not appear; and if it appears, bleed it in every way you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very deep in many people.
And if you do not find it, bleed any small vein of it that appears on the top of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves; and let as much blood flow as you want, and then untie the ligature, and put on cotton and tighten it; it is now bled.
