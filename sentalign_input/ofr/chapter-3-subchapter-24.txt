of the mandibles (jawbones)
It rarely happens that both mandibles (jawbones) are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is in two ways:
either they are slightly out of their places, and slightly softened;
or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and saliva runs from the mouth which he cannot hold, nor can he close his mouth, and he mumbles his speech with his tongue.
When the dislocation is minor, it returns by itself in most cases.
And if it is complete and full, then you must reduce it quickly, and do not delay;
and in such a way that the assistant holds the patient's head, and the physician puts the thumb of one of his hands at the root of the jaw's dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on both sides;
and the other fingers of the hands should be outside, to apply even pressure;
and instruct the patient to relax his jaws and move them in all directions.
And the physician sets it evenly, until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then moisten them with hot water and oil, until you can reduce them easily;
and do not delay the reduction, as we have said.
And when they are reduced evenly, and the patient's mouth closes well without difficulty, then apply cloths soaked in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and the patient should sleep on their back, with their head placed between two cushions, so that they do not move it to the right or left, and do not try to chew, but take light food, until the pain is gone, and the jaws are healed;
and then they can chew what they want lightly, and not strain to open their mouth when eating and drinking, until the jaw is well healed and healthy.
And if the two jawbones cannot be reset at once, and are not returned to their places, fevers and sudden illnesses may occur, and possibly diarrhea, and perhaps vomiting pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal;
and many times the one to whom it happens dies within nine days.
