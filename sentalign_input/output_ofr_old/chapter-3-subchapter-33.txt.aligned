of the dislocation of the heel	On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.	0.51851606
The heel is sometimes sprained, and sometimes fully dislocated, both inwards and outwards.	The ankle is sometimes slightly displaced, sometimes fully dislocated, the dislocation being either internal or external.	0.8651607
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and leans forward on the side where it is dislocated: the reduction is easy, and one should extend it gently with their hands when it is only sprained.	The sign of its dislocation is that you will see the ankle swollen, and projecting on the side to which it is dislocated. As to the treatment of its displacement, the reduction of it is easy: if it is gently extended with the hands and straightened, it will go back.	0.8457961
And when it is in place, apply the plaster and padding on it, and bandage it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and be careful of the nerves that are on the ankle behind, that the bandage is not too tight; then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage loosens, tighten it; then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.	Then when the dislocation is reduced and the soundness of the reduction is manifested to you, apply a plaster and packing, bandage firmly and bind the foot downwards. You will have to be careful of the tendon above the ankle at the back, not to bandage tightly over it so as to injure it. Then leave him for two or three days; and if the binding works loose, tighten it up. Then on the third or fourth day loosen it, but the patient is to abstain from walking for forty days, for if he tries to walk before this lapse of time you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not collapse and corruption set in and thereafter be incurable.	0.92457485
And if a hot abscess develops there, you must treat it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.	If an abscess occur you must allay it by the application of such dressings and embrocations as we have already described more than once, until it is gone.	0.57226557
