Chapter XXII
On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly and inhibit their proper function.
When it happens that a healed limb becomes crooked or prominent at the broken bone and swelling, and the shape of the limb is thus altered, but the limb is not inhibited from its natural function, you should not take the word of someone who thinks the limb is newly broken.
But there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land; and this operation is very blameworthy, causing great fear, the sign of which is deadly.
But if the crookedness and swelling are recent, then they should be treated with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, mallow, and similar ones; and a poultice should be made with a softening plaster like well-made dyallachilon; or marshmallow root mucilage mixed with hen's fat or cerate oil, and applied as a plaster; or fatty figs mashed with pigeon dung, and similar medicinal substances that are named for consolidating.
And sometimes it is resolved with frequent gentle rubbing with wet hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.
But if the crookedness has advanced and become hard and turned into a bony mass, and it needs surgical treatment, then the top layer must be scraped off and the continuity of the bone disrupted, and the excess swelling of the bone itself should be incised with fine instruments, and this should be done with care and diligence.
