Chapter Fifty-One.
On the excision of warts that appear on the abdomen.
Often, many people have warts on their abdomens and on other parts of their bodies. These warts are called "fungating" because they resemble mushrooms: their stalks are thin and their heads thick, and their lips are transformed. Some of them are small, and some become very large.
I have seen a man with two warts on his abdomen that were very similar to mushrooms, no difference, white with thin stalks and transformed, cracked lips, from which moisture constantly seeped. I excised them, and the weight of one was about eighteen ounces, and the other about six ounces.
The procedure for excising them is as follows: observe; if the patient has a moist humor, and if the wart is white, moist, and thin-stalked, then excise it with a wide scalpel. Have cauteries ready in the fire, because often much blood gushes out when they are excised.
Therefore, be prepared, and if the bleeding overwhelms you, cauterize it.  If you see that the patient is cowardly and frightened of being cut with iron, then take a strong lead thread and tightly tie it around the wart that has these characteristics. Leave it for two days, then tighten the lead thread further, and continue tightening the lead thread.
Do this every time it affects the wart until it is severed and falls off by itself without trouble. If the wart has a thick stalk, there is some danger and risk in excising it, especially those on the abdomen. However, it may be possible to excise half of it or part of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of attempting to excise a wart that is dark in color, minimally sensitive, and has an unpleasant appearance, for it is a cancerous tumor, and we will discuss cancer after this.
