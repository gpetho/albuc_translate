About migraine
When a chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of tears and heat in the temples and an old persistent headache and similar things, and it is treated by medical treatments and none of it helps, then we extract the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have explained.
And the manner of their extraction is that the patient pulls back the hair of his temples, and feels for the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is slightly hidden except in some men who are very cold; and if it is hidden, then the patient tightens his neck with some cloths, then rubs the area with some rough cloth, and sprinkles the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula, which is of this form:
then lightly cut the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it up with pincers, and separate it well from the tissues that are beneath it on each side; and if the artery is thin, then turn it with the point of a hook, then cut it from that part according to the amount of the two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood does not spurt out completely.
And draw out six cups of blood, up to three; and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no rot comes before the healing of the wound, and the flow of blood stops; then cut the excess that is between the two ties at that very hour, and then, if you want, cauterize it with a knife cautery to the bone until the heads are cut; and this is the best procedure, if the patient does not have a fever and he is of a hot complexion.
For the cautery helps to end the moisture: therefore it is of greater help for the moisture.
Or, for the extraction of the arteries, one must fill the area with old cotton and place well-made tents on top; and when you untie them, treat them with dry medicines that make flesh grow, and with tents, until it is healed; and if blood runs from the artery while you are working, quickly stop it with cautery, or fill the area with vitriol and press it with your hand so that the blood stops; and if you do not have this on hand, place your finger on the spot until the blood clots, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the blood stops, and press as necessary; and the best and easiest method for extracting the artery is to cauterize the vein with a cutting cautery on both sides, but the cuts should be thick to retain their heat longer.
For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less.
And there should be a finger's width of thickness between the two knives, and then when you have marked the two spots, place the burning iron on them until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and let there be a distance between the two heads because it is not entirely closed by this cautery; and this is the form of the cautery:
