On the method of cauterizing the spleen. Chapter 32.
When you treat a disease of the spleen with the treatments we discussed in the division of diseases, and it does not yield to these treatments, cautery can be used in three ways, all of which are effective.
One method is to create three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen, in the same manner as the cauteries for the liver, as we previously described.
Let the space between each cautery be about the thickness of a finger, or a little more.
Let the method of the cautery be exactly as we described in cauterizing the liver.
Do not press your hand hard with the cautery, and have the patient lying on his back.
Another method of cauterization is to heat a double-pronged cautery, as we discussed in the chapter on shoulder dislocation; lift the skin directly over the spleen, where the patient’s left elbow reaches, lifting it along the body’s width, so the cauteries fall along the body’s length.
Then insert the two highly heated prongs until they pierce through to the other side of the skin; then remove the cautery, creating four cauteries.
If you wish, you may cauterize with another cautery that has three prongs.
Then care for the cautery site, allowing it to discharge pus over many days, as it is more effective than other preceding treatments.
