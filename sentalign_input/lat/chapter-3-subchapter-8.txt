Â¶ On the restoration of ribs when they are fractured.
Chapter IX.
Know that fractures of the ribs only occur in thick areas that follow the back, and at their ends on the front side.
And they do not suffer attrition, except because they are cartilaginous.
And its detection is not hidden from the senses upon examination with the fingers.
And its restoration is done by aligning the fracture with the fingers in the best possible way until the shape is even, as it should be.
Then apply plasters, and secure the broken bone with a splint, if it needs one.
And if the rib fracture is inclined inward, the patient experiences severe pain and stabbing, like that which occurs in one who has pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane, and he also suffers from difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting a lot of blood: and this is difficult to treat.
The ancients have already devised many methods for this: and some of them say to give the patient foods that generate inflammation and bloating, so that the abdomen swells, expands, and pushes the fracture outward.
However, we avoid this, so as not to quickly cause a hot abscess if it has not already happened.
But if it has already happened, then increase it.
And some of them said: place a cupping glass on the site, then draw with strength, and this is more reasonable.
However, it is feared that the cupping glass may draw excess fluids to the site, due to the weakened condition.
And some of them said: the site should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil, and cushions should be placed between the ribs until they are filled, so that the binding is even when you wrap it around.
Then the patient should be treated as for pleurisy with food and medicine.
But if a severe condition arises that the patient cannot bear, and the bone pierces the membrane with an injurious prick, and we fear for the patient, then we must cut above the site and expose the fractured rib.
Then place on it the instrument that preserves the tissue, previously mentioned: and cut the bone with ease, and remove it.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture: and treat it with plasters until it heals.
If a hot abscess arises in the meantime, then act quickly, soak cushions in rose oil, and place them on the site: and treat the patient with what is suitable for the abscess.
Meanwhile, let him also lie on the side on which he sleeps, until he heals.
