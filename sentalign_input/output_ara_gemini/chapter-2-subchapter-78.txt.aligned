If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in rose oil or marshmallow extract, then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta. If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it gently, little by little, until it comes out.	But if, after this treatment, it still remains and does not come out, then tell the midwife to dip her hand in oil of sesame or mucilage of marshmallow and introduce it into the vulva and search for the afterbirth, and when she has found it, to take hold of it and very gently draw it until she bring it out.	0.8580401
If it is adhered deep in the uterus, insert the hand as we described until you find the placenta. Then pull it gently, little by little, taking care lest the uterus prolapses with strong pulling. Rather, it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then increase the pulling force; it will then respond and detach from the adhesion.	But if it be adherent to the depths of the uterus, then let her pass her hand in as we described until she find the afterbirth; then let her draw very slowly and gently lest by violent pulling she cause a prolapse; and she should slowly move it from side to side, left and right; then let her increase the traction, for then it gives way to the pull and is freed from its adhesions.	0.8365841
