On the incision for worms generated under the skin, and it is called the disease of cattle.	On incision for the worm arising beneath the skin, called 'the cattle disease'.	0.882436
This disease is called in some of our countries the disease of cattle because it often happens to cattle, and it is a single small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh and creeps throughout the whole body, ascending and descending.	This complaint is called by us in some regions 'the cattle disease' since it frequently happens to cattle. It is in fact a small solitary worm generated between the skin and the flesh, that creeps all over the body, both up and down; it can be felt as it creeps from one part to another until it breaks out at a place where it can break through the skin, and out it comes.	0.8574127
It is perceptible to the senses when it creeps from one organ to another until it pierces wherever it pierces a place in the skin and emerges.  Its formation is from the putrefaction of some humors, as happens with worms and snakes and pumpkin seeds in the abdomen.	It arises from the putrefaction of certain humours as do worms, round-worms and gourd-worms in the abdomen.	0.51735306
The harm expected from it is that if it creeps in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may perhaps open it and come out, thus destroying the eye, and this happens often. So if you want to treat it and remove it, this is only possible when it creeps and its appearance is perceptible to the senses.	Part of the harm that may be expected of it is that when it creeps about the body and goes up to the head and reaches the eye it may make an opening in the eye and come out and destroy the eye; this frequently happens. If you wish to treat this and extract it, it must be done while it is creeping about and can be felt.	0.90269166
It is necessary that you tightly bind above it and below it with a good, tight ligature, then incise upon it and take it out. If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply cautery with fire to the place until you burn it.  The greatest harm expected from it is the destruction of the eye, as we have said.	You must tie a tight tourniquet above and below it, then cut down upon it and extract it. But if it burrows into the tissues and you cannot locate it, then apply the actual cautery to the place until you have burnt the worm. The greatest damage to be feared from it is damage to the eye, as we have said.	0.8364621
If you see that it has gone into the head near the eye, then bind tightly below it on the forehead, then incise upon it and take it out.  It is necessary that the patient attends to purifying his body with medications that purge putrid, bad humors and be careful of foods that generate putrefaction.	So if you see that it has entered the head and is near the eye, then bind a strong bandage over the forehead beneath it, then cut down upon it and draw it out. It is important also for the patient to take care to cleanse his body with laxative medicines from all corrupt and evil humours. He should also avoid all foods giving rise to putrefaction.	0.86874783
