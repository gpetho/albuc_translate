Dislocations of the hip
Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations occur, and they do not occur as in other joints; and the hip joint is dislocated in four directions: inwards and outwards, and forwards and backwards; and more inwards than elsewhere, and rarely dislocates forwards and backwards.
And the sign of its inward dislocation is that when the injured leg is compared with the healthy one, it is longer, and the patient's knee appears more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their knee towards the buttock; and the place nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the femur goes there.
And the sign of the one that goes outwards, is that the symptoms are opposite to the previous ones.
And the signs of the one that goes forwards is that they extend their leg fully; however, they do not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make them walk, they cannot go forward, and they retain their urine, and the groin swells, and when they walk, they step on their heel.
And the signs of the one that goes backwards is that they cannot extend or bend their knee, and that leg is more crooked than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is located beneath the ribs.
The reduction of this type of dislocation is as follows: you consider if the dislocation is old, and it remains fixed in its position, there is no cure; and one should not be presumptuous.
And in the one whose dislocation is fresh, and it is of the four types of dislocation, hurry to turn the joint, and stretch it inwards and outwards, and move it right and left; perhaps it will return, and no other treatment will be necessary.
And if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare a strong assistant, and strongly extend the leg with two hands, or with a strap tied above the knee; and another assistant extends their hand from above in such a way that they place their hands under the armpits, then gently tighten a strap on the thigh; and another holds the end of the strap; and they all pull upwards and downwards at the same time, until the patient is lifted from the ground all at once, and hangs suspended.
This method of extension is common to the four types, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, that is good.
If not, then a treatment specific to its type must be applied. When the dislocation is inwards, you should lay the patient on their healthy side, then place the strap on the top of the thigh, and the place that is below the groin, then stretch the strap upwards towards the groin, and towards the cleft; then another assistant takes their arms, and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh, and extends it outwards strongly: it will return to its place immediately; and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot reduce it in this way that we have described, you must tie the patient's two feet together with a strong, soft strap above both heels, and above both knees, and the injured leg should be extended two fingers' breadth more than the other; then it should be hung from the end of a wooden beam, and be two arm-lengths above the ground; then instruct an assistant to embrace the top of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint will return to its place quickly and immediately. 
And when the dislocation is outwards, the patient lies as we have described for the one with a gibbosity, and tighten a strap securely on the affected leg, and on the foot also; then place two sticks, one at the head and the other at the feet, then insert a stick between the patient's thighs in the middle of the buttocks; and have damp cloths placed around, so that it does not injure the patient, then each assistant extends towards themselves, and the surgeon replaces the dislocation with their hand.
If it returns (to its place), that is good.
If not, place (him) on a table, and press as we have described for the gibbosity, and the patient lies on their healthy side. 
And when the dislocation is forwards, it is necessary to extend the injured leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and the surgeon puts their effort on the injured groin, then presses with the other hand, and extends it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is outwards, it is not necessary to extend the patient downwards, nor raise them above the ground, but rather they should be as if the hip were dislocated outwards, as we have described for lying on both hips; and be on their face, and the strap extended as we have said previously, and one should press on the joint at the table; and it will be correct when the patient extends their legs, and they are even; then bring the thighs together, and apply the plaster, and secure it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and put the plaster on; and if you see that they are even, then tighten it, as before, and leave it for three days; then unbind it, and have them walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
