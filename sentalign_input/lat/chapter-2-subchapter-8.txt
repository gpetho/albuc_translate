Â¶ On the Treatment of Altheli of the Eyelids.
Chapter VIII.
The "Altheli" that occur on the eyelids sometimes are moist, and sometimes they are dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or a hook and cut them out with a spatula from their roots.
Then apply finely ground sage to the affected areas.
If they bleed, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
It is better to cauterize them after incision.
For they often return when some of their roots remain.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
