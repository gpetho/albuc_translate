of the wateriness of the eyes
When water first comes to the eyes by the signs I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that will cleanse the head, and keep him away from all moistures, and make him sweat or bathe several times while fasting.
Afterward command him to shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is in both eyes together, or in one if the descent is in one; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the core, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple; and beware of bleeding, and if you see too much blood flowing, then stop it with whatever power you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision how you will stop it; and sometimes a cautery is made in the hinder part below the two bones at the back.
