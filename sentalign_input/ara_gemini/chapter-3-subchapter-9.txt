The ninth chapter on the mending of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture occurs in them – and this rarely happens to them, what happens most often is a bruise, and likewise the vertebrae of the back as well – if that happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not, look: if you see that his hands have become limp, numb, and dead, and he is unable to move them, or stretch them, or grasp with them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle, he does not feel it and does not find any pain in them, then know that he will not recover in most cases, he is doomed.
And if he moves them and feels the pinch and the pricking in them, then know that the bone marrow is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.
If something similar happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you want to know whether he will also recover or not, look at his legs.  If you see that they have become limp and what happened to the hands has also happened to them, then if he lies on his back, wind and stool come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is doomed, so do not bother with his treatment.
If none of this happens to him, the matter is less severe.
And the treatment for what happened is that you try to soothe the hot swelling by placing rose oil alone, or with roasted egg whites, on the bruised vertebra.  Apply this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the area one of the strengthening, drying bandages and tighten it with a bandage. Order him to rest and stay still, and not to sleep except on the side where he feels no pain until he recovers.
If a splinter or something has occurred in the bone during the bruise, from which pus has come out, then it is necessary to cut the skin over it and extract that bone. Then bring the edges of the wound together, if it is large, with stitching, then treat it with healing ointments until it recovers.
If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the tailbone, is broken, it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus and straighten the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and as straightening allows. Then apply a bandage and a splint if needed, and then tighten it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, cut over it and extract it, and treat the wound with the treatment mentioned previously until it heals.
