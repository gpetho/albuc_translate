Of the fracture of the arm	On setting a fracture of the forearm.	0.48882365
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "fosciles," one of which is small, and it follows the thumb; and the other is large, and it is underneath, towards the little finger; by chance the large foscile alone fractures, or the small one, and by chance both together.	The forearm consists of two bones and is sometimes called 'the two firesticks'. One of these bones is small and is in line with the thumb, the other is large; this is the one placed lower, under the smaller one.	0.84179485
When the small foscile is fractured, the restoration is easy, and the healing; and when the large one is fractured, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are fractured together. If it is the small foscile that is fractured alone, then it needs to be lightly stretched, and set evenly.	The larger alone may be broken, or the smaller alone, or both broken together. When the small upper bone (radius) is broken it is easy to set and its mending is rapid. When the lower bone (ulna) breaks it is bad and its mending is difficult.	0.7882514
And if it is the large foscile, then it needs to be bound more strongly; and extend it on a cushion, and hold the thumb higher than the others, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be crossed on himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient does not suffer any strain; then the assistant stretches his arm to the part below with his hand, or with a strap, and another assistant to the other part above. And then the physician sets it evenly, according to its best shape.	During setting and extension the hand must be disposed on a cushion, spread out with the thumb uppermost, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger downmost, while the patient sits cross-legged upon the floor. The cushion should be on a level with him so that he does not suffer discomfort. Then let an attendant extend the arm from below, either by hand or by means of a band, while another attendant extends it from above similarly. Then the doctor may straighten the bone so as to restore it to the best possible shape.	0.85033727
And if the fracture has pieces, then place each one in its place, and if any are dislocated that pierce the flesh, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut above it and remove it, as we said before.	If there be any splinters in the fracture he must do his utmost to restore each splinter to its place. If a detached splinter appears there and is piercing the skin and you have no hope of restoring it, cut down upon it and remove it in the manner we have mentioned earlier.	0.7650904
And if the fracture is with a wound, I have spoken about it in the specific chapter; so take the treatment.	If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, we have devoted a separate section to this, so take the treatment of it from there.	0.7590369
And if a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of the restoration, then glue a cloth with a plaster made of rose oil and white wax, that is neither too hard nor too soft; and bind a cloth above subtly, until the hot abscess is soothed. And then remove the plaster, and apply the poultice made of mill powder with egg yolk, then place the splints, and the splint of the fracture should always be stronger, and a little wider than the others; and know that it should have six splints on the arm in various positions: whether the fracture is in one bone, or in both; and bind more on the fracture than elsewhere, and always less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and the cloths on the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and the thread, with which it is bound, should be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we said. And observe the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accidents happen to the limb, like itching that comes to the limb, then you need to moisten the limb with warm water, until the itching is soothed; and let the limb rest, not tightly bound. And then start the binding again, and if the binding is loosened and the bone dislocated, and similar things, then adjust it.	The dressings wound round the fracture should be gentle and soft, not very hard, while the cord for binding is best made of linen of medium thickness as we have prescribed. Some days later, examine the limb and the bandaging and if anything has happened that should be put right, such as pruritus in the limb, the limb should be bathed in warm water until the pruritus has subsided. Let the limb be unbandaged for one night so that he may rest, then put the bandage on again. If the bandaging has become loose and the bone has shifted or anything of that sort, correct it all diligently.	0.75928855
And if you see that nourishment cannot come to the limb, because it is too tight, then you need to loosen it a little, and leave it so for a few days, until nourishment flows there, and then bind it again.	Look also to see if nourishment is being prevented from reaching the part on account of over-bandaging, in which case you will have to loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it; then bind it up.	0.7556288
And if none of these things we mentioned happen to the patient, then do not unbind it for twenty days or around that time, then hang the hands to their neck, and the neck should be even, and avoid movement and dislocation, and sleep on their back; and know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or thirty-five, and sometimes in twenty days, depending on the composition and complexion of the strengths.	But if none of those things that we have mentioned happens to the patient, it should not be loosened until after about twenty days. Then the patient's hand is to be suspended from his neck, the arm being level, and he should guard carefully against agitated movements, and should sleep on his back. You should know that this fracture of the arm mends in thirty or thirty-two days, and sometimes in twenty-eight, depending on the individual's constitution and the condition of his strength.	0.8931636
