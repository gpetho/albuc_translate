When any abscess is slow to mature, either because of excess causing it, the patient's old age, their decrepit state, low blood, or the weather, and you want to hasten its maturation, then cauterize around it with many small puncturing cauteries; then leave it as it will hasten the maturation.	When a person gets a boil which is slow in coming to a head, either because of the superfluity causing it, or because of the patient's age if he be an elderly man lacking in blood, or because of the season, and you wish to hasten the ripening of the boil, then make a punctate burn around it with multiple small cauterizations, and then let be; it will speedily come to a head.	0.8122866
But if you want to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery in this shape: place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the skin.	If you wish to perforate it with cauterization, heat the cautery of this type. Apply it to the middle of the boil till it has pierced the skin.	0.7117621
