On the Fracture of the Kneecap.	On setting a fracture of the patella of the knee.	0.6916188
The kneecap rarely experiences a fracture, but it may often suffer a contusion. If it does experience a fracture, it will be either a fissure or fragmentation into pieces.  This may occur with or without a wound.	You should know that the patella is rarely fractured, but crushing often occurs. If a fracture does happen to it, it will be either a splitting or a shattering which may be simple or compound; and all these can be palpated.	0.81287384
You determine all of this by touch, and treat it by aligning any separated fragments with your fingers until they are joined and matched as well as alignment, gentleness, and skill allow. Then apply the bandage and, if necessary, a rounded splint over it.	Now the way to set is for the separated parts of it to be put right with the fingers, so that they unite and join as far as straightening and gentleness and skill can serve. Then apply the plaster and put upon that a circular splint, if need be, and over that a suitable bandage.	0.8348415
Apply appropriate bandaging over it. Then attend to all the conditions we have described for other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, by addressing each symptom appropriately until it heals.	Then keep an eye on it for all the conditions described for the other fractures, such as an effusion and the like, meeting whatever arises with what is good for it, until it is healed.	0.7830598
