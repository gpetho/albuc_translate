On the method of cauterizing in cases of melancholy.
Chapter XII.
When melancholy arises from corrupted humors and thick phlegm, apply cauteries as described for paralysis.
If melancholy is caused by an excess leading to melancholic conditions and the patient's body is moist, then give him a drink to purify the brain as described earlier; then shave his head and make a linen band like a small ring.
Place it on the center of the head, and have the patient sit in a stable, upright position held on all sides.
Next, prepare a liniment.
This is best made from aged sheepâ€™s butter.
Warm it gently over a fire to a temperature that a finger can comfortably withstand when dipped in.
Then pour it onto the middle of the head in the ring, and leave it until it cools.
Repeat this treatment once weekly, in combination with a proper regimen, until he is healed.
Alternatively, if desired, cauterize the patient by making numerous small punctures, carefully managing the cautery, ideally with a light touch.
This form of cautery moistens the brain beneficially.
Then apply a pad soaked in butter or chicken fat.
