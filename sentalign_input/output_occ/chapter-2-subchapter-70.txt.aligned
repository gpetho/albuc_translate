Hermaphroditism in men is in two ways: one is when it appears in the space in the covering of the testicles, in that between the two testicles there is a figure like a female vulva in which there is hair.	There are two kinds of male hermaphrodite: one has the appearance as of female pudenda with hair in the region of the perineum; the other has the same in the skin of the scrotum between the testes.	0.81615967
And sometimes from it flows urine which is in the covering of the testicles.	Sometimes also urine is excreted through that which is in the skin of the scrotum.	0.7683376
But in women it is one type: and it is that the vulva of the woman above the pubis is like two testicles of a man a little extending outward like the foreskin of a man and two testicles.	There is also one kind among women, in which there is, above the female pudenda, on the pubes, what resembles the male organs. These are small indeed, but protuberant, one being like the penis and the two others like testicles.	0.773049
And the treatment is of three types: two for men and one type for women. And it is that you need to cut those attached flesh until the appearance of it is removed, then treat them with wound care.	This is the treatment of all three kinds, that is, two male and one female: the superfluous growths must be cut away so that every trace is destroyed; then the usual treatment for wounds should be applied until they are healed.	0.77248245
And in the second type in men from which urine flows that is in the covering of the testicles, there is no treatment or operation for it.	As to the second kind, in man, where the opening is in the scrotum and the urine runs out of it, there is no operation for this, and no cure.	0.83575964
