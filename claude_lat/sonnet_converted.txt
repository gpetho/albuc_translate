Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I completed this book for you, O Sons, which is the last [book] of medical science with its completion, and I achieved its end through its expositions and explanations, it seemed right to me to complete it for you with this Treatise which is the part about operation, that is, surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since operation by hand has been laid low in our region, and in our time is entirely absent: until perhaps its science has perished, and its trace has been cut off: and nothing remained of it, except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered: and error and uncertainty befell them, until its purposes were closed off, and its power was diminished: It seemed right to me to revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise according to the way of exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation: and to present the forms of cautery instruments, and other instruments of the work: as it comes from the addition of explanation, and from the hastening of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good practitioner of it with his hand is not found in this time of ours, is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author needs to be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the uses of the limbs, and their forms, and their connections, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their exits, and of the pulsing and quiet veins, and their places of exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that Hippocrates said, that the name with the name is much, but with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We indeed have already spoken about that in the introduction of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since whoever is not knowing what we said about anatomy, cannot avoid falling into error, by which men are killed: as I saw many of those, who are formed of this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	Which is, because I saw a foolish physician who cut a scrofulous abscess in a woman's neck, and cut certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed, until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a man, who had advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore reached it, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I indeed had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician, who accepted payment from one of the Dukes of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, that there was a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions, and splints with strong binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he released him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he left him for several days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained thus until his leg became swollen, and his foot, and came to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	Therefore I was called to him: and I hurried to loosen the bandage: and tranquility followed, and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb, until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who pierced a cancerous abscess: and it became ulcerated after days, until its malignancy increased with its owner.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	Which is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then one should not approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate having all of it cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of that, O Sons, it is necessary for you to know that operation by hand is divided into two divisions: namely, operation associated with health: and operation with which there is danger in most conditions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already warned in every place of this book where an operation occurs in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and leave it alone: so that fools may not find a way to speak and dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore take measure with care and protection, and your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy success: and leave terrible diseases of difficult healing: and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, lest hesitation enter upon you in your faith and your benefit.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your measures.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad disease: lest you be named bad physicians.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have already divided this Treatise according to three Chapters. ¶
Capitulum primum.	Chapter First.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On Cautery with fire, and Cautery with sharp medicine, chaptered, and ordered from head to feet, and forms of instruments, and iron tools of Cautery: and everything that is necessary in operation. ¶
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Second.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On cutting and perforation, bloodletting and cupping, and wounds: and extraction of arrows, and similar to that: and all chaptered, ordered with forms of instruments. ¶
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of torsion, and similar to that: chaptered, ordered from head to feet, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God Alone.

¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	¶ On the Benefit and Harm of Cautery: and which complexions it suits, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But Before Indeed I recall operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its Benefits, and of its Harms: and in which complexion it should be administered.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that discourse on the quality of the benefit of Cautery, and its harm, is a lengthy discourse, and subtle, a science, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Indeed many wise men have spoken about it, and disagreed about it: and for me a little of their discourse suffices, fearing prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that Cautery is universally beneficial for every complexion that is with matter and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, regarding the hot and dry complexion with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that Cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of this, namely that Cautery is not suitable in illness which is from heat and dryness: since the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness be cured with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of this said: that through Cautery benefit occurs in every hot and dry illness which happens in human bodies: since when you compare the human body, and its humors, to the complexion of fire, you find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say through his discourse: because experiment has already revealed this to me several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, none should attempt this unless they have already been tested and trained in the chapter of Cautery with ultimate training, and has known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their symptoms, and their duration.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Concerning the remaining complexions there is no fear upon you: and especially in cold and wet illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have agreed about these: and they have not disagreed about the benefit with Cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of treatment by Cautery with fire, and its goodness over Cautery with burning medicine is: since fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member that is cauterized: and does not harm another member connected with it, except with small harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the members: and perhaps causes in the member an illness difficult to heal, and perhaps kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	This has indeed become known to us through experiment, because of long service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I am excused from length of discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not that it is not permitted in this book of mine, I would bring you a hidden secret about fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses with philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they disagree about the time in which it is suitable to perform cautery, and they place the best time as spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is suitable at any time: because the harm that occurs due to timing is outweighed by the benefit that is drawn from cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if cauterization is for pains among necessary, severe, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay: because it is feared from them that harm may occur which is greater than the small harm entering because of timing.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it fall into your minds, O sons, that which only the common people and foolish physicians believe, namely that the illness which is cured by cauterization never returns: and they make this a rule, but things are not as they think: because cauterization is nothing but a substitute for medicine, which alters the constitution and dries up the humors which are the causes why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization surpasses medicine through the speed of its effectiveness, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the constitution of the sick person, and the location of their illness, and its strength: and what is prepared in their body from the accumulation of superfluities in it: and what reaches it in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from causes, unless it is an illness in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and humors, like cauterization of a tooth for pain, and similar to it, it is indeed possible that that pain may not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But again the saying of the common people, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is a correct saying: not in the way that they intend it: since they believe that there is no cure that helps with medicine, nor with anything else after the setting of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The matter is actually contrary to that, and the intention that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is nothing but that when we administer modes of treatment in any of the illnesses, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cauterization at the end of the matter, and it helps: then from this it follows that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients moreover said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say that except because of the evenness of gold, and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that the site of cauterization does not produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But this is not absolutely true: since I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in certain bodies as opposed to others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However when you heat the cautery in fire made from gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated according to the amount that you want, because of the redness of gold: and when cold hurries to it, and if you increase the heating upon it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the practitioner falls from it into occupation: and because of that cauterization with iron among us is quicker and closer, from correctness to operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I indeed have already arranged this Chapter on Cauterization, according to chapters: and I arranged them from head to feet: so that they might ease for the seeker that which he wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the Head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here cauterization helps against the dominion of humidity and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of headache, and abundance of fluid flow from the head to the parts of eyes and ears, and abundance of sleep, and tooth pain, and throat pain: and universally every illness which occurs from coldness, like paralysis, and headaches, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar things from illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the sick person: that they should be evacuated first with purgative medicine cleansing the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the sick person requires, and their age, and their custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to have his head shaved with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have him sit squarely before you, such that he has placed his hands upon his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the base of your palm above the bridge of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with ink.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then heat the Olive-shaped Cautery: of which this is the form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the spot marked with ink, descending with your hand gradually restrained, and rotate it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and examine the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that a portion of bone the size of an alkiel or a zeuherb has been exposed, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat with the same iron, or with another if it has cooled: until you see the bones I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place cotton soaked in butter on it, and leave it on the spot until the fire scab is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the longer the wound remains open, the more pus it releases: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said to cauterize the skin down to the bone: and hold the Cautery until some thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape away what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that one should proceed with the cautery to the ultimate point, until it makes a strong impression in the bone, so that the bone falls away, which becomes like the form of a carat: or the instrument that women use with a small alphabet infusion: and they believe that vapors of the head are expelled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated until it consolidates.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	However, these two types of Cautery do not seem to me at all except in certain people by way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And leaving it alone, in my opinion, is better for their safety.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity: as we have witnessed in other limbs: and especially when the patient's head is naturally weak: and indeed the first species of Cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore operate with it safely.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the head for pain in the whole head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs in the whole head: and it persists in the patient, and he uses hieras, and cochias, and head purgatives, and oils, and poultices.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we described, and none of those things helps him: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the patient's head is of strong natural creation, and is not weak, and he experiences severe cold: then cauterize with another cautery slightly below that one.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize him over every corner of his head with the cautery, until it passes through the skin, and exposes bone to the quantity we described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with one cautery at the back of his head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is the place where the cupping glass is placed: and lift your hand in this, and do not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the patient experiences because of that severe pain, different from the pain of all other cauteries of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will discuss this Cautery in its place: and it is necessary that the cautery, with which the corners of the head and its back are cauterized, be more subtle than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cauterizing in migraine, both with burning medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain occurs in part of the head and migraine, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is evacuated with medicines that cleanse the head, and the remaining treatment that I mentioned in the division of diseases is administered, and all that does not help: then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with sharp burning medicine or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cautery with sharp burning medicine is when you take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the site of pain at the temple with a broad lancet, until there is a space under the skin in which the clove can be held.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore insert it under the skin until it is hidden: then bind it with a compress with appropriate pressure, and leave it for about fifteen hours then loosen it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterward place cotton soaked in butter on it, until the site produces pus: then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish, do this with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, concerning burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But its cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Heat the Cautery, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called Clavilis: because the form of its head is like the form of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in its middle there is a small protrusion.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the site, and hold your hand steady: and rotate the iron gradually with speed: and let the amount that is burned of the thickness of the skin be about half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that the artery which is below is not burned, and bleeding occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak cotton in salt water, and place it on the site, and leave it for three days: then place cotton with butter: afterward treat with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the second knife-like end of the Cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting the artery in this migraine, especially if not chronic.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in chronic migraine.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat migraine with what we mentioned from the preceding treatment, and what we mentioned in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the disease that what we mentioned from the first cautery with medicine or with cautery with fire is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the knife-like Cautery until it becomes white after you mark the site of pain with a line whose length is half a finger or thereabouts: and lower your hand once, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuity of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, lest the side or the nerve that moves it be burned, whereupon spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard and cautious about the bleeding of the artery which has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in cutting it there is danger, especially for one who is ignorant of what he is doing, and is not studious nor experienced: and abandons the operation with it at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with the remembrance of the management of bleeding occurring from the artery according to its method, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	But if you see from the disease that this Cautery is not sufficient for it, and you see the body of the patient tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we narrated, treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the Cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on extraction of the artery with the Cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For it is better cauterization than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterization for ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and is treated with solvents, and the remaining treatment which we described in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and this is what is called the Point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then puncture with it after heating it around the entire ear, as it revolves: or around both, if the pain is in both simultaneously.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And distance yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with ink: and let the amount of cauterization be ten points in each ear, or thereabouts.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the areas until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cauterization for Facial Paralysis.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Facial paralysis which is treated with cauterization is only from the types that occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the division of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of the type that occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of facial paralysis with hierae [medicines], and head purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment doesn't help, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little below from its temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For the softening occurs only in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize with the cautery in line with the upper extremity of the ear slightly below the horn of the head: and another at the temple: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And lower your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife-like instrument, whose form was mentioned before: however it is not much more subtle than it, as you see: and the knife in it should be slightly more thick than usual.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the areas with what was previously mentioned: until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterization in chronic Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we mentioned, and your medication doesn't help, and the patient doesn't have fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries above every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and a cautery in the back of the head, according to what preceded: and let the method of cautery be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also cauterize with a cautery above the mouth of the stomach: and this is most ultimate.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then let it be treated with what preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	On the method of cauterization for Memory Loss.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	First, the patient should be given great hierae to drink, and pills that purify the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the patient's entire head, and place on his occiput the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is a method of cautery: and do it according to the same order that I described there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make three cauteries in the posterior part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cautery with what preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you want an addition, and the patient can tolerate it: then make him a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	And if you want an addition: then cauterize him above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him until he heals: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form which was mentioned before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	On the method of cauterization in Paralysis and softening.

Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	You should proceed in purifying the head with hierae, and with what we mentioned.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the patient's head: afterward cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of the head, and a cautery above every horn of the head, and a cautery above its posterior part, and three above the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you need more than those in the disease of softening of the body, and the patient can tolerate it, and the disease is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and finish with the cautery, until most of the skin is burned, and lift your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then treat him until he heals: and thus the olive-shaped cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	On the method of cauterizing in Epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic person should not be cauterized, except one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore it is necessary that you first cleanse their brain with hierae [herbal medicines], and with the remaining treatment which we mentioned in the division: when the patient is grown, or is tolerant in accepting medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If however it is a child, who does not tolerate medicines, then administer gargling, and chewing substances that cleanse the brain, before that for many days with improvement of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave their head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what was previously described in the method: and with another cautery at the back of the head, and over every corner of their head with a cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	But if the patient is strong, and is tolerant, then cauterize them with the cauteries which I described for one having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded.

Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholia are corrupt humidities and thick phlegm, then cauterize them with the cauteries which we described for one having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclining to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give them to drink what will cleanse their brain, according to what preceded in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a properly made circular pad from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head: and let the patient sitting square be held from all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is most worthy from old sheep's butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over fire with moderate heating to a measure which a finger tolerates when it is inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then empty it in the middle of their head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do that to the patient once every week, with the rest of their good regimen, until they are healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize them making many small points, beyond which you do not hold the hand with the cautery: rather let it be by sensing.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this type of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then place cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat over it.

When the beginning of water in the eye becomes clear to you through the signs which I mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink what will cleanse their head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard them from all moistures, and make them sit in the bath, fasting for some days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command them to shave their head, and cauterize them in the middle of their head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize them over the two temples with two cauteries, if it is the beginning of water descending in both eyes together: or from one side, if it is the beginning of water in one eye: and cut with the cautery all veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauteries in it be long in the width of the temples: and beware of blood flow.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	But if you see any of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them, and caution against blood flow.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are ancient, constant: and are over veins and arteries which are manifest externally on the head, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I narrated in the beginning of descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need addition, then cauterize them on every side of the eye cavity, over the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on each side: and let them be distant from the two temples: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not extend your hand with the cautery, but rather according to the amount that burns a third of the eyelid.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing the Eyelid when hairs turn inward pricking the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	Cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cautery with fire: or cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cautery with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let his hairs grow, if he is among those who trim them, until they become long and even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If however they prick him at their growth: then bind his eyes with a band, so they don't move, until they grow.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they grow and become even, then place the patient's head in your lap: then mark on his eyelid with ink, a mark that should be in the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place cotton soaked in egg white: or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure which you marked gradually in many passes, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, all visible specifically.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye has contracted, and the hairs raised at the point where they prick the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore lift your hand then: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place Cotton with butter on it, until the scab falls off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if any of the hairs return after a while, and the eyelid becomes lax: then repeat the Cautery over that place, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If however the hairs are in the lower [eyelid]: then cauterize it, until it rises to its natural place: and becomes even so that the hairs don't prick the eye.

Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from paper or cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, of each one ounce or thereabouts: then grind them together with good grinding, and do this quickly, so that it does not cool.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread this over the paper which you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or both.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white: and let the patient's head be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger over the medicine, and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And move it whenever the patient feels the stinging of the medicine: for its stinging feels like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore the stinging that he feels persists, then leave the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the stinging subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And observe then, if you see the eyelid rising, as it rises during contraction with fire, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat with the medicine over the same place, where the medicine did not make an impression, and did not blacken, until your operation is even, and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place upon it cotton with butter, until the burnt skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation to guard with utmost care, lest anything from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if the eyelid softens after days, and some of the hairs fight in the eye, then repeat the medicine over that place which is softened from the eyelid specifically, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that people's eyes differ in size, both large and small.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore according to that should be your consideration: and the path of correctness is not hidden from one who has studied this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the method of cauterizing in lachrymal fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula with what we have described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not help: then, it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Command the patient to place his head in your lap, and let an assistant hold his head between his hands in such a way that he does not move, nor shake with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place cotton soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage over his eye: then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be hollow, like the shape of a vulture's feather quill at one end, with which the cauterization is done: and if you wish it may penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it may be held up thus.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this hollow one is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then squeeze the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place upon it the cautery, which should be very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with it a little while during cauterization away from the eye, toward the nose, so that your hand does not err, or the patient become disturbed: and you place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you reach in the beginning of your cauterization all the way to the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization once, or twice, if you need that: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place cotton with butter, and treat it with drying ointment, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	But if forty days pass, and it does not heal: then place upon it sharp corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the ancients have described.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Look to the location of the fistula, and split it open: then place in this split a thin camahan, that is, a thin tube, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with the tube with a good grip, and the patient should not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach their eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the lead burns the site of the fistula, and heals it with wonderful healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed with what we have described of cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to work on the opening of the nose, and redirect the fistula to the passage of the nose, according to what will come in its own proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in fissures of the Lips.

Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called Pili, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you treat these fissures with what we have described in the division of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife-like cautery, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its concavity be according to the thinness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place it heated quickly in these fissures, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with wax salve until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in fistula of the Mouth.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs in the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of teeth: then it makes pus, and bursts: afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and becomes a fistula: then you treat it, and if treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you heat a cautery according to the size that will fit in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then introduce it heated into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the heated iron reaches its depth and its end: do this once, or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it after that with what we have described of treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the discharge is cut off, and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to expose the area, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come in its chapter.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in Gums and loosened Teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum is softened because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it is not effective: then place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then heat a cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place the tube over the tooth: and introduce into it the heated cautery quickly: and hold your hand a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift your hand: then repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the loose tooth becomes firm, and the softened gum tightens, and the corrupt moisture dries up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	On the method of cauterizing for tooth pain.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When tooth pain is due to cold, or there is cold in it, or a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help: then Cautery for it is according to two methods: either Cautery with butter or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cautery with butter is when you take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge it in the boiled butter and place it quickly on the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools: then repeat this several times, until the power of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth: and place a heated iron over it, until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cauterization with fire is when you use a bronze tube or an iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And there should be some thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then heat the Cautery, whose form will come: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the Cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And in the application of that Cautery, the patient should fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour: then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the Cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever end you wish according to what is possible: and this is the form of the Tube.

Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When Scrofula is from phlegm and from cold humors, and they are not responsive to digestion through medicines, and you want their digestion quickly: then heat a hollow Cautery, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that smoke may exit during Cautery from the other end: and place it heated on the abscess once, and a second time if you need it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small: then apply the Cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place cotton soaked in butter on it, until what the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with tooth ointment until the form of the tube heals.

When humors overcome the pulmonary canal, and especially when this is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient first be evacuated with purgative medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize them in the depression at the root of the throat: and be careful not to reach the throat with the Cautery, nor in the skin, except a little of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize them with another cautery at the joint of the neck at its last vertebra finally: and let the Cautery be nail-shaped according to the method that preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat them with what preceded until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the method of cauterizing in diseases of the Lungs and Cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When Cough and disease of the Lungs are from cold humors, and the patient does not have fever, nor consumption, and the disease is chronic: then cauterize them with two cauteries above the collarbone in depressed, smooth, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be tube-shaped according to the form that preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncturing with the cautery which is called Point, whose form preceded in the puncturing for ear pain: and let the points be from thirty points up to about others.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat them with what preceded until they heal.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let there be a cautery having three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Whereby cauterization is made easier, when you make with it three Cauteries at once.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cauterizing in the Armpit, in dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to humidity, and is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation, until this becomes a habit of returning, then it dislocates from a small motion that occurs as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then let the patient lie on his back, or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin, which is in the inner Armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint dislocates inward.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then heat a Cautery having two prongs.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin, until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of cauterization will come with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, whereby the figure of cauterization then becomes six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the probe.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added above this method, whereby there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed leeks with salt over the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then have the patient remain still, so that the limb does not move for some time, until it strengthens.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upward, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a nail-shaped cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	On the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and many humidities occur in the Stomach, until they draw it from its complexion, and catarrhs multiply to it, and you have tried continuous modes of treatment, and it does not help: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery below the breast bone the measure of one finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below from the two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And separate between both so they do not join when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the measure of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery by which this is done be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing for one who is terrified of this cautery: and it is, that you mark upon the stomach points according to the quantity that you wish with ink: then cauterize it with a point cautery: then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On the method of cauterizing a cold Liver.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the Liver from coldness and humidity, or from thick windiness, until it departs from its natural complexion in excessive departure, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit in that: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his neck, and you mark with ink three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity over the Liver below the hypochondria, where the elbow of the person reaches: and let the space that is between every cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cautery much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of what is burned from the thickness of the skin be the quantity of half of it not added: and let the patient be standing on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If however he is not standing, then let him be lying, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-shaped cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself, that you do not proceed ultimately in cauterization, and the thickness of the whole skin is burned, whereby the whole body is burned, and it reaches to the intestines: since the skin there is thin, know therefore that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	¶ On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an abscess occurs, and you want to know if that swelling is in the liver tissue or in its membrane: then if it is in the liver tissue, the patient is seized by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the liver membrane, there is severe sharpness with the pain; and you see that its treatment has already exhausted the physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, the patient should lie back on their neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then heat the cautery that resembles a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one cautery until the whole skin is burned and reaches the peritoneum, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for abscesses until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And one should not use this type of cautery unless one's study in the medical art has been prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have occurred with some experimentation; only then should one dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But to leave it alone is, in my opinion, better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients spoke of cautery with birthwort roots for cold pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	That is, take from the dried long birthwort roots one of the longer roots that can be found, and let it be about the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in oil and light it in the fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in the area between the joint of the collarbone with the neck, and with two small cauteries below the guidezi slightly inclined to the part below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And also with two cauteries in the area between the fifth and sixth rib inclined slightly backward; and another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from behind: one between the shoulder blades, and two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be evident on the skin by smell.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancients have said that there are among men those who use an iron cautery similar to a rod: and they heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess itself and the pus comes out, as we said regarding the liver abscess.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with cautery there is the fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the Spleen Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat a disease of the spleen with what we mentioned about treatment in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then cautery for it is according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is that you make three or four cauteries in a line according to the length of the spleen following the pattern of liver cauteries, whose form preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cautery the width of a finger, or a little more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cautery be what we mentioned in the liver cautery equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie on their back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: that you heat a cautery having two prongs, which we mentioned in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and lift the skin that is in line with the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches: and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert the two prongs very hot, until you penetrate the skin with them from the other side: then remove the cautery: thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish, cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then treat the cautery after you let it discharge pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than the other treatments that preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the Method of Cauterizing in Dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	Cauterization is not applicable in dropsy, except specifically in ascites.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we mentioned in the classification, and the treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize them with four cauterizations around the navel, and one cauterization over the stomach, and another cauterization over the liver, and a cauterization over the spleen, and two cauterizations behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open, so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not cease treating the patient after cauterization with this: for it is necessary that two intentions be combined for him: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be nail-shaped: according to its previous form: and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the Method of Cauterizing Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they swell in a dropsical patient, and are filled with yellow water: you should cauterize over the top of the Foot in the nocrati, which is between the little finger and the ring finger: and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then lift your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water will seep out, and let the cautery be according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauterizations on the two legs on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-edge of the cautery: and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower than it, around the middle of the leg: and two cauteries on each hip: and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time: so that some of the water may seep out: then treat it with the remaining things we mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the Method of Cauterizing in Looseness of the Bowels.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and moistures, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers, which are in the stomach and intestines: and this is treated with methods of treatment, and is not cured: and you see the patient able to tolerate cauterization of abundant strength, then cauterize them with a large cautery over their stomach, according to what preceded in cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauterizations around the navel, with a small nail-shaped cautery: and a cautery over the lower back above the sacrum large, or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see abundant moistures, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize them with a cautery over the pubic region, and a cautery over each flank: and perhaps you may add two small cauteries over the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupt moistures, and they are treated with what we mentioned in the classification, and the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauteries over the lower vertebra of the back below the coccyx a little in a triangular pattern, and with a cautery below the navel about two fingers' width.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that their stomach has become cold, and their food is not being digested, and you see their face swelling, then cauterize them over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and with a cautery over their Liver, and another over their Spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat them until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing althelul (hemorrhoids) after cutting them off.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut off the althelul, then heat a cautery that resembles a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert this heated instrument into the cut althelul: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with whatever ointments benefit them until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the hip, it is most effective in helping.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not submit to the incision and procedure which we described in its place, and is frightened of it, perhaps he can be healed with cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore someone develops a fistula, and it becomes chronic, pus flows from it, and corrupted fluids.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore what is most proper is to probe it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then determine the depth of it with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then heat a cautery which is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the heated instrument into the fistula to the same depth that the probe entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupted tissues are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning a nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the area until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the area seals up, and the discharges cease from it, and it remains so for a long time: then know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the discharges do not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is corrupted bone, or something like that among those things: mention of which will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the Kidneys from cold, or from thick wind, and because of this the patient's strength diminishes, then you should cauterize him over the back over the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over each kidney with a nail-shaped cautery, mention of which came before.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize him a second time in the same place.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Wherefore three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be most effective in helping.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the Bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness occurs in the Bladder, and softening from cold and moistures, until the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize him in the lower part of the abdomen over the Bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and with a cautery on the right side of the abdomen, and another on the left of it: and let the length of that lateral cauterization be according to the size of the thumb joint: and cauterize him with a cautery on the lower back, or with two cauteries, if you need that: and let it be according to what preceded with the nail-shaped cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the Womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moistures occur in the Womb, and because of this she is prevented from becoming pregnant, and her menses are corrupted, and their onset is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is proper that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery over the hip lower on the back, or with two cauteries: and let it be a nail-shaped cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the Hip in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous humors flow into the hip socket, and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg becomes longer than the other when they are compared: and the site of dislocation is found empty in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore you should cauterize the patient on the hip socket itself with a circular cautery: after you mark with ink around the socket, as it revolves: and so that the socket itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the form that was previously described in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterizing in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip socket, and cold and humors are the cause of it: and the patient is treated with what we described in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then you should free the patient from thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cautery in it is according to two modes: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you cauterize above their hip socket with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them of good depth, or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space between each cautery be the width of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes the cautery is made in the middle over the head of the hip itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish, cauterize with a circle, whose form was previously described in the cauterization of hip dislocation, one: so that the circle contains the entire hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn through the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery in Sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place where the patient indicates there, where the pain is, and with your cautery above the ankle four fingers toward the outer part slightly: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the skin's thickness.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if the patient indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes of the foot, then cauterize there where he indicates with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if that is needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates the pain is below the knee toward the leg, then cauterize there with one knife-shaped cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And in all your cauterization, beware that you do not go so far with the cautery as to burn a nerve, or a major artery, and thereby bring upon the patient severe harm, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I indeed have seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in cauterization, and the leg swelled up, until the swelling reached the foot, and it was all perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then diarrhea occurred, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in both parts simultaneously, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men spoke about cauterization of the hip, whose cautery is of this mode.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make an iron similar to a forceps, whose diameter should be half a palm: and at its opening it should be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less: and within that forceps should be a third forceps.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space between each forceps be the size of a thumb joint: and let the forceps be open on both sides: and let their height be about one joint, or two joints: and make them an iron handle properly fitted to the forceps.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in fire until it becomes red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed over the hip socket with the patient lying on their healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	So cauterize it with three round cauteries at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards dress it with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis said, "O my sons, we have used this type of cautery little, because of its terrifying appearance: and because we find few who can endure it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is among the good cauteries for one who can bear it, and finds relief with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cautery with burning medicines is done thus: you make two curved pieces having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge of its gate made of bronze or iron, the length of the wall: in their height there should be two knots, or something like them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space between both be the width of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let them hold together, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it over the hip socket, with the patient lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly over the hip socket.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated somewhat with fire, and hold it for about an hour: and let the patient endure its biting and burning, for he will feel a biting like fire, until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument, and clean off the hot water from the entire hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is ultimate in benefit.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the thigh or leg: make for it a vessel containing water, just as you did for the hip in the same way.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the preparation of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unslaked lime, one part each: grind both and put them in a new pot whose bottom part is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that a rod might enter it: and place under the bottom of the pot another glazed pot: and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water that covers both by a finger's width: after you compress them well with your hand: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glazed pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water and pour it over other lime: and strain until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be of very strong sharpness, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterization of other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among the medicines with which the hip is cauterized are also like euphorbias, and cashew honey, and lime with soap, such that both are mixed. ¶
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed reported in narration a certain ancient man's cure, by which hip pain and sciatic vein were treated: and he greatly praised its effectiveness.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he needed no other treatment, and that he was cured in one session, until he reported that he perhaps entered the bath carried and left it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is thus: take green seitaragi: and if green is not found, take dry, fresh: and grind it well with some fat, and place it on the hip where there is pain, or leg, or in the thigh: and bind it, and leave it for about three hours, or for the time until the patient feels relief from the burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then bring him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes dewy, put him in the tub.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines except after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides indeed said that when goat dung is used to cauterize the sciatic vein, it helps it: and the cauterization is done in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep spot which is between the toe of the foot and the shin bone, and is closer to the shin bone.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dried goat dung, and inflame it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease doing this until the sensation reaches through the middle up to the hip, and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the Bovine cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	¶ On the cauterization of Back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the Back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and wet material: and cautery indeed is only applicable in this single type, which occurs from the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore after evacuating the patient with foul pills and similar things, it is necessary that three lines be made over the Back where the pain is, according to the width of its medial part, after you mark with ink in every line five cauteries, or more according to the amount that comes from the patient's tolerance of his strength: and let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a medium nail-shaped cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	¶ On the method of cauterizing at the beginning of Hunchback.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is: that constriction occurs in their breathing during elevation and movement: and you find in the last vertebrae of the Back and its nodes, that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	Therefore when you see that, and you wish to do it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery take hold equally over every part of the vertebra: and if you wish cauterize around the vertebra with a point cautery in two or three lines: and let the points be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the area until it heals with what we have mentioned.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, do not apply cautery in hunchback which occurs in nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in Gout and pains of the joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are from cold humidities, which are poured out to any members of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name that specifically Gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Therefore when Gout of cold cause is treated with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be Olive-shaped.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the surface of the foot, then do it with a point cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pains ascend up to the knees, or other joints, and this often occurs, then cauterize above every knee with three or four cauteries on every side, with this same nail-shaped cautery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however more than this cautery are necessary for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we said about cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	But if the pains are in the hands only, then make points around the arm bones, as two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however pain remains in the fingers, then make points over every joint a point, and over the back of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both on every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not empty the patient from good regimen, from the receiving of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good regimen is maintained, and phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with God's help with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a Rupture occurs in the groin, and intestine or omentum descends to the testicle, and it is in its beginning stages and nearby: then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to stop eating on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And he should use laxatives, by which stool may descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then he should sit before you on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath, until the omentum or intestine comes out or appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then return it with your fingers, and mark with ink below the Rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose end is similar to half a circle toward the upper body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then heat the cautery, which is of this form, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then return the intestine or omentum to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant place his hand over the spot, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the patient's legs, and placed a pillow under him, and another servant is on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on this mark, your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you reach bone with it: or repeat with it a second time, if you did not reach the bone with it on the first try.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully watch for the exit of intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and through that either death or great harm comes upon the patient.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery for children be thin, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with the remaining ointments until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound seals.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you arrange his nourishment throughout the duration of his treatment to be that which loosens his belly: so that the intestine does not come out during straining and defecation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to rise after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him reduce labor, and fullness of food and drink, and violent voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he follows this regimen, he is thus healed with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will describe the treatment of Ruptures with incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When however Ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and they are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize its Rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be like a third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat it with what we have mentioned: and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some of the ancients have already said: that the Rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which goes across the upper side of the Rupture, and another line to the lower part.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to falls or blows.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow: and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is not effective: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a Point cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery of each limb be a cautery according to its size and its smallness, and its weakness and its strength, and the location of the twisting and pain in it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it heals from the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cautery on it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For it is the habit of these pains to move from one limb to that which is near it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary that you follow them with the cautery until the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the Method of Cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with the greatest benefit.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of Leprosy which occurs due to putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: when therefore you wish to cauterize it, consider the following.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the Leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it neither descends nor stays: and you fear for the patient that corruption might overtake his entire constitution: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the known head, and a second lower towards the forehead near the hairline, and two above the corners [of the forehead], and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And [apply] your hand with the cautery gradually, until it makes a small impression in the bone, and scales are displaced from it: so that the expiration of thick vapors from it is relieved, and also cauterize with cautery over the spleen, according to what was previously stated.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the Leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries which we mentioned in the head, and with cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two jaws, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the coccyx near the tail bone and one above it, in the same sacral region: and two on the hips: namely one on each hip, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the tender parts of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint of the joints of his hands and feet: and cauterize on every heel of his feet and the bones of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with cautery over the pubic bone, and another over the stomach bone, and another over the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more cautery you add, the greater the benefit and the more helpful it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery as healthy people feel it: because his body has already become numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And the cauteries should be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to what was previously stated about the types of iron instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the cautery with vetch flour with honey, and the remaining treatment, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the Method of Cauterizing in Numbness.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any limb becomes numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb itself with cauteries, according to what the size of the limb or its smallness deserves.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for certain numbness, which occurs in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves, which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let no one presume to do this unless they are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of the nerves moving the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the Method of Cauterizing in Vitiligo.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When vitiligo becomes chronic, and nothing from medical treatments helps in it: then cauterize over it with a somewhat deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with vetch flour and lentils with rose oil, and plantain leaves, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: of each take one part: mix all these, and spread them on a cloth, and apply to the place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the Method of Cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise ones however said to cauterize with a final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	This does not seem right to me: since I fear that it might ulcerate: and I have already seen this several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is more correct to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said: or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubelati, and it is slow to mature, either due to excess matter causing it, or due to the age of the patient, when he is decrepit with little blood, or due to timing, and you wish to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around its circumference with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which the patient follows, so that the flow of pus may be relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterizing in corrosive disease.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Corrosive disease is nothing but corruption moving in a limb, and it corrodes it: like fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see corrosive disease in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat many cauteries, small and large nail-like ones, according to what is suitable for that place where the corrosive disease is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until you eradicate all corruption, and nothing remains of it at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and place ground sulfur with oil over the cauterized areas, until all scabs and all corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days flesh grows with healthy growth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery over what remains of the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And corrosive disease is sometimes treated with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises in place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is of swifter benefit: and I indeed have already spoken about its cauterization with sharp medicine in the division: therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing in Nails and Warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Many times this illness occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, compacted thing, which harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And cautery indeed in these is according to two modes: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for with fire, it is that you heat a concave cautery similar to a vulture's feather: which should be made of iron, of such size that it contains the nail from all sides: and it should have thin edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it heated over the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then rotate your hand with the cautery around the circumference of the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster it with wild mallows, ground with salt: and leave the plaster on it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they are not converted, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer in them cautery with hot water: that is, take a small tube of brass, or iron, or from a vulture's feather: and place it over the nail, or althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand, and rotate it with compression of your hand a little, so that the edge of the tube is impressed in the root of the nail, and the hot water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait a little over the stinging of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it, for the nail will be eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do thus with them one after another, until you come upon all of them that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from the ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cauterizing for Tremors.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When someone experiences tremors from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize them with four or five cauterizations above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on their chest with a cautery, and above their stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	Indeed, tremor subsides with olive-shaped cautery, and healing of cold illness hastens.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing Albathir [pustules].
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul Albathir appear on the body, that is, pustules, which form from thick corrupted matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore it is necessary when they first appear, that they be cauterized above every pustule head with a fine cautery using myrtle wood, whose end is lit with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes ademenul are cauterized, at the beginning of their emergence according to this method: and they do not increase: and the excess causing them breaks open, and is healed from these.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation through bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterizing for blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often blood flow occurs from an artery which is cut near a wound that happens externally, or near the incision of an abscess, or cautery of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When therefore this happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger over it: and press it firmly, until the blood is contained under your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small and large olive-shaped cauteries, several in number, in the fire: and blow on them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and location where the artery is torn, and place the cautery on the vein itself, after you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood stops.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it spurts out when you lift your finger from the artery opening, and the cautery cools, then quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not cease doing this with one after another, until the blood stops.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And take care not to burn the nerve that is there, lest another misfortune befall the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it: especially when the artery is large, except by one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Either with cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends contract, and the blood stops.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it may be tied with thread in a strong binding.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicines may be placed over it whose property is to stop blood, and it may be compressed with a cushion with proper pressure.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But he who attempts to stop it with bandaging, and tightening with cloth, or placing burning things and similar items, it helps him not at all, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If however this happens to someone, and no physician or medicine is present: then let him begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and pressing it very firmly, until the blood is contained from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, [but] pour very cold water over it continuously, until the blood congeals, and thickens, and stops.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile consider what is needed from cautery or from medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	¶ On Incision, Perforation, and Bloodletting in wounds, and similar matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the First Chapter about every illness in which cauterization with fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed chapters there from head to foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I shall proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the search may be made easier for the seeker.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin it, you should learn, O sons, that in this chapter there is as much terror as there is in the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that it is necessary that caution in it be more vigilant, since in the operation which is in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands, during the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a swelling, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision for a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and in many of them death occurs.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation should fall upon you, for sometimes in this art types of men come to you with types of infirmities.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	Among them is he who becomes angry with his illness, and death is light to him: because of the severity of what he finds from his infirmity and the length of its malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with the illness there is fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is he who gives you his wealth, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, while his illness is fatal.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore you should not consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vigilant than your desire and your greed.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from that, except after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which praiseworthy success leads.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the treatment of all your patients, prognosis and indication of that to which health suitably follows.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that there is help for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire in you, O sons, His understanding, and not take away from you guidance and inspiration: since that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And indeed I have arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from neck to feet: so that the quest which you want from it, and which you need, may be made easier for you.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	¶ On the treatment of Water which collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this illness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife squeezes the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed I have not seen this illness in others than in children: and death hastened to all of them whom I saw: therefore because of that it seemed to me better to abandon operation in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I saw among them a child, whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit up by himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And indeed this moisture either collects between the skin and bone: or collects under the bone over the membrane.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that, if the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, then it is necessary that you make in the middle of the head one incision in width: and let the length of the incision be about two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture has increased more, and the swelling is larger, then make these two incisions, according to this form. 
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from all sides: and the water is depressed when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and this is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this way. 
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision extract all the moisture. 
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the incisions with cloths and small pads. 
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then foment it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day. 
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with probes and ointments. 
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not cease to bind the head evenly. 
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the patient every dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed. 
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is that you observe where the size of the swelling appears, and the collection of water. 
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Since sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the sinciput, or on the right, or on the left. 
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore ascend with the incision where the swelling and fullness of water appears to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you. 
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you cut an artery, and bleeding occurs, and the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture. 
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	¶ On the Incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter 2. 
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When catarrhs occur to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and this becomes chronic, and treatment with medicines does not help: then the most ultimate treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries. 
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore it is necessary when you wish to cut them, that the patient shave his head. 
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear. 
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the patient bind his neck with whatever cloth of his. 
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then observe where the vein pulses. 
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both are the depressed places which are behind the ears: and rarely is it hidden, except in certain men. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with ink over both: and cut both with a double-sharp spatula, with an incision reaching to the bone: and let that be done across the width of the head. 
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and cut it upwards with an incision. 
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers. 
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood exits in a pulsing manner, which leaps inward with frequent jumping. 
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to observation, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the space of three fingers. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with ink, and cut until reaching the bone. 
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which is necessary to emit of blood is 6 ounces and perhaps you emit more or less from it. 
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All that according to the amount which appears to you from the patient's strength and the fullness of his artery. 
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then attend to the wound. 
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains of the membrane at the bone, then cut it, so that a hot swelling does not occur: then bind the wound with linen cloth strips. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III. 
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a person suffers from chronic migraine, or acute catarrhs due to sharp humors, and heat in the muscles of the temples, or chronic severe headache, and similar conditions: and when treated with methods of medical treatment, and it does not help: then we have tested in these illnesses the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described. 
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them is that the patient should shave the hairs that are on the temples, and attend to the visible artery in the temple. 
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it shows itself to you by its pulse, and rarely is hidden except in few people, or in extreme cold. 
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	But if it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind his head with any of his cloth: then rub the area with a rough cloth. 
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or steam the area with hot water, until it appears to you with clear appearance. 
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I formed a little while ago. 
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then carefully strip the skin with it until you reach the artery. 
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upward until you extract it from the skin, and make it free from the membranes that are beneath it on all sides. 
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is thin: then wrap it with the end of the hook. 
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut a portion of it according to the length by which its ends separate and contract, and bleeding does not occur. 
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, blood does not rise at all. 
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then drain from the blood six ounces, up to three. 
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then you must tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk: or with strings of gut, so that decay does not hasten to it before the wound consolidates, and bleeding occurs. 
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the excess that is between the two ligatures. 
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that in that hour, or after another hour. 
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife-like cautery: until its ends are cut, and it will remain in place of the same operation. 
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is the better procedure, unless the patient has fever, or is of hot complexion. 
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Since cautery is among those things that help to end humidities. 
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is the better aid. 
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of arteries, it is necessary that the place be filled with old cotton: and properly made compresses be placed upon it. 
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after loosening treat with dry medicines, which make flesh grow, and with lint pledgets, until it heals. 
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if meanwhile while you are operating bleeding occurs from the artery, then hasten to stop it with cautery, or to fill the place with vitriol: and press your hand, until the blood stops. 
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	But if none of those things is present with you, then place your finger over the place, until the blood congeals. 
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And bathe the place with very cold water, until the sharpness quiets, and it is bound as necessary. 
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And among what is lighter and easier than extraction of the artery, is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to almagdatem. 
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However they are of much less sharpness than two knives. 
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp, like two knives, cold hastens to both: and they do not cut flesh quickly. 
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When therefore there is some thickness in them, the heat of fire is retained in them, and flesh is cut quickly: with this therefore the procedure is better than every procedure, and lighter, and easier. 
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space that is between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink: and set both down very hot, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its ends separates. 
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not consolidate at all with this cautery. 
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	¶ On the treatment of constant acute tear flow from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are constant, and their flow is from the veins that are on the outside of the skull of the head: and no medical treatment with medicines helps them, and you see the patient's face becoming red, and he feels in his forehead a movement, like the movement of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their eyelashes have been eroded with corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of tears: then the ancients needed this operation in treating them, and they called it treatment with the Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is that you should order the patient to shave the hair that is on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equidistant incisions in the forehead according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be about two fingers, and let one incision be parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length slightly away from the movement of the muscles, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on the two sides: and keep your hand away from the connection of the two jaws, and let the space of each incision be the width of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dried cloths, with which to dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose form follows next.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is on the side of the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with the membrane that is over the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp knife, sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side toward the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side toward the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision should not continue up to what appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal amount of blood has flowed, squeeze the areas to remove pieces of clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure a wick of old cotton, and place over them compresses soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that no hot inflammation occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the bandage, and apply plenty of infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with basilicon ointment and the other things with which wounds are treated: until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ On the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the interior of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When someone experiences acute, sharp, constant catarrhs: and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their sight has already been weakened: and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and in the depth of the head there is sharp, harmful pain, and consequent sneezing: then take from these symptoms, that those materials and catarrhs come only from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you should order the patient to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one incision in it in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to the other side across the width, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be down to the bone: and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples, which move during chewing: until when the bone is exposed: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton, or with linen wicks.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind over it with compresses: and soak the compresses with wine and oil, so that no hot inflammation occurs.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it, and you see that the hot inflammation has already diminished: then it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that makes flesh grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony: and prepare from them a plaster, and let it be administered for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the treatment of what falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the Ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone, or something similar to stone, like iron and glass; or it is from a plant, like chickpeas and beans; or it is a flowing substance, like water and vinegar and similar things; or some animal. 
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or a type of stone from those which neither expand nor grow in the ear, expose the Ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then drip into the Ear something from violet oil, or sesame oil. 
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer its extraction, and cause sneezing with condisi, and block the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear upward. 
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Many times indeed it comes out with this treatment. 
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If however it does not come out, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, fine tweezers: whose form is this. 
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out with tweezers, it is good. 
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine blunt hook of little doubling. 
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out by that means, then make a tube from bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal deeply, and block what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there is no path for air except through the tube: then extract with your breath by strong suction. 
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many times indeed it comes out with what we have described. 
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If however it does not come out this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it on the tip of a probe after you wrap it with cotton properly positioned: then insert it into the ear canal with care, after you dry the ear from moisture. 
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have described, then hurry to cut, before a hot abscess occurs, or spasm. 
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of cutting is that you first bleed the patient in the cephalic vein: and draw blood from him according to the measure of his strength. 
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then have the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fatty part in the depressed place there: and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you. 
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew the incision immediately with speed, and treat it until it heals. 
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	But if the thing falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell: then administer its extraction. 
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If however it does not yield to you for exit, then take a thin, fine spatula, according to this form. 
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting of that type of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do that when you think that grain has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you make it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with fine tweezers, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is made easier. 
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	For water however which enters the ear, it is necessary that the patient use sneezing with condisi first: and he has already filled his ear with some old cotton: and he is lying on that ear in which the water is. 
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out by that means, it is good. 
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire a little, and let the patient insert one of them into his ear canal: and let him hop on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear. 
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore he should not cease doing that with stone after stone, until all the water comes out. 
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And water indeed comes out so that you take from papyrus, or from reed one piece, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until most of it burns. 
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat with another reed, and do that many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a tube according to what was described previously for the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extracting small animals that enter it (the ear), if it is of small body, like a flea or similar, treat it as I described in the division. 
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large body, which is visible to the senses: then perform its extraction with forceps and hooks: and this matter is easier than all things that are held in the ear. 
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In extracting a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we described in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you should examine the ear in sunlight. 
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears there from the worms, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks. 
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however nothing appears there, then take a small tube, which has this form, narrow below, wide above: and insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate: then suck with it using strong suction. 
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times, until all worms come out. 
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If however they do not yield to you for exit, then seal the circumference of the tube with wax, as I said regarding the stone. 
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	But if they do not come out with what we described: then administer the distillations which the ancients have already tested in killing worms: and you will find that in the treatise on distillations. 
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring with which you pour oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. 
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see make it from silver, or bronze, narrow below, in which there should be a small opening, wide above. 
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore let the plunger which is in the cavity of the tube be made appropriately from bronze. 
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a probe, and wrap cotton at its end with a proper wrapping: then pour the oil, or juice, or whatever you want from these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then insert the probe with cotton from above, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is forced into the cavity of hearing, and the patient feels it inside: and let that which is poured into the ear be already slightly warmed with fire: and take care that the thing which is distilled into it is not very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of blockage occurring in the Ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7. 
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs with [ears] not perforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And blockage in the ear canal also happens to some people from a wound, or flesh growing in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear hole, which sight cannot reach: and sometimes it occurs near the exterior of the hole, and sight can reach it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore that which occurs deep in the ear, and which sight cannot comprehend, is in most cases difficult to cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And for that which sight can reach, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look into it: then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a thin spatula, whose form follows here, let its tip have some small width, of which some part should be sharp: and let the rest of the spatula have two smooth sides: so that it does not harm the ear. 
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal: then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it with careful force, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	But if the blockage is deep in the ear: then take a thin, smooth probe, and heat it slightly with fire: then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you sense the blockage with it, which the patient finds with difficulty of hearing, attempt to open it carefully: and beware, lest you wound the ear nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a lint according to the size of the hole's width, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days, until you are assured of the wound's healing.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take lint, and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle ground vitriol over it, and use it. 
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear becoming infected: then you should remove the lint, and replace it with another lint, which you will wrap in a wax preparation made with rose oil, until the hot inflammation subsides: then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if bleeding occurs: then submerge a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place them over that ear: and use the remaining treatment, which stops bleeding as described in the treatise on distillations. 
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the treatment of warts of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8. 
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These warts that occur on the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist, and are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore you should hold them with forceps: or with a hook, and cut them with a spatula from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place ground vitriol over the areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterizing them is better after incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and do not return. 
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of Hailstones of the eye's eyelids.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9. 
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often occurs in the eyelids something that resembles Hailstone in its hardness, and its firmness, and because of that it is called Hail: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid, and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore the operation on them is, that you should consider then, if it is Hail proceeding in what appears of the eyelid, and they move to every part, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore make an incision over it lengthwise.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then carefully excise it from all sides until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if its removal is not possible for you, except after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the patient somewhat.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the incision is large: then bring it together with sutures: and treat it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it, and makes it heal.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the hail is declining toward the interior of the ear toward the inner surface, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the hail with a hook: rather than needing incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	But if the eyelid is elongated by the incision, that does not harm in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the hail, with salt water: and treat the area with that which heals, until the patient recovers.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of Axirnath of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fatty substance that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid: and indeed it occurs mostly in children: and it weighs down their eyes, and they get catarrhs in the mornings, and they cannot look at sunlight, because tears come quickly to them, and because of this you see them always lying on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, which swelling has already covered: and indeed the prominence of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them. 
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is that the patient should place their head in your lap. 
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth, and prepare strips from it, and make from that strip a circle according to the size that contains the Axirnath from all sides. 
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over it, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle. 
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then make an incision in the middle of that moisture with a cutting spatula, making cuts across the width, and let the incision not be deeper than what is made in phlebotomy. 
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Either it is necessary that you cut the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath for in many cases the Axirnath comes out of the incision in the form of a piece of white fat. 
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it with a cloth, which you have worked between your fingers toward the outside: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it disperses: and take care not to deepen the incision, lest you reach the eye with the spatula and harm it. 
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should deepen the incision a little bit carefully, until the Axirnath comes out. 
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said. 
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with small cushions. 
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And among people there are those who grind salt and place it in the cavity of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may dissolve. 
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals. 
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a hot abscess occurs in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	¶ On the types of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft, whereupon it wrinkles in a way it shouldn't.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs grow in the eyelids beneath the natural hairs and become established: then they harm the eye and cause various types of ailments, such as constant tearing, softening of the eyelids, and white spots, until this becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed Ataxmir of the eye is treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Either by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what was described in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by tubes, according to what I will describe.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it turns, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle with thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate through with the thread from above, and let this be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it with a probe.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the additional hairs with a cutting spatula from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with ink a figure like a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the figure be according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: since this varies among people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	Among them indeed is one who needs to have cut from the eyelid a large amount, according to the amount that has become soft from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spatula cut along the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct up to the smaller tear duct, and let one cut be near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a probe.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then excise all of it.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then join the two edges with sutures, using a needle and fine wool thread: and wipe away the blood, and make what is excess of the threads adhere above the two eyebrows, with certain sticky substances, if you wish to do this: and if not, don't worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days: afterward treat it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with something that dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated during the sealing of the wound and its joining: but suturing is better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancients taught this method of treating Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, in it there is concern for the patient, and it is from good practice, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And there is another method also in Ataxmir: and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure that is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then elevate the eyelid with three hooks separated or joined, according to this form which follows, then cut what is excess with small scissors, according to this form, with evenness of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and that is not even: then take a needle with thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and gather the threads between your fingers evenly.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with an even elevation: and elevate the skin over which the cotton is marked, as we described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two edges of the wound with sutures: and treat it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If however swelling occurs at your incision or your cut: calm that swelling with wax ointment, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it also happens to the eyelid that its hairs turn inward.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore it is necessary that you use in it what we said in incision: but suturing in both cases is more skillful.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds. 
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is thus: you turn over the eyelid and make an incision in the inner fissure, according to what I have described. 
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood: their length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already made cuts in the extremities of both on both sides where you hold the threads. 
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then carefully bring both together over what protrudes from the eyelid, and bind the two reeds tightly on both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. 
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the constricted skin will die, turn black, and rot, until it falls off by itself. 
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. 
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals. 
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it heals, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick. 
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two reeds, which you will make according to this figure and measurement in length and width. 
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On raising pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII. 
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this case is that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread. 
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather its ends, and tie both with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm. 
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then arrange in the Alinxotati another fine thread below it briefly, and tie its ends if you wish. 
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation is clear: since it is a delicate or minute operation. 
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair. 
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up above the alinxotati: and insert into the alinxotati that hair: whether it is one, or two, or three, not more. 
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair. 
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull the alinxotati downward, with the thread that you arranged in it, until the alinxotati comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with your eye: then indeed pull the alinxotati and the thread: and extract both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it. 
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is raised with it: or leave it until it lengthens after a time, and then raise it. 
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII. 
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina (Hare-eye). 
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental. 
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	The accidental therefore occurs from the healing of a wound, or an incision, or a cautery, and similar things to these. 
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in it is that you split that healed area, and separate its edges, and place between them a lint of flax, and bind it until it heals. 
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not proper that you use in its treatment things which dry out and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather use in it things which soften, like fenugreek: and foment with water in which marsh-mallow and flaxseed have been cooked: and with diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some of the oils: and wrap the lint with it, and treat with it. 
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all ingenuity, that it does not heal according to the form which was there at first. 
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is nothing but a certain rectification of Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return entirely to what it was.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below is what is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental type occurs from a wound, or a fissure, or cauterization, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation for it is that you should take a needle with a double thread, and push it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upward with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a probe, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them: until when they are joined their shape becomes this figure, which is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower edge, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separated parts: sew it with wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we mentioned, with softening medicines, and lint, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cauterization: then you should make a flat fissure under the eyelid hairs, also according to what preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with lint, according to what we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the discussion about treating Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed in it according to how the form of Alxatrati presents itself.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it has many variations in form: and the skilled craftsman prepares his technique in whatever way is possible for him, until he makes the shape return to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him in terms of operation and instruments in most conditions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, such that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid, and raise it upward: or stretch it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not have a sharp cutting edge, rather it should be somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not harm the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you are skinning that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion heals.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with water: or drip into it from an eye-salve made from verdigris dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and eye with linen lint: and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white: and after the third day use eye-salve, and with healing agents, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	¶ On the incision of the pterygium and the prominent flesh of the tear ducts.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the pterygium occurs in two forms.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is fibrous: and it is similar to a hard, thin membrane.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is non-fibrous, similar to white congealed fluid: which when iron touches it, or when you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks apart, and the hook does not hold in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types begin only from the larger tear duct, until it gradually progresses until it covers the vision, and blocks light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating in its incision is: that the patient places their head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open their eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the pterygium with a hook of little doubling, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from a horse, and ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the pterygium: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the pterygium with the thread, and extend it upwards: and strip away with the hair the side of the pterygium that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair all the way to its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that constant tearing does not occur from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the pterygium is extended with just a hook: or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is stripped away with a smooth spatula, whose form is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful, lest the spatula touch the cornea, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw into the eye some ground salt, or from an eye-salve made from verdigris, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is appropriate, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	But if the pterygium is non-fibrous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor does a hook hold in it, then many times this type of pterygium is treated with medicines, and heals as I described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	But if you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take a fine spatula, smooth, of weak sharpness, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the pterygium from above with a scraping motion with delicacy.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	But if you see that it becomes thin and breaks apart, and the scraping makes an impression in it, then drip at that time into the eye from an eye-salve made from verdigris, or from red eye-salve, or ground salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation upon it, until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is opposing you in the eye a hot abscess: then indeed leave it, and treat the abscess, until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation upon it with scraping, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The prominence of the tear duct flesh, however, if it causes great harm in the eye, let it be suspended with a hook, and cut from it a part of it: and do not complete the incision, so that constant tearing does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then drip into the tear duct red eye-salve, or one made from verdigris, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh growth in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17. 
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in certain human eyes there grows red flesh, either composite or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or binds over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a pomegranate flower. 
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for this is also that the patient should place their head in your lap. 
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open their eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for that purpose: and hold it with one forceps, or surgical instrument. 
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then first cut the flesh, until all of it is removed with the cutting instrument. 
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful with the eye, so that you do not harm it during the operation: and let your incision with which you cut it be either with the small spatula, which we described in the section on pterygium incision: or with small scissors, with which asebel is collected, according to the form that will come after this chapter. 
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	Therefore when your incision is complete, and all of the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or drip in red powder, and similar corrosive medicines: and place externally on the eye a cotton pad with egg white: so that it may be protected from hot inflammation. 
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If any of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear hot inflammation: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms inflammation. 
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then return to it with the operation, until it is healed. 
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with additional flesh which occurs in the eye of this type. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you avoid treating any eye that is weak by nature or by accident by operating with iron: and do not introduce your hand in any of these operations until you see that that member can tolerate that operation. 
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18. 
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent vision its operation: and weaken the eye with the length of days. 
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is Sebel is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides Sebel: then collect its Sebel. 
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is that you should instruct the patient to place their head in your lap. 
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be of subtle doubling, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, according to this form. 
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with subtle scissors those veins with subtlety, and wipe away blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are dissolved: and be careful not to harm the eye with the ends of the spatulas. 
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at noon before the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you cut nothing except those veins. 
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then drip green or red sief into the eye: so that by its sharpness it may corrode what remained of the sebel. 
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which sedates the pain of the eye: and leave it for some days, until its pain is sedated: and it is secured from hot inflammation: then return to it in the same way, until it is healed. 
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the Reduction of Arissati to the Nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Doctors call Arissati a Fistula, which you treat with cautery, or with sharp burning medicine, according to what was previously described.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no technique for it except to cut open above the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption in it, or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called "of the rough head."
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made from Indian iron, and let its head be round like azir, which should be dotted with file-like dotting, or with aliskilfer dotting with fine points: and place it over the corrupted part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the area with drying astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the area heals, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus stops: and it remains for forty days, and does not renew, and does not form an abscess, and no complication occurs in it: then know that it has healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no technique for it except to redirect the fistula to the nose opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	That is, expose it from the second bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill of this form, let the iron tip be triangular: and its wood should be a pyramid tapered to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and keep your hand a little distance from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: by this that he finds wind coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the area with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh grows, and the area hardens: then the matter which was pouring to the outside returns to the nose: this is therefore easier for the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the Reduction of Eye Protrusion.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the Eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm occurs to vision, nor diminishment: then it is necessary that you loosen the patient: then perform phlebotomy on him: afterwards place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the Eye a liniment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the Eye from above over the plaster with many compresses.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of compresses is: that you take many soft cloths, and each cloth from them should be folded in four: make many of these: then place them one above another, according to the quantity that the Eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth with strong binding.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound for a day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the bandage becomes loose again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly: then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye has returned to the uveal tunic, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and compresses, and binding, and cupping glasses, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the Incision of the Uveal Membrane.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21. 
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the uveal membrane, and then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is disfigured because of it, and you wish to cut it: then the operation on it is as I describe: that is, you should insert a needle at the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part. 
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate: and leave the first needle in its position. 
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the needle: and tighten it firmly. 
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye: and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea. 
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound heals. 
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the uvea is constricted from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye produces a large protrusion. 
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it should be perforated with a fine spatula, which should reach to the depth of the eye, and the albuminous fluid should flow, and the eye should descend, and enter immediately: then compress it until it heals. 
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the Treatment of Alcomnati.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22. 
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This Disease which is called Alcomnati is nothing but pus, which collects in the eye, similar to descending water, but is not the same. 
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is that you should have the patient sit on a prepared or straight seat. 
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower part with your eyes. 
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it should be fixed, and not descend, and light should be released: and the patient should see things as he used to see: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water. 
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the descent of pus is not achieved with what we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands. 
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula, and make a small incision with it above the corneal membrane at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the corona, until the pus comes out. 
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore it comes out, then drip warm water mixed with honey into the eye: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then it should be treated with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water that descends in the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23. 
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing with explanatory and expository discourse, so take that same according to health. 
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Therefore you should have the patient sit square between your hands, facing the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and bind it tightly: then [hold] his eyelid with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one. 
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take the needle (almagda) in your right hand, if the eye is left: or in your left hand, if the eye is right. 
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the needle near the corona [iris] about the width of a radius in the white of the eye appearing at the smaller tear duct: then push the needle with force: and you rotate your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the needle has reached an empty space. 
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And the measure of the needle's path to the depth should be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: which is the corona of the eye. 
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see these things in the pupil itself by visual inspection, due to the clarity of the corneal membrane. 
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the needle up to the place where the water is. 
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downward one time after another. 
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the patient sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, with the needle still in his eye. 
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while. 
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then lower it a second time, before the needle comes out. 
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed and does not rise: then extract the needle with care: and you rotate your hand gradually. 
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some clear rock salt in water: and wash the inside of the eye with it. 
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place outside the whole eye either tow or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white: and bind the healthy eye with it. 
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We moreover, and those of our time, place ground cumin with egg white upon it. 
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	But if the needle does not yield to you for entry into the eye due to its hardness, since among men there are those whose eye is very hard: then you should take the small spatula which is called Alberid, of which this is the form. 
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore perforate the conjunctiva itself only with it, and do not complete your hand in the hole: and it is only so that you make a subtle path to the place for the needle. 
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the needle, according to what we have said. 
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your operation, let a properly made sleeping place be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and let him be prohibited from all movements and from coughing: and make his food that which softens his nature: and let him not move his head right or left at all. 
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day. 
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his vision: and make him look at things. 
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then replace the bandage until the seventh day. 
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And he should not do that at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather you should keep that away: because the water rises quickly through intense looking. 
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a hot swelling occurs: then you should loosen the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with that which calms the swelling, until it is calmed: then free his vision, and place over his face a veil by which his vision may be regulated under it for some days, while he remains in that dark room. 
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him leave the room gradually, and spend time in his houses. 
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in surgery the student cannot be excused from observing sometimes: for then he may dare to perform the operation. 
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed there has come to us someone from those who are from Alayrach, who said that in Alayrach a perforated needle (magdan) was made, by which water is sucked out. 
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But truly I have not seen anyone in our land who has done that: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that this is new. 
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the types of needle, so that one who is ignorant of them may understand them. 
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made specifically from brass: and let their ends be with this same subtlety triangulated, and the end sharp. 
Formae magda.	Forms of the needle.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	¶ On the Treatment of Flesh Growing in the Nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24. 
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Various types of additional flesh sometimes grow in the nose, among which is one that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and among them is cancerous flesh, stone-like, of dark color; and among them is flesh that is smooth, not of dark color. 
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore in the case of flesh among these that is smooth, not deceitful, nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit before you facing the sun, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into that flesh; then draw it outward, and cut what you have grasped of it with a thin sharp spatula from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed. 
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If any should remain whose removal is not possible: then scrape it with one of the fine instruments gently, until nothing of it remains. 
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If however blood overwhelms you, or a hot swelling occurs: then treat it as appropriate: or if it is among the malignant swellings, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is stopped, and all flesh is removed. 
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then after the incision, pour vinegar and water, or wine into the nose. 
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If however the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it down to the palate, then know that it is already healed. 
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If truly the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it there is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nostril, which the instrument cannot reach with cutting. 
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore then it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it: and place between each knot the distance of a finger, or less: and the patient should contrive to insert one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for them after making it similar to azer: and draw in their breath until it reaches the palate and comes out above their throat. 
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed many times the school boys do similar to this in schools: and it is an easy thing for one who wishes. 
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out above the nose, and the other which remained in the nose. 
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then administer the sawing of the flesh with the knots that are in the thread. 
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh has been caught with the knots of the thread. 
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread: and place in the nose after cleaning the blood a plug which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remained of the flesh. 
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then at the end of the matter place a lead tube in the nose, for several days, until it heals. 
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it needs treatment that dries, use that. 
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making head-purging, with which oils and other medicines are dripped into the nose, make that from silver, or bronze: which should be similar to a small lamp, open like a small shell: and its passage likewise. 
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish make a closed tube, like a reed. 
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making head-purging should be full, uncovered: which should have a handle at its back, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you want from juices and flowing substances. 
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument. 
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	¶ On the Treatment of Thelul of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25. 
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times Thelul is born at the extremity of the nose, and grows large, and increases with days, until its appearance becomes foul. 
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning of its appearance, and root out all of it. 
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the spot either cautery, or burning medicine which serves in place of it. 
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore its cutting is delayed until it grows large, then consider, if it is stone-like, hard, of dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: since it is a cancerous swelling. 
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For many times I have seen one who cut such a swelling, and great harm occurred from it to the one who had it. 
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the swelling is soft to touch, not of dark color, and you see that cutting is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient, and cut it without fear, without dread: and treat the spot with that which dries and constricts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a break in continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, treatment is of little benefit, except in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore when something of this sort happens to someone, you should consider whether it is a fresh wound with its blood: and then join the two lips of the wound with a suture: then treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the break in continuity are already separated, and each part has become healthy: then you should scrape each part from its visible skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join the two lips with a suture, and bind them, and sprinkle over it dragon's blood and ground frankincense: and place above the powders a piece of diaphoenicon plaster, and some other consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads fall off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is to join the break in continuity, either with needles, as we described in the suture of the belly: or join the break with thread, as I made known to you. 
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of nodes from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Indeed, many people often develop hard swellings similar to vetch seeds on the inside of their lips: and some of them smaller, and larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore you should turn the lip, and cut into each of its nodes, and lift it with a hook, and cut it away from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with ground vitriol, until the bleeding stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then let it be washed with vinegar, and let the area be treated with something astringent, until the wounds heal. 
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the cutting of flesh grown over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often flesh grows over the gum additionally, which the ancients called abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore you should lift it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place ground vitriol on the spot, or other astringent, drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	But if that flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization. 
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, unsightly crusts gather on the surfaces of teeth from the inside and outside, and between the gums, and sometimes they become black, and yellow, and green, until corruption reaches the gum from this, and the teeth become foul because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore you should have the patient sit before you, and their head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth in which crusts and things similar to sand appear to you: until nothing of them remains, and similarly do this with blackness, and greenness, and yellowness, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore what is in them is removed from the beginning of scraping, it is good: and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second, and third time, until finally you achieve what you want.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth needs scrapers of different forms, of many shapes: according to what is prepared for your operation: because the scraper which scrapes the tooth from below is different from the scraper which scrapes between teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of scrapers should be prepared with you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	¶ On extracting tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you treat the tooth and its pain with all skill, and delay its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing that can replace it when it is extracted: since it is an elevated substance: until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary when the patient is forced to extract it, that the painful tooth be confirmed and verified by you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a healthy tooth and extracts it: then the pain does not go away, until the diseased tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have indeed seen this from the work of bloodletters.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the painful tooth itself is verified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a small spatula, in which there should be some force, until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it loose.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps on it with good positioning, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have already held firmly, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from all sides with care, and attempt to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If however the tooth is perforated, or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and tighten it with the end of a fine probe, so that it does not break at the moment of your gripping it with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary, that you act precisely with scarification around the gum from all sides extensively.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and part of it remains, and return to the patient from it an evil which would be greater than his first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste, and their boldness in extracting it, without administering what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For many times they cause great illnesses to happen to people, the more difficult of which are that they break, and all or some of their roots remain: or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have witnessed many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then after its extraction it should be washed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If bleeding occurs from the sites (for it often occurs) then grind some vitriol, and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the vitriol does not help you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved, should be of long tips, short handle, thick, so that they do not bend when pressed upon the tooth with them: they should be as you see of thick handles, so that when you grip with them, they do not give way, nor bend: of short tips, and they should be made of Indian iron, or of steel properly made, with straight tips: and in their tips there should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with proper, strong constraint.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the tips are made like the form of the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, and they are of strong grip.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	¶ On the Extraction of Teeth and Removal of Broken Jaw Bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains broken during the extraction of a tooth, then it is necessary to place cotton with butter on the spot for one or two days, until the area softens: then insert the forceps, or pliers whose tips resemble the beak of a bird called the stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This is the form of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their tips be made like a file on the inside: or like the aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not yield to extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you hollow out above the root, and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be short at the tip, somewhat thick: and not be absorbed, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root comes out by that means, it is good: and if not, one must assist with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	Form of the first with triangular tip, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	Form of the thin triangular tip.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also one is aided by this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and iron tools which preceded in the scraping of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also there is help with this instrument which resembles a large hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular tip, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break: and let it not be absorbed.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that dental instruments are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the prudent craftsman, skilled in his art, finds by himself an instrument, according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves indicate to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For among illnesses there are those for which the ancients did not prescribe an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If however a bone from the jaw breaks, or from other bones of the mouth, or decays: then examine it in its place with what is suitable for it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and assist with the gesti, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be in it some thickness gradually, so that the bone may be gripped, or held with it, and not escape and go away, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is small decay in the bone, then scrape it from its decay, and treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the Filing of Teeth Protruding Above Others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, the form becomes ugly: and especially when this happens in women, and girls, namely those for sale.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not located, or its filing is possible, nor its smoothing: then extract it: and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made from Indian iron, with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cutting with which you cut it be over many days, both because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is protruding exposed to its filing: then file it with a file made of Indian [iron], whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it all be from Indian [iron], and its handle very finely pointed, like the file with which needles are made: with which the tooth should be filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls: then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	But if it is a tooth, from which a part breaks, and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary that you also file it, until the roughness of that break is removed, and it is made even: and smoothed, and does not hurt the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	¶ On Binding Teeth with Gold Wires
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33 
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite firmly on what they eat without it falling, and you have treated them with astringent medicines without success, then the clever solution for them is to bind them with gold wire, since silver turns green and deteriorates after some days, but gold never changes. 
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be medium in thinness and thickness according to the space it must fit between the teeth. 
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And indeed the form of binding is thus: take a wire and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then weave with the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you arrive with the weaving up to a healthy tooth on the other side. 
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving back to the side where you began, and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it does not move at all; and let your tightening with which you secure the wire be at the roots of the teeth, so it doesn't slip away. 
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess wire ends with scissors, and bring both together, and turn them with a tool, and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so they don't harm the tongue; then leave it bound thus while it remains. 
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it loosens or breaks, bind them with another wire, and it will stay thus for the entire time. 
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the binding of two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see. 
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two return after the fall of either in their places, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and none does this except a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman. 
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes something from cow bones is fitted, and is made into the form of a tooth, and is placed in the spot from which the tooth was removed and is bound, as we said; and it remains, and serves for a long time. 
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	¶ On Cutting the Ligament that Occurs Under the Tongue and Prevents Speech
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34 
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed. 
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is thus: open the patient's mouth with their head in your lap, and raise their tongue; then cut that sinewy ligament across its width until the tongue is freed from its restraint. 
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	But if there is any hardness and knotting in it, and this is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and split it across its width until you cut the ligament and the knot is loosened. 
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware lest the cut be too deep in the flesh, and you cut an artery there, and bleeding occurs. 
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then immediately wash the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or cold water. 
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a linen plug, which the patient should keep there every night, so it doesn't heal a second time. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however bleeding occurs, then place ground vitriol on the spot. 
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the blood overwhelms you, then cauterize the spot with a lentil-shaped cautery, which is suitable for this; then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals. 
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	¶ On Removing the Ranula that Forms Under the Tongue
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35 
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an swelling occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural operation; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth. 
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation on it is thus: open the patient's mouth facing the sun, and examine the swelling. 
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it is of a dark or black color, hard, which the patient cannot feel, then do not touch it, for it is cancer. 
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it tends toward whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it and cut it with a fine spatula, and free it from all sides. 
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	But if blood overwhelms you during your operation, then place ground vitriol on it until the blood is stopped; then return to your operation until you extract it completely. 
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with the remaining suitable treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of apostemes (abscesses) of the two Tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36. 
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat godad, that is, glands, which resemble the algodad that occur externally: and they are called the two Tonsils: when you treat them with what we have described in the division, and they do not heal, then consider. 
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore the aposteme is hard, of dark color, with little sensitivity: then do not touch it with iron. 
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it also with iron, fearing blood flow, but rather leave it until it matures. 
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it: or it will break by itself. 
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of white color, round, and its root is thin: then it needs to be cut. 
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is that you should consider before its operation, if its hot aposteme has completely quieted, or has diminished somewhat: then therefore have the patient sit facing the sun, and his head should be in your lap: and open his mouth, and let a servant take between his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, whose form is this. 
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made from silver, or bronze, which should be thin like a small knife. 
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press the tongue with it, and the aposteme is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, without pulling with it anything from the membranes. 
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, whose form is as follows. 
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It resembles scissors: however its ends should be curved, so that the orifice of each of them is directly opposite the other sharply: hence ensure that it is made from Indian iron, or soaked alfuled. 
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this. 
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side. 
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision. 
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water. 
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if bleeding occurs, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate peels have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar astringent things, until the blood flow is stopped: then treat him until he is healed. 
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other apostemes grow in the throat, besides the two tonsils. 
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut them therefore according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally. 
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I indeed once treated a woman for an aposteme, which had grown between her throat, which tended toward darkness, with little sensitivity, which had already nearly closed the throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating, and drinking water: and she would have reached death, if she had remained one day, or two days. 
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the aposteme had ascended so much, that it had sent out two branches, until they came out above the two nostrils. 
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I hurried therefore hastily, and fixed a hook in one of them. 
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I drew it, and a large portion was drawn from it. 
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where I had grasped it from the nostril. 
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to what had proceeded from the other nostril. 
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: and afterward fixed the hook in the aposteme itself: then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood ran from it: therefore the woman's throat was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food. 
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut from that aposteme many times over a long time: and the aposteme would succeed in the place of what I had cut, until it was prolonged excessively with her. 
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I devised, and cauterized the aposteme between the throat. 
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore it stopped from increasing: then I went away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes swollen, and is long: then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in its lower part, then it is called grape-shaped.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we described in the section, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the hot swelling has subsided from it, and it is thin: then it is necessary to cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which of it is collected round, and has no length, and is bloody, or of dark color, or black, and has no feeling: then you must avoid cutting it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in it there is danger to the patient.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore when you see it according to the manner I described with whiteness and length, you should have the patient sit facing the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument, whose description preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula, and pull it downward: and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not cut from it except that which extends beyond the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we described in the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the patient is frightened of the incision: then you must use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cautery in it is only with sharp water: and it is that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I described to you in the chapter on cauterizing, and mix with it unslaked lime, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the cavity of this instrument, whose form is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let its extremity in which the medicine is placed have a cavity like the cavity of a probe's spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself: and let the patient lie on his side, so that saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that none of it descends to his throat and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And press it on the uvula for half an hour, until you see it has become black, and the stinging of the medicine has subsided.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take cotton, and wrap it around the end of the probe, and soak the cotton with the medicine, and insert the probe with the cotton in the tube from above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it: for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and clean what is around it from the medicine: and let it be rinsed with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This type of treatment is therefore safer than incision and further from danger.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the uvula is also treated with what is more subtle than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamint, and hyssop, and oregano, and rue, and sseah, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and let them boil: and let the pot be properly sealed with clay: and let there be in the middle of the pot a hole, over which a hollow instrument is placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made from silver or brass: and let the extremity, in which there is a pomegranate, be inserted into the patient's mouth, until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula becomes quite dark.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times, until it dries up.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of the swelling.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it often increases the swelling: and you should not do it except during the decline of its hot swelling.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed, and attach an eggshell at its end: so that the patient's mouth is not burned: since the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is among the good treatments with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	¶ On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone, or fish bone, or something else gets stuck in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore you should extract what is visible of these upon which sight falls, after you press down the tongue with an instrument in sunlight, and what is in the throat becomes clear to you.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not visible to you and is hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip, or lettuce root, or swallow a morsel of dry bread: or take a piece of soft dried sea sponge: and tie it with a thread, then let him swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it reaches the place where the thorns or bone are, and is withdrawn, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we have mentioned: then use a lead instrument according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be somewhat thicker than a probe, and at its end let there be a curve, which he should insert into his throat with ease: and he should have his head raised upward.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And he should beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing occur, and push the bone or thorn with it, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Indeed it is better that the patient insert it: because of his knowledge of the location of the attached thing: and push downward, or pull his hand with the instrument upward, all that according to the amount that is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	¶ On the extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is treated with what I mentioned in the division about treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then examine the patient's throat in front of the sun, or by the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument I described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps appropriately.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	But if it is not possible with these: then take a hollow reed, and insert it into the patient's throat up to near the throat: then insert into the hollow of the reed an iron heated with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a glass full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow any of it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately falls when it senses water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs, or with asafoetida using the instrument I described for fumigation of the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for it will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot, in which there are live coals with fire: and let the pot be covered with a lid, in whose middle there is a hole: and let the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then cast the fumigation, and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the reed, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is therefore necessary that it come out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when sight falls upon it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of Abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many types of abscesses, of many kinds, according to what has been mentioned about them, namely one by one in this book: and they differ in their perforation and incision in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of these is from the type of abscess itself, and what it contains of fluids.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second way is because of the places in the body where it occurs.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment regarding treatment.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among abscesses there are those which should not be opened except after the maturation of pus in them and its completion: and among them are those which should be opened while they are raw and not fully matured.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses that are near to joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an abscess occurs near a joint and its existence is prolonged until what is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: which is a more immediate cause of contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member: for if you delay its opening until it matures, it will harm either it or through it the principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it while immature: and you should not pierce a raw abscess of incomplete digestion, except what is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or reach a point where it cannot be healed.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You should know the time for opening an abscess that is fully matured: and it is upon the settling of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness and pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you should make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and at its most prominent point: and let the perforation go in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in parts of the hands and feet, and in places of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and finally in all even places which have no bend.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that do bend, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to postpone its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we said, to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that, the flow of virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and dirt, and perhaps its lips and its depth become hardened.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body when necessary: or according to what the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And you should administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a wide perforation: or many incisions according to the similarity of the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are among abscesses those in which it is necessary to hollow out the skin: and cut it when it has already become like cloth, and has reached the point where it is already dead: like that which occurs in many, such as dubelet and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And among them are those which are cut with a triangular incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And among them is that from which is cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the abscess of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those in which a round incision and a lunar incision are administered: and similar ones from incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which has no head, like superficial smooth abscesses, you should pierce it with a superficial or flat perforation only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not hurry and extract all the pus at that time: rather extract a portion of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then plug the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some more pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times gradually until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old man: for the vital spirit often leaves the body with the release of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore be very careful with this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, with which you pierce these abscesses, you should clean the wound: and observe.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is flat, then apply lint made from linen or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures from the perforation, then it is necessary to insert lint into every fissure, until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the abscess you have cut away part of the skin, or hollowed it out around the circumference: then you should fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is woven, or with scraped flax fiber without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and treat it with whatever ointment is necessary, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however bleeding occurs at the time of your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them: and place it over the site of bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If however the bleeding persists, then you should administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and from the division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If however it is in winter time, and the site of the abscess has many nerves: then you should soak the compresses with warm wine and oil: and place them over the areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then you should place compresses soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then you should loosen the abscess, and clean it, and administer in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This therefore is what is necessary to know about the treatment of abscesses in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment chapter by chapter individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the incision of abscesses that occur in the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the types of Nodes, which are contained by tunics that are like sacs to them: as if they were like the crop of a chicken.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their types are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Among them are fatty ones: and among them are those that contain moisture similar to mud: and among them are those that contain moisture similar to ground grain and porridge: and similar things, and among them are those that are stone-hard.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction there is no fear, as long as during their incision no artery presents opposition.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the procedure in cutting them is that you examine them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called the Probe, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains fluid, then cut it with an incision along the length with a superficial cut: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the incision from line b. to line g. Then when the fluid is evacuated, strip away the cyst which contains that fluid, and do not leave any of it at all.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times it returns, if anything of it remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then submerge cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remained of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the cotton with Egyptian [ointment] a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	But if the abscess contains a fatty node: then cut it according to this form, with an incision having the form of a cross: and insert hooks between the two lips of the incision, and strip it away from all sides: and concentrate your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if an artery presents opposition to you, then do what I will tell you later.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in the case of an abscess, if it is stony, with the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision upon a stony abscess is easier: since it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses which are in the head in some people, with which there is absolutely no moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I cut into an abscess in the head of an old woman, and found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone were struck by throwing it, it would wound them.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses occurring in the head, besides these namely abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or place their perforation always at their lower part, so that the flow of pus is eased downward.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with what is suitable for them in terms of treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the Excision of Scrofulas in the Neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These swellings often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And those of them that occur in the neck are single or multiple: and they generate from one another: and every Scrofula among them is within its own membrane, as is the case with nodes and swellings of the head, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the types of these Scrofulas are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them indeed some are stone-like: and some of them contain fluids: and some of them are malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, for the one among them that you see to be of good condition to the touch, whose appearance is close to skin color, and moves in all directions, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the jugular, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you should cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b. to line g. and separate it from all sides: and stretch the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said regarding swellings of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And one must be cautious not to cut a vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the spatula not be too sharp: so that it does not slip in your hand during cutting, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If however you cut a vein, or artery, or it prevents you from operating, then place ground vitriol in the wound, or certain powders which stop blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the swelling subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped at once. Therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then investigate with your index finger if any other small Scrofulas remain: therefore cut them out and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is a large vein at the root of the Scrofula: then you should not cut that Scrofula from its root: rather you should tie it with a strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you have already immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then treat it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole Scrofula is cut out, then you should bring together the two lips of the wound: and suture it immediately, after you see that absolutely no excess remains.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If however you see that excess remains due to the size of the Scrofula, then you should aim to cut its root, and extract it: and apply the suture which we mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And for those Scrofulas which contain fluids, pierce it with a superficial perforation: so that its point of maturation appears to you: and make the perforation from that which follows below the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after perforation, apply dressings with ointment, and similar things, to remove what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound is now clean: then treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	¶ On the incision of the Epiglottis from an abscess occurring inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this incision in the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it: and this is the writing of their discourse.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those having quinsy, the cutting of the Epiglottis should be avoided: since no benefit comes from it: because all the veins and the lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	But in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no disease in the airway, it is necessary to use incision of the Epiglottis, to escape from the destruction that comes from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore when we wish to do this, we should cut the Epiglottis below three rings of the Epiglottis, or four, with a small incision across the width, in that which is between two rings by such an amount, that the cut is in the membrane, not in the cartilage: and this indeed is the suitable place for cutting, since it is devoid of flesh, and blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	But if the physician is timid, then he should stretch the throat skin with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then split the skin, until when he reaches the airway: avoid blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then cut the membrane which we described: and the cutting of the airway is indicated by phlegm which comes out of it, with that which bursts forth, and loss of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the time passes in which suffocation is feared, bring together the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then apply medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis says:
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this discourse which we have related, the explanation is only when they see that one of these abscesses has already blocked the throat of the sick person: and the sick person has been raised above death, and his breath wants to be cut off: they proceed to cut the Epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe through the wound site with some breathing, and be saved from death: and because of this they instructed to leave the wound open, until the malignancy of the disease is consumed, and its malignancy is three days, and almost the same: then therefore they instructed to sew the wound, and treat it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw myself is that a maid took a knife, and put it in her throat, and cut with it part of the lung's airway.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning, like the moaning of the dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I thus uncovered the wound, and found the blood which had come out from the wound was little.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was thus confident that she had not cut a vein, nor the jugular: and wind was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I hurried therefore, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maid, except hoarseness in her voice: and after days she returned to her better conditions.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Hence therefore I say: that in cutting the Epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	¶ On cutting the Hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This Abscess named Hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is of two types: for either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural certainly there is no remedy.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	But the accidental is of two types: of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other type is similar to an abscess which occurs from knotting of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is danger, and one should not make an attempt at it with iron, except in that which is small: and you test it, and investigate it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not suspended with any of the veins: then cut it, as nodes are cut: and extract it with that which contains the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then search out all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with what is necessary from treatment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	¶ On the surgical treatment of various types of Nodes
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of Nodes, and I have already described all their types in the classification: and here I must explain the difference between a Node and an Abscess, since it can cause confusion.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Therefore I say that with an Abscess there is heat, and fever, and severe pains, until the boiling of the superfluity subsides, and putrefaction is complete: for then the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	With a Node however there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and they are contained within a membranous cyst, which is their proper sac, and it is the same color as the body: and they begin the size of a chickpea, and become like a melon, and larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two types: either fatty, or containing fluid.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of the fluid are many, according to what I said in the classification.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to treat a Node, you must examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called the Probe, according to the form that will be shown in the chapter after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigating swellings and all Nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most fluid place that you find in the swelling: and you rotate your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then advance your hand according to the size of the swelling.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Probe and examine what comes out in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore fluid comes out, whatever color it may be: then cut it with a superficial incision, according to what I said regarding other swellings.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no fluid comes out in the track of the Probe, then know that it is fatty: therefore cut over it with a cruciform incision, according to this form, as I taught you: and hold it with hooks, and carefully separate the skin from all sides: and preserve the cyst if you can, so that you may extract it intact with the Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the cyst ruptures during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it intact, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece until none of it remains.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if any of it remains, whether little or much, the Node usually returns.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if it defeats you, and a little remains: then fill the wound upon your completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place upon it what calms a hot swelling, and treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore the Node is large, then suture its two edges, and treat it with what causes flesh to grow.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vein: then hurry and fill the place with ground vitriol, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the blood's boiling subsides: then return to cutting what remained of the Node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	¶ On the forms of instruments for cutting and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Among these are the forms of probes, and they are of three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Of these, one is large, one is medium, and one is small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	They are made of iron with squared ends appropriately, so that they may quickly enter into abscesses.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of probes, and of perforating instruments: and one of them is called beris, that is, perforator: and they are of three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Of these indeed is large, medium, and small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable for investigating abscesses, lesions, fistulas, and swellings from what lies between them in the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, polished, like large needles with which cushions are sewn, made from brass, or from bronze, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those made from brass.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And probes are also made from black lead, which are suitable for examining fistulas that have bends in their cavity, so that they may bend with their smoothness along those curves.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And again they are of three types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For among them are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of hooks, and they are of many types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For among them are simple ones, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three types as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And among them are blind hooks: and they are of three types.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types: and among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three types: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and excoriated: and they are of three types: for among them is large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their ends with which cutting is done are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not made thus, except that with them help may be given in the excoriation of nodes when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that through them the patient may be healed, and find some relief from the burning which occurs during the excoriation of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are probes (Magda), and they are of three types.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of bronze, and are similar to the stick with which kohl is applied: and in the broad end there is a hidden spatula point: and in it runs to the interior and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of spatulas which are hidden between the fingers when perforating abscesses: and patients do not perceive them: and they are of three types, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of cupping vessels with which blood flow is stopped: and they are of three types, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat elongated, as you see: and they should be rather thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these types of cupping vessels be available to you, large and small: so that you may stop blood flow quickly when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for stopping blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the muscles of the leg, and thigh, and muscles of the arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar to these, from among the fleshy, moist muscles.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes small instruments are made from these similar to pistachio shells, according to their form: with which blood is stopped when it flows from the place of bloodletting, or during the cutting of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the treatment of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to have nocturnal emissions) until they resemble women's breasts: and they remain swollen in an unsightly way.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever abhors this condition should cut above the breasts with a lunar incision, according to this form from line b. to line g. Then strip away all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterward, fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the breast droops downward and becomes soft due to its size, as happens in women: then it is necessary to make two incisions on its upper sides similar to the lunar figure, each of which connects with the other at both ends, so that the larger line contains the smaller one, according to this form from line b. to line g. Afterward strip away the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we mentioned about sutures and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If however you cannot complete the incision of what you need to cut, due to the patient's restlessness, or due to blood flow: then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the perforation of swellings that occur under the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These swellings that occur under the armpit are of the types of hard scrofula which contain cysts, and some of them contain fluids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore those of them which contain fluids should be cut with a lunar incision, according to this form, from line b. to line g. When therefore all the pus that is in the swelling is evacuated, then fill it with old cotton, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the cotton, and treat it with suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	But if the swelling is of the type of scrofulous nodes, then cut into it, just as we described in the section on scrofula similarly.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however the wound extends to emit pus, then apply cautery to it, according to what we described previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On cutting swellings that occur due to arteries and veins.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery ruptures, and the skin above it heals over, then often a swelling occurs from this: and similarly it happens with veins also, that swelling and inflammation occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the swelling and inflammation are due to an artery and vein are: that when the swelling is due to an artery, it is long, gathered in the depth of the body: and when you push the swelling with your fingers, you feel as if it has a whistling sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round and visible on the body's surface.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And cutting into this type of swelling is an error, especially that which is under the armpits, and groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very dangerous.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore its treatment with iron [surgical instruments] should be avoided, and those of them which are in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore for that which is from inflation of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, then the artery: and free it from its coverings, until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the swelling is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment which generates pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterward treat it with ointments suitable for that, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If there is an abscess due to cutting a vein, then you should hold with your hand as much of the abscess with the skin as you can.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind the abscess with this thread with a good binding: according to what I told you about binding a grape, from two parts with the two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you fear that the thread might come out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess near the first needle's incision: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is inside comes out: then cut away the excess skin, and leave what is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place upon it a compress which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment, which is done with lint and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	¶ Concerning the abscess which occurs from twisting of Nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in Artery and Vein, similarly an abscess occurs in Nerves: which occurs in them from a blow, or occurs from excessive work, and similar things: and it happens most often in those places of the upper arms, or heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles the rest of the body, and is in most conditions without pain: and when it is pressed firmly, the patient feels something like numbness in it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess gathered in the depth of the body, but rather is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward, or ahead, nor backward to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore those of them that are in joints, should not be invaded with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps contraction will occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is of them in the head, or in the forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore the abscess is small, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it: then remove it, and join the wound with suture: and treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	¶ Concerning the cutting of an abscess, which occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	There occur in some people many times in their bellies, and in other parts of their bodies, warts, which are called Fungal, due to their similarity with mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is thin, and their head is thick, and their edges are turned outward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small: and some of them become very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I indeed have seen a man, and in his belly there were two warts, which were more similar to mushrooms than other things: there was no difference between them, white, of minute root, and their edges were turned outward, and they were split, and moisture always ran from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore I cut them, and found in the weight of one about 18 ounces and in the other about 6 ounces And the operation in cutting them is, that you consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the wart is white, moist, of thin root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and let there be cauteries in the fire in your presence.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For many times during its cutting much blood is expelled: hurry therefore if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	But if you see the patient fearful and afraid of cutting with iron, then take a thread of lead properly made, and bind the wart with it: whose method is what we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then increase in the tightness of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease to tighten the lead, as often as it makes an impression in the wart, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the wart should be of thick root, then in cutting it there is something of fear and dread: especially that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless it is possible, that you cut half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it, until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to cut a wart which is of dark color, of little sensation, of foul appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess: and I will come with the remembrance of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the Treatment of Protruding Navel.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	A protruding navel occurs from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Either from tears in the sifac [abdominal wall] which is above the belly: and from it emerges the althub [omentum], or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a Vein, or from an Artery, according to what was mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from trapped wind in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is due to a tear in the sifac, and exit of the omentum: then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body: and it is smooth, without pain: and appears in different positions.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of intestine, then its position, with what we have described, is of greater variability.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears: then returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it greatly increases upon entering the bath, and with vigorous exercise.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If indeed it is due to fluid, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	But if it is due to blood, then with these signs the swelling appears declining toward blackness.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is due to grown flesh: then the swelling is heavy, thick, hard, and fixed in one size.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If indeed it is due to wind, then its touch is smooth.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the procedure in that case is, that you should consider then, if the protrusion of the navel is due to blood from an Artery, or Vein, or wind: then you must refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of swellings due to artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	But if the protrusion of the navel is due to intestine, or omentum: then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and stand upright extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterward command them to lie back between your hands upon their back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel above the place which you marked with ink.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterward extend the middle of the swelling upward, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind it around firmly with thread, or with silk cord in a secure binding: and let the knot of the binding be of the alenxotati type [special surgical knot].
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the swelling extended above the binding.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it has been caught by the binding: then remove the alenxotati, and insert your index finger, and push the intestine to the interior of the belly: and if you find omentum, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however an artery or vein opposes you: then encircle it extensively.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your procedure.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads: and insert the two needles around what you made around the swelling in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the swelling in four places above the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefied.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if the protrusion of the navel is from flesh grown in it, or from fluid: then you must hollow out the swelling, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or fluid, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what solidifies the area.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	On the treatment of CANCER.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already discussed in the classification the types of Cancer, and how it may be treated with medicines: and that treatment with iron [surgery] should be avoided, lest it become ulcerated: and we discussed Cancer generated in the womb, and the precaution in treating it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: like Cancer that is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar ones, from members situated for extracting all of it: especially when it is small and beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is old and large, you should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I have not been able to cure any of it: nor have I seen another before me who achieved that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is situated as we said, is that you should proceed first and purge the patient of black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then bleed them if you find obvious fullness [of blood].
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with preparation, in which they are positioned for the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then cast suitable hooks into the Cancer.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards hollow it out from all sides with the skin, according to careful examination, until none of its roots remain: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it off quickly, rather compress the areas, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however the flow of thick blood from cutting an artery or vein gives you trouble: then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the treatment of DROPSY.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already described in the classification the types of Dropsy, and how water accumulates: and the signs of every type, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is only the ascitic type alone: and the tympanitic type should not be approached with iron: nor the hyposarca type at all: for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this tympanitic type of Dropsy with medicines, and your treatment has not helped: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already followed in the patient, or there is another illness besides Dropsy: such as if they have a cough, or looseness of the belly, and similar things: then beware of treating them with iron: since that is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see the patient has abundant strength, and they have no illness besides Dropsy alone: and is neither a child nor elderly: then the method of operation on them is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and an assistant behind them compresses their belly with their hand pushing the water to the lower part of the pubic area.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spiny spatula, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with a sharp end like a Spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However let there be some gradual shortness in it, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation all the way to the intestine, and harm it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of Dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then you should distance yourself with the incision from the navel by the amount of three fingers, downward in line with it above the pubic area.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If however the generation of Dropsy is due to illness of the liver: then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and also the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wants to lie, so that excess fluids do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce through the whole skin with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into that incision, and raise your hand with the Spatula between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are skinning it: and let the amount that is skinned be the amount of a fingernail, or thereabouts.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the peritoneum, until the Spatula reaches the empty space: which is the place of the water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then remove it, and introduce into the hole an instrument, of which this is the form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a small tube: made from silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: which has a small hole in its lower part, and in its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and its end is cut, in the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate half the quantity of water at that time.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Since if you evacuate more of it than necessary, at that moment the patient may die through the dissolution of his vital spirit: or he may suffer a fainting spell that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Indeed, evacuate from it according to the measure of his strength, and according to what the patient's conditions indicate to you from his pulse strength, and from its quality.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is because it is retained immediately due to the skin that holds the opening which is above the peritoneum: about which I told you to pierce it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument the next day, if you see the patient can tolerate it: and draw out also a small quantity of water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until nothing remains of the water except a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are worried about the patient, and you leave much water: then treat him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in the bath and sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after extracting the water: according to what I described in what preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	¶ Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any of the infants emerges from his mother's womb, and the head of his penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when he is born with a very fine probe, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place in the opening a thin nail of lead, and bind it: and keep it there for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	Therefore when he wants to urinate, let it be removed, and let him urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then replace it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead, it is indeed possible that the urine which flows over the area will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	Which is because among those who are born, the opening is at the end of the head of the penis: wherefore he cannot urinate forward, until he lifts the penis with his hand upward.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor does he have procreation, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in that case is that the patient should lie back upon his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with strong extension, and cut the tip of the head of the penis from the place of the priapus, with a sharp point, or sharp probe: like the cutting of a reed, or as you scrape something, so that its middle comes to resemble the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And guard yourself during your operation from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore oppose it with that which stops blood, and treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	¶ On Albather (warts) which occur on the foreskin and head of the penis, and on corruption, blackening, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These Albather often occur on the penis, and it is an emergence of unsightly flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And of these, some are malignant, and others non-malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine hook, and cut it away until you have cleaned it all away.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon it cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterward with diafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	But if the Albather is malignant, of foul color, then you should apply cautery to it after cutting and scraping it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If however the Albather is on the foreskin of one uncircumcised, and part of the Albather is between the foreskin and part of it outside: then you should first remove the Albather that is inside, until when it heals, then treat it externally: because when you treat it all at once, the foreskin is not secured from being perforated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And blackening and corruption also occur in the testicles and foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should hollow out all that has already blackened, and what is about to corrupt, or has already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then spread over it afterward honey that has been mixed with powder of pomegranate peels, and sifted ground vetch.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however there occurs a flow of blood, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is beneficial for two conditions simultaneously, namely for blood flow, and when the wound becomes corrupt.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	But if the head of the penis is corroded, and is completely destroyed in an hour: then you should insert into the urinary passage a small tube of lead, so that the patient may urinate through it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	Regarding adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion indeed does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required on it: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound or abscess: therefore you should separate it with a blunt spatula until the attachment is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	But if it is difficult to separate them precisely, then you should scrape something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it becomes perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has been moistened in cold water, so they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then let it be treated with astringent wine until it heals.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of errors occurring to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a break in continuity like other wounds: however, since it is done by our operation, by our will, and its practice is specifically for boys, it is necessary that we indicate in it the better operation and the easier way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: since they do not use it in their laws, and it is nothing except what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Which is because I found the greater part of practitioners and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors: and they use the thimble, and binding with thread, and cutting with a fingernail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I indeed have already tested all these methods, and have not found better than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Since in cleansing with a razor, many times the skin escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower membrane remains: thus one is forced to cut to cut the other, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with cleansing which is done through the thimble, that is, the finger-guard which cobblers use, the cutting of the extremity of the male member is not secured: since perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with the fingernail, perhaps the iron slips and corrupts your operation: and indeed a boy's skin is naturally short, and many times they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, cleansing with scissors and binding with thread, good experience has revealed to me: since scissors are of proportional cutting: because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore when you press your hand, the two sharp edges are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation in one time: and the compression happens in a similar figure, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, with which error does not occur at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the mode of proper operation is that you make estimate, especially the boy, if he is among those who understand a little, that you do nothing except that you bind a thread on his penis only: and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him happy and joyful in every way possible for you, from that which his understanding receives.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands in position, and let him not be sitting: and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, lest the boy see them at all, or any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand to his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it upward, until the head of the penis comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it from that which gathers in it of dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterward bind a little below it with a second binding.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower binding with good retention, and cut between the two bindings.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upward quickly, and extract the head of the penis.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run gradually (for it is better) and put powder above: and above the powder a cloth in which has been spread egg yolk cooked in rose water, mixed with fresh good rose oil: and leave it upon him until another day: and treat him with the remaining treatment until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	However, this is the form of scissors for cleansing.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two extremities be blunt, and let them be cutting: let no branch of nail protrude in them: and let the length of the two sharp edges be like the length of the two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	Indeed the error falling in cleansing is: since perhaps the inner skin escapes entirely, or part of it during cutting.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your time with your nail before swelling of the place: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If three days have passed, and what remains under the penis is swollen and inflamed: then leave it until the hot inflammation subsides, and carefully remove the skin, and cut it according to what is prepared for you: and be careful of the head of the penis.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	Indeed this will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore treat it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders, which we described in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut from the skin above measure, and escapes to the upper parts, this also does not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	¶ On the extraction of Urine retained in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from blockage caused by stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh growth, and similar things from those which we mentioned in the types of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the Urine is not released, and you see its retention is because of a Stone, which is now in the neck of the bladder: then the patient should be on his knees bent over.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore he is compelled with the neck of the bladder to expel the Stone to the posterior: whereby the Urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	But if it is not released with what we have said, and the matter becomes severe for the patient: then you must administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's feather quill in the thinness of its shaft, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: which should have a thin tube at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of urine's exit through it is that you should take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton at its end with a good knot: and insert the end of the thread in the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with scissors if anything from the wool protrudes, but insert it into the tube with force, like alzer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and have the patient sit on a seat, and bathe the bladder and his penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the penis carefully, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above from the region of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe within it, until it reaches the Bladder, and the patient feels that it has already reached an empty space: and this does not happen according to this order, except because the passage, in which it goes, is one in which there is tortuosity.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with the wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it, and make the Urine flow through the urinary path: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease doing this, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	¶ On the method of administering an enema to the bladder with a Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus becomes confined in it, and you want to instill waters and medicines into it: then it should be done with an instrument which is called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the hollow space, in which is that which pushes, should be of such size that it blocks itself without addition, until when something is drawn with it, from the fluids it is drawn up: and when it is pushed, with it it is expelled to a distance: just as does the clepsydra, with which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is thrown in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore when you want to inject fluids into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the fluid, and draw with that which pushes upwards, for the fluid is drawn into the cavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its end into the penis, according to what we described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the fluid with that which pushes for that fluid reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form of the fine clyster with which the bladder is given an enema.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made from silver, or brass: whose higher end should be similar to a small alcama, and below it a cavity between which the ligament may fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a ram's bladder, and put in it the fluid with which you wish to give an enema to the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two cavities with a strong binding with a double thread: and warm that fluid a little over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the clyster into the penis, afterwards squeeze your hand over the bladder with the fluid with proper pressure, until the patient feels that the fluid has now reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment, and make from it a circle, and perforate it around its whole circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread in those holes, as they are wound around.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as the alsofratu is gathered: after you put in it what you want from fluids, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand, until the fluid reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On the extraction of Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken about the division of types of Stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have spoken about the difference between Stone generated in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs of all that: and I have spoken about Stone in which operation by hand and cutting is appropriate: and it is Stone generated specifically in the bladder: and that which becomes fixed in the penis: and I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore I say that Stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its thinness: and white sand appears in it, and the patient rubs his penis, and struggles with it, and many times it hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it becomes erect, and the anus comes out with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of boys is easy, from it until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old men.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In young men however it is intermediate, in what is between that: and he whose Stone is larger, treatment is easier: and if small, its treatment is the opposite of that.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore when we come to treatment, it is necessary first that we clean out the patient with an enema, which extracts all the feces that is in his intestines: for it sometimes prevents the finding of the Stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the patient be taken by his feet, and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the Stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or let him jump from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder becomes inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him from the outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the Stone in the space, then proceed immediately with an incision over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it cannot be felt under your touch at all, then you must clean the index finger with oil of your left hand, if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if it is a grown youth: and insert it into his anus, and search for the Stone, until it comes under your finger: and gradually turn it toward the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outward toward the place where you wish to make the incision: and instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to pull the testicles upward with his right hand: and with his other hand, to remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the cutting Spatula, whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And make an incision in the area between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, but to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be over the stone itself, with your finger in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the external cut is wide and internally narrow, according to the size that would allow the Stone's exit, no larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger that is in the anus compresses the Stone at the incision, and it exits without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that among Stones there are those that have angles and edges, which makes their exit difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And among them are smooth ones, similar to an acorn, and round: and their exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	For those that have angles and edges, increase the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit thus, then you must devise a way to deal with it: either grip it with a suitable instrument whose tip is like a Moon, which grips the Stone and doesn't let it escape: or introduce beneath it a thin instrument with a curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If however you cannot manage it, then widen the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If some blood overcomes you, stanch it with vitriol.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If the stone is more than one, then first push the large one to the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterward push the small one after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut over it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For one of two things happens to the patient, either he dies, or continuous urinary dripping occurs: because the area does not heal completely.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Rather, manage its expulsion until it exits: or devise a way to break it with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: to calm the hot swelling.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the patient back on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you have loosened it, bathe the area with water and plenty of oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diaphoenicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however there occurs in the wound increased hot swelling, and erosion, and similar things: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented because of it: and this is recognized by the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it leads to corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and counter each type with what is suitable from the treatment, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during all hours of treatment to bind the two thighs together, and gather them, because of the medicines which are placed over the area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and is lodged in the passage of the penis, and gets stuck there, and blocks the exit of urine: then treat it with what I will describe before you proceed to cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times you may be spared from cutting through this treatment, as I have indeed proven it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is that you should take a Perforator made of iron from Africa, which has this form: with a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie the penis with it below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the perforating iron into the penis carefully, until the Perforator reaches the stone itself: and rotate the Perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and attempt to perforate it until you make it penetrate through the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For the urine is released immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand over what remains of the stone on the external part of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks and exits with the urine, and the patient is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not suitable for you, due to something that prevents it: then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone in the penis itself between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterward, loosen the binding, and clean away the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And the binding of the thread below the stone is only necessary so that it does not return to the bladder: and the other binding above, only so that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upward, so that it returns upon your completion and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	¶ On the Extraction of Stones in Women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stone rarely forms in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if a stone occurs in any of them, then the treatment is difficult and is prevented for many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a doctor, when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially operation by hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance to the location of the stone: wherefore it requires deep cutting, and in that there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	But if necessity drives to that, then it is proper that you take a female physician, well-knowledgeable: and few are found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you are deprived of her, then seek a chaste, skilled physician, and present a midwife well-trained in women's matters, or a woman who in this art suggests a portion of skill: therefore make her present, and instruct her especially, that she do everything that you instruct her regarding the investigation of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First what is necessary, is that she look if the woman is a virgin: then it is proper that she insert her finger into her anus, and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, let her constrain it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the patient, and investigate the stone, after she places her left hand over the bladder, and compresses it with good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone, then it is proper that she gradually move it from the orifice of the bladder downward with the full extent of her strength, until she arrives with it at the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then let her cut above it at the opposition of the middle of the vulva at the root of the hip, from whichever part is prepared for her, and feels the stone in that part: and let her finger not be removed from the stone, constraining under it: and let the cut be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then let her insert the probe over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore she feels the stone, then let her increase the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone exits from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	Know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Among these there is small and large, smooth and rough, long and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore know its types, so that through this you may be informed about what you want.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood overcomes you, then add ground vitriol to the place, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and prepare with you the instruments which I mentioned for extracting stones in men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the discharge of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with bandages with proper binding: and do not change it: and leave the stone, do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the sick woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	¶ On cutting for watery Hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is nothing but a collection of fluid in the white sifac [membrane], which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own proper membrane, which nature prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is thought: that it is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we mentioned: and this happens only rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter flows to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this fluid has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its color tends toward yellow, or it is bloody red, or murky, black, or it is watery white, and this is what is more common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white sifac which we mentioned, then the swelling is round with slight length like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, since the fluid contains it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the fluid is in its own proper membrane, then the swelling is round with part of the egg, and because of this one thinks that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the fluid is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under perception.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you want knowledge of the color of the fluid, then test the color of the fluid in the swelling with the square probe, whose form preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that therefore which comes out in the trace of the probe, judge what is within it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to treatment with the iron [surgical instrument], then it is necessary that you order the patient to be bled if that is possible for him, and you see his body is full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let him lie back on his back on something slightly elevated, and place many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left, and order the assistant to sit on his right, who should extend his penis to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the abdomen wall.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, up to near the pubis: and let the cut be according to the straightness of the parallel line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the containing white sifac: and excise it and observe, or beware of this, that you cut it: and let your excision by which you excise it be from the part which is suspended with the egg more: and carefully scrutinize with the excision according to the amount that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then perforate the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the cut with hooks, and extend the sifac upward, and do not touch the containing skin of the testicles: and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either in its totality, or piece by piece, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine in cutting it, there is no security that the water will not return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the egg proceeds outside from its skin at the time of your operation: then when you will have completed the cutting of the sifac, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it like other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find the testicle corrupted by another blackness, then you must tie off the vessels which are the suspensory, fearing blood flow.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspensory, and remove the testicle: afterward treat it as we have described.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water is collected in both parts, then know that there are two hernias: therefore cut the other part just as you did in the first one equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is suitable for you to make it one operation, then do so: then wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the abdominal wall: and place folded cloths above, which are small cushions: and tie them above with a bandage, which has six [parts] according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then let two cloths be taken and sewn, and filled with carded wool, according to this likeness: and let the ends which press be made from cotton, or moist wool: and let them be gathered with tightness in the waistband of the breeches: and let one end extend over the anus up to the back, and the second extend to the pubic region: and two ends over the two thighs below, and two other ends over the two groins, and let all the tightness be gathered in the waistband of the breeches.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this hernia is skillfully treated with cautery in place of cutting with iron: that is, take a fine knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have described: until when the white membrane containing the water is exposed: then take a cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It resembles a Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce that membrane with it while it is heated, until all the fluid comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch the membrane with hooks, and strip it away with a fine heated cautery, and cut it as much as is possible for you, until you remove all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful of the testicle, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If however during the time of cutting, or during the time of cautery, you encounter opposition from a hot swelling, or blood flow, or something else: then you must treat whatever opposes you from that with the treatment that suits it, according to what was previously stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If however the patient is fearful, and does not await this operation, because of its horribleness: then perform the perforation according to what I describe: which is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certain to you through what we said about the signs, that the hernia is watery: then you must have the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the swelling in its lower part with a broad spatula: and make the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place cotton on the spot, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water runs out: then treat it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however there is resistance to the water's exit at the time when you pierce it: and this is only because the white membrane creates resistance at the opening of the wound, and prevents the water's exit: then you must insert a quill into the wound, or the instrument with which dropsy water is extracted, whose form was described before: or increase the operation of the wound slightly.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	Therefore when it collects, let it be pierced in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	¶ On the treatment of fleshy hernias.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in cutting into this hernia, there is a fear leading to destruction in most conditions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me better to leave it alone than to operate on it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am recalling the operation for it, and the types of swelling.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore, that many swellings occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed: and this happens from many causes, namely:
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Either from sharp or acrid excess fluid, which flows down to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the swelling matches the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a heavy swelling.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone-like swelling, whose color is dark, and it has no sensation.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it occurs from knotting of arteries, and their inflation: as has already been mentioned before: or from inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is from inflation of arteries is recognized by the condition of the swelling, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which occurs from inflation of veins does not disperse at all when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is indeed possible that an incision be made on this type and on the remaining flesh: that is, that you cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then pull the egg upward, and extract it with the white membrane: and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie off the vessels: and cut the suspensory after you free it from every part of the egg parts.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg is consolidated with those grown flesh parts, then you must pull the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between any part of the membrane, or in what is between the vessels: then you must free all that adhesion, and cut it with a circular incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however there is flesh growth in the place of adhesion which is behind: then you must cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	¶ On the treatment of hernia which is with Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Vine is a swelling wrapped in a certain wrapping, similar to a grape cluster, with softening of the testicles: and movement and exercise become difficult for the patient, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which was mentioned before.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary that we describe the operation for it according to what the ancients did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that you must have the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspensory of the testicles downward.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the vessels that are near the penis: and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad sharp spatula a transverse incision in line with the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then peel back from every part, as we told you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterward fix in them a needle in which is a double thread, and tie it in the first of the places where the Vines occur: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is collected from the corrupt feculent fluids.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which you want pus to form, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles fall off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For there is no harm in that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If however Vine occurs in all vessels, then you must extract the testicles with the vessels because of this: so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and wastes away, or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the Treatment of Intestinal Hernia.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The occurrence of this hernia is from a tear that happens in the peritoneum stretched over the belly in the region of the groin from the abdominal wall.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the peritoneum, or from its stretching.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or jumping, or shouting, or lifting a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from stretching of the peritoneum:
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and the swelling is even towards the depth: because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign when it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that it causes from its beginning a sudden severe pain: and the swelling is irregular, appearing close under the skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its path to the outside of the peritoneum.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes the omentum comes out with the intestine: and this is called intestinal and omental hernia: and sometimes it occurs with gas.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces run into the intestine, and are retained there: and with this is the patient's peril: since it causes terrible pain, and especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of the types of this disease with iron [surgery] there is fear: therefore one must be cautious of mishap in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand to the interior of its cavity, if it submits to return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he should lie back upon his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut the whole skin of the testicles lengthwise.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and let the incision be of such size that it is possible for an egg to come out through it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then strip away the covering membrane and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard peritoneum is exposed from all sides: then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between the white peritoneum, which is under the egg's skin, and between the second peritoneum, and free with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move the skin of the testicles inward with your right hand: and with this pull the white peritoneum upward with your left hand: and lift the egg with the peritoneum to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to pull the egg upward: and you release the adhesion which is behind with complete separation.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers so that there is not anything there from the intestine wrapped in the hard white peritoneum.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find something of it: then push it down into the belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle in which there is a thick thread, made into a wick from ten threads: and insert it at the end of the peritoneum, that is, of the membrane which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the ends which protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over others in the form of a cross: and tie with them the peritoneum, of which we spoke, which is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until none of the vessels which nourish them can send anything to them: so that no hot swelling occurs from it.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures leave from the peritoneum, which is under the skin of the testicles, the quantity of the size of a finger: and cut all the rest according to the circle, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles an incision, from which blood and pus flows: as we narrated in what was presented before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place in the wound: and apply the ligature which we described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white peritoneum which we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision fearing the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For many times that happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its falling is delayed, then foment it with hot water: and place upon it that which we mentioned, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	¶ Concerning windy hernia.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this type of hernia, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron [surgical instruments].
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And indeed the ancients said that it is done as we described in the hernia which is with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, that you should bind the vessels after cutting above them with care below: then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with what opens it, until the vessels fall off: and treat the wound, according to what we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	¶ Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all times: but if time prolongs with it, the fissure in the peritoneum increases, until the intestines descend into the peritoneum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this occurs from the extension of the peritoneum, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the peritoneum stretches: then it softens, and the area swells, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with cautery, as was previously described.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron [surgical instruments], in this way: that is, that the patient should lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the swollen and protruding area of the rupture, with a cut across the width, about three fingers wide.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then compress the peritoneum and what is under the skin, until when the white peritoneum that is under the skin following it is exposed.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a probe, and place it over the protruding area of the peritoneum, and press it toward the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew the two protruding places over the end of the probe from the peritoneum, and bind them together with sutures: then remove the end of the probe.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor stretch an egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you therefore cut the threads, clean it, and restore the wound, until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Indeed the peritoneum contracts, and the protrusion of the rupture does not increase.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place: since it is closer to safety.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Often the skin of the testicles becomes soft in some men, because the flesh between them softens, and its appearance becomes unsightly.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for one who is asked to treat it, to make the patient lie on his back, and cut all the skin that has softened above the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then join the two lips with sutures: and if you wish, first sew the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat with the treatment of other wounds, until it heals, and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	¶ Concerning Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that Castration in our law is excommunicated: and because of that it would be permitted for me not to mention it in this book of mine: and its mention is not necessary, except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be in the physician's knowledge when he is asked about it: and that he should know its treatment when it happens to someone.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals, for our benefit through that, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that Castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Either through crushing.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or through splitting and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done through crushing, the way of operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water, until its testicles soften, and become smooth, and hang down: then crush them with your hand, until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration through splitting and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory, and cut above each egg with one cut, until when the two eggs come out: then cut them after you have skinned both, and do not leave on them any of the peritoneum except the thin peritoneum, which is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done through crushing: since crushing perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the treatment of two types of Hermaphrodites.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite in men exists in two forms.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is when there appears in the following space, or in the skin of the testicles, in what is between the two testicles, a structure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women however there is one type, and it is when a woman's vulva above the pubic area has what look like very small male testicles, protruding outward: of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three types, two in men and one type in women, is: that you should cut away the additional flesh until their impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them like other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second type in men, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On cutting the Clitoris and protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The clitoris sometimes grows beyond what is natural, until its appearance becomes unsightly and ugly: and sometimes in certain women it grows so much that it expands like in men, and reaches the point of coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore you should hold the excess of the Clitoris with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it: and do not cut too deeply, especially at the deep root: so that bleeding does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it like wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The grown flesh is flesh that grows in the opening of the womb, until it fills it: and sometimes it extends outward like a tail: and because of this some of the ancients call the condition "tailed."
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore we should cut it as we cut the Clitoris, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of Alratica, which is an unpierced woman's vulva.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is when a woman's vulva is not pierced, or has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental type is from a previous illness: and it indeed occurs either from additional grown flesh, or from thin or thick membrane: and occurs either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents coitus and pregnancy, and birth, and sometimes prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of it comes through the midwife's examination, if the blockage is visible and close.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not visible, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the blockage is from thin membrane, and is close to the two lips: then proceed quickly, and break it open.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is done by placing cushions under the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place the index fingers of your two hands together, and the woman should lie on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch the two lips forcefully, until the thin membrane breaks, and the blockage opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman have intercourse every day, so that the area does not heal over again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the membrane is thick, dense: then you should cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the blockage is from grown flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and have with you medicines that stop bleeding without causing pain, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then apply a wide lead tube, so that the wound does not heal too quickly, keep it there for several days: and apply a dry linen wick, then treat with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes other flesh growths occur in the womb: therefore they should be cut according to this method: as long as it is not a cancerous tumor for a cancerous tumor that is in the womb should not be opposed with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, athehelil, and red bothor in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed openings of vein orifices, from which much blood flows continuously.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids become old, they become thelil: and I have already discussed their types in the classification, and their signs: and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb and are not apparent to the senses: then there is no treatment with iron [surgical instruments].
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	However, those of them that are in the orifice of the womb which can be sensed are those which can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore it is necessary to bring the woman into a cold room.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the athehelil with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder them during the blood flow with one of the cutting powders without causing pain: such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then have her press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the blood flow persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rinds, galls, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is stopped with this, it is good: and if not, apply cupping vessels to the back and breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and submerge it in tarathit juice, or plantain juice, or juice of alaulat branches, that is, oak, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the area.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the swelling subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The red albarth is similar to the heads of alhaasse, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that you cut what appears of it, according to what I said about thelil equally: and treat it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	On the perforation of Swelling which occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many types of swellings occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony swelling, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, gangrene, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and hot swelling.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already discussed all these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the classification: it is necessary that I discuss in this treatise the hot swelling that occurs in the womb, when it is among the swellings that collect pus, and you want to know how its opening is made with iron [surgical instruments].
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the swelling in its beginning is acute with its striking, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it redden: if sensation falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps with maturation, until when the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that has two seats, and let her recline, or lean back on her back, and gather her feet to the lower part of her belly: and let her thighs be spread, and let her place her arms under her knees, and bind both with a binding suitable for that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit at the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those which are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you want to administer this instrument, that you fix with the Probe the depth of the woman's womb: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harm the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If however the instrument should be greater than the depth, then it is necessary that you place small cushions above the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb is prevented: and it is necessary that she place the pivot, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that she hold the instrument, and that the assistant turn the pivot, until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore a swelling appears, and is touched by hand, and is soft and yielding: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a pledget soaked in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the pledget, and draw out the incision in the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally over the womb and over the pubic region clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then after two days it should be treated with an ointment that is suitable for that, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, such that it is cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which lily root or long birthwort has been boiled: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	But if the wound should be hidden inside the womb, then you must refrain from treating it with iron, rather treat it with what we have described in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	¶ Instructions for Midwives, how they should treat living embryos that have emerged in an unnatural position.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 75.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the Midwife to know first the form of natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Among its signs therefore is that when you see a woman bearing down, and desiring to breathe air, and what is above her of the birth becomes lighter for her, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then know that this birth is according to the natural position, and its exit is upon its head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluities with good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But that which is other than this birth is unnatural, unfavorable.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and one hand, or one foot: or its head and its hands emerge: or it emerges belly-first: and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar unfavorable positions.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary therefore for the Midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every position of these, and what the technique is in it, and it is signified through that, and one should stand upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges upon its head in its natural emergence, and this becomes difficult for the woman, and birth becomes hard for her, and you see her strength now weakened: then make her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her: and steam her vulva with cooked fenugreek, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then let the Midwife introduce between her fingers a small spatula, and split with it the afterbirth, and cut it with her nail, until what is in it of moisture runs out: and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If however it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her after the enema to bear down: and make her sneeze with condisi, and hold her mouth and her nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will emerge immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	But if two hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary that you return them with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If however it does not obey in entering, then place the woman upon a seat, and raise her feet upward: then shake the seat upon the ground: and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies: then cut them, and extract the remainder of the fetus: and bind its hand with cloth, and extract it with evenness: for it will emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	¶ Exit of the embryo by its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out by its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward: then turn the fetus gradually: afterwards straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When therefore they come out up to the hips, then instruct her to push, and make her sneeze with condisi: for it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually, until you place it according to the natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then come out with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	And if it is prevented with all that we have described: then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound everything in a mortar with good pounding: then anoint with it the woman's vulva, and lower belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in tepid water, until it reaches the hypochondria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that her lower parts have been warmed, then make for her a suppository of myrrh: and insert it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore she holds the suppository for one hour, then make her sit upon a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and close her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	¶ Exit of the fetus upon knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this form, then be ingenious in introducing your hands gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then let the woman lie back upon her neck, and let her feet hang downward: and let her be lying upon a bed, and fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press above her belly gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take its feet, and move them with vigorous motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypochondria gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let her introduce her hands, and straighten the fetus gradually: and instruct the woman to push, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	¶ Exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Be ingenious in returning its hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however one cannot return it, then raise the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If truly she cannot walk, then make her lie upon a bed: and shake her legs with vigorous shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you prepared from the mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If labor takes her, then make her sit upon a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then work on returning the hand, and straighten the fetus according to the natural position: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to push herself, until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	¶ Exit of the fetus upon its neck, with hands spread, and its face is to its mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the Midwife hold the hand of the fetus, then turn it gradually, and straighten it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When therefore it is straightened, then place upon her vulva what we described of oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When therefore you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and instruct her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to push: and make her sneeze with condisi.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	¶ Exit of the fetus prepared upon the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb according to this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail, until it is emptied of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus to the interior, until you place it according to what is necessary: and instruct the woman to push herself several times: for it will come out with a light exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	On the Delivery of Twins or Multiple Fetuses:
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born: and sometimes three and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is unusual, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five indeed is something against nature, and they do not live at all: and one placenta contains them, however many they may be: and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing between them, attached to each of their umbilical cords.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out as one fetus does in a natural, easy delivery: and they come out in an unfavorable delivery, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	But if some of them are difficult during birth, and arrive in what we mentioned about unnatural positions, then treat them as we have described: and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and patience, and let her be ingenious according to each position with what is prepared for her from ingenuity leading to safety.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	On the Remembrance of What Forms in the Womb from Embryos, and Abortions:
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten form in the womb: and it has been verified by me that a woman in miscarrying expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	This was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	All this therefore should be in the knowledge of the Midwife.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For perhaps something similar will come to her: therefore let her oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the Extraction of a Dead Fetus:
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the section on medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use operation by hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound strength, and is not with any of the conditions from which destruction is feared for her: then the woman should lie back on a bed, on her back, and her head should be inclined downward, and her legs elevated: and an assistant should hold her on both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with humid oils with marsh mallow mucilage, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the Midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then let her insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her seek with it a place where she may fix hooks into the fetus, and places suitable for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its throat, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is upon its feet, then in the pubic area, and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with the right hand: and place its curve between the fingers of the left hand: and insert it with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches an empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix opposite it another hook, or a third, if you need: so that the traction is equal, and does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be only according to straightness, but rather moved to every side, so that its exit may be easier: as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in what is between that, that the extension be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	But if a part of it is retained, then the Midwife should anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that she may turn with them what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then let the hooks be moved to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore a hand comes out before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its constriction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it until when it comes out completely, cut it either at the joint of the palm, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you do with the other hand, and with the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the head of the fetus is large, or experiences constriction during exit, or there is water collected in its head: then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a spiny spatula, and split the head with it, and extract the water: or break it with the instrument which is called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the remaining instruments in the chapter which follows this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly one should do if the fetus has a naturally large head, then it is necessary to cut the cranium: or extract it with the misdach, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	But if the head emerges, and is constricted at the collarbone: then let it be split, until the fluid which is in the chest is poured out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it does not fold, nor yield to exit: then cut the head piece by piece, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	But if the lower abdomen is swollen, or there is dropsy in it: then it is necessary to pierce it, until fluid runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If truly the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is constricted at the belly, or chest: then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and split the belly, or chest, until what is in them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns: then let the Midwife insert the left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert the hand into the depth of the womb, and seek with it the head, and pull it with the fingers up to the mouth of the womb: then insert in it one hook, or two hooks, and pull it with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot swelling which happens to it: then one should not labor over it, rather it is necessary then to administer pouring of moist, fatty things: and administer plasters: and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it may be straightened: then let be administered what we said regarding the living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	But if that is not possible, then let it be cut piece by piece, and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything from the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said regarding hot swellings which occur in wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	But if bleeding occurs, then let her descend into styptic waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I indeed have seen a woman, in whose belly a fetus was dead: then she became pregnant over it another time, afterward another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore after a long time a swelling occurred in her navel, and it became inflated, until it opened: and began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound was not consolidated.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I therefore placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then some days passed for her, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I therefore wondered at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore examined the wound, and extracted many bones, with the woman being in her better conditions: and she has now lived thus for a long time, and emits a little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I have not confirmed this strange thing here, except because in it there is knowledge, and help for that, which the skilled physician administers with the hand from treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the Forms of Necessary Instruments for Extracting a Fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Constrictor, with which books are flattened, which has two pivots equally placed at the two ends of two wooden pieces.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this Pivot should be more delicate than the constrictor: and it should be made either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each wooden piece should be about two fingers: and the margin of each of both is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two wooden pieces are two extensions of the same kind of wood, which are already firmly fixed in both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two extensions are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that it may be opened with them when you turn the two Pivots.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Form of the Pivot by which the womb is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, more delicate and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made from ebony or boxwood, similar to forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its end there should be two extensions, as you see here above: and the length of each extension is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	Therefore when you want to open the womb with it, then have the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, with what is between her legs opened.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two joined extensions into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, evenly according to the amount you want from the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the Midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Form of another Pivot which the ancients called the Form of the Impeller by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	Form of the Almisdac, with which a large head is crushed: and it resembles forceps, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made elongated, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	Form of the Almisdac with which a small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form of the Hook having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form of the Hook having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Form of forceps which has saw teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	Form of the Spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form of two broad Spatulas also.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are practiced with, and the more their types are multiplied, and are prepared at the craftsman's, the quicker he is at his operation, and the higher among people, due to his quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, rather let it be prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	¶ On the Extraction of the Afterbirth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with white hellebore: and press your hand over her mouth and her nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it comes out by this means, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and make a hole in its lid: and put in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and wormwood, and cinnamon bark, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them in water, and put them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed tube over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end in the mouth of the womb: and hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the afterbirth will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then let her insert it into the vulva, and search with it for the afterbirth.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deep in the womb, then let her insert her hand, according to what we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and extract it gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not prolapse during violent pulling: rather it is necessary that it be moved gently to the right and left sides: then increase the amount of pulling.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it will yield then, and be preserved, and escape from adherence.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with the pot treatment with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	However if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself with repeated extraction attempts.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed it is necessary that whatever protrudes to the mouth of the womb from it, you tie to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then give her an enema with tetrapharmacon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will cause it to rot after some days, and it will dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However when it rots, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and this harms the patient.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore it is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered for this.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Indeed some of the ancients have tried fumigation with watercress and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	Form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated during retention of the afterbirth and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of glass similar to an alembic, or of copper: and let the wide end be placed over fire: and let the fumigation be placed over coals: let her hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat with another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	¶ On the Treatment of an Imperforate Anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born, and their anuses are not perforated, which a thin membrane has already blocked.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore it is necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger: and if not, perforate it with a sharp spatula: and let her beware of the muscle, lest she touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it may become blocked, then place in the opening a lead tube for many days, and let it be removed when the child wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And blockage of the anus also occurs from the healing of a wound, or abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it is necessary that that healed tissue be cut, then treated with what we mentioned regarding treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the Treatment of Fistulas that Occur in the Lower Part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodules and Swellings that occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one of its parts: and it is either one Fistula, or many.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore this Nodule becomes old, it opens, and from it runs a white watery fluid, or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these Fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore penetrating ones are recognized by that which comes out with defecation, and wind, when the patient defecates: and perhaps a worm comes out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And among them are Fistulas which, when they are in this space, penetrate up to the bladder, and up to the urinary passage.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And among them are those penetrating up to the hip joint, and up to the tail bone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	That by which a Fistula penetrating to the anus is known, also from a non-penetrating one, is that you should insert your index finger into the anus: and insert a thin probe into the Fistula made of bronze or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a horse hair, until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	But if you do not feel it at all, nor does anything come out of the opening from defecation, nor wind, nor worm as I said: then know that it is non-penetrating: therefore hasten to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the Fistula is penetrating up to the bladder, or to the urinary passage: then its sign is the exit of urine from it, and its prevention from healing with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If indeed it is penetrating up to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no tortuosity in it up to the bone: and the finding of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always comes out of it: and that treatment does not work on it, nor does it heal with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating Fistulas there is no cure at all: and their treatment is labor and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is imposed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that which is not penetrating, and not old, healing is hoped for with iron: according to what I tell you, and I have already tested: and it is that the patient should lie between your hands on his back: and raise his legs up above his hips, and his hips should be inclined toward his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the Fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however the patient feels it near the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel with your finger that the probe has already penetrated by itself exposed, without feeling between your finger and it membrane or flesh: then therefore know certainly that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor on it, since there is no cure for it, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They have said however, that flesh heals in some men, and from treatment by which help is hoped for it, it is that you should heat a thin cautery according to the width of the Fistula, as preceded, and insert it heated into the Fistula, until it reaches near the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice, or thrice, until you know that all those added filtered flesh parts, which are similar to bird quill tubes, have already been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat that with wicks wrapped in butter, until those flesh parts which were burned come out: then treat that with ointments generating flesh and consolidating.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never heal with another treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe comes out, and does not reach up to your finger, which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh, or membrane: and you see the Fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the Fistula, and you go cutting with the probe what is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches where the probe's tip reaches, and the probe is freed and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh parts, which resemble bird quill tubes, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however the blood overcomes you, and interferes between you and your operation to cut those tissues: then the best thing to do, and of quickest benefit, is to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For cauterization with fire combines good conditions: the burning of those additional tissues, the stopping of blood, and the drying of moistures.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat that with lint rolls soaked in butter, or with ground cabbage, until the site releases pus, and those burned tissues come out in pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments that generate hard flesh: and these are medicines which have astringent and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then it is already healed: and you need not fear recurrence.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the Fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus, and extends from the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel the probe, and between you and it there is a membrane of peritoneum, or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in that case, except according to the way of confidence and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is, because one of three methods is administered in it: either that you cauterize it, as we said: or cut it, until you reach its cavity, so that it becomes possible for you to insert lint rolls, and treatment from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cutting, lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and involuntary defecation occurs in the patient.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat that with what we mentioned.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps indeed it will heal: or you may extend that membrane, and clean it after you cut it up close to the anus, as we said, either with a probe, or with another instrument with a sharp tip.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filtered tissues which are in the incision, as far as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt restoration of the whole wound with the incision, and the upper orifice where it consolidates: and the Fistula remains open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the Fistula is sutured according to this method: that is, when you insert the probe into the Fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus: then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like the needle of aleskef, that is, of leather preparers, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and around them.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the Fistula, until it reaches its cavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it is penetrating in the margin of the anus internally nearby, then extract the thread from that hole: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and extract the end of the thread, and gather the two ends together: and tighten both, and leave that for one day, or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those tissues which are between the two ends of the thread are cut, and fall: then treat the wound, until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the orifice of the Fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not for you to do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Form of the spiny Spatumilis with which the Fistula is split, whose curve is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suturing of Hemorrhoids, from which blood flows after their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Hemorrhoids are of two types.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are inside the anus, similar to coal or ember blisters: or as if they were grape seeds.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of these some are small, and some large: and blood flows from them constantly, and there may be one, or many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its edges.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus mostly have little moisture, from which flows a yellow liquid, or a small amount of blood in continuous flow: and they are the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of those that are inside the anus is that you should instruct the patient to sit down: and to strain until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, either suspend them with hooks: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If however the hooks do not hold them, due to their moisture and softness: then grab them with rough cloth, or with cotton from a woolen doublet, and pull them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle over them after the incision certain hot powders, to serve in place of cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was described in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	But if the anus does not yield to protrusion, then give the patient an enema in which there is a small amount of irritant, so that what is in the anus may be washed, and it may yield quickly to protrusion when the patient strains.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is that you should grab them with your nail, or grab them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have mentioned, until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And for one who abhors cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suturing according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a wound thread, and insert it into a needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the hemorrhoid upward, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and wind the two ends of the thread at the lower part of the needle, and let them be widthwise: and bind the hemorrhoid with a strong binding.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: do not suture it, so that the excess blood may flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or wax salve, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments, and the remaining treatment, until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the Treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often occur from the drying of feces, and constipation of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become chronic, and medicine does not help them: then it is necessary that you scrape with the point of a Spatumilis, or with your nail, until they become moist, and the upper layer which prevents them from healing is removed from them.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them, until they heal as necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If however they do not heal: then repeat them with scraping more vigorous than the first, until they bleed much, and are excoriated then treat them, until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and dry Athelil, and Formica.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round nodule of the same color as the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs all over the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and pain occurs from them when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it is necessary that what is around the nail be cut, and held with forceps, or with a hook, and uprooted from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was explained in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	Of the dry athelil, one is a small protrusion, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur on children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is that you stretch the athelil and cut it: or bind it with a silk thread: or with a hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it as was previously mentioned with fire, or with sharp medicine: and indeed inverted and non-inverted athelil are uprooted with an instrument that I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	Formica is also a small filtered protrusion, thick, on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when cold affects it, it feels like an ant's bite, and it occurs all over the body: and most commonly occurs on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is that you take a small tube from a goose feather, or from a strong vulture feather: and place that tube over the Formica, until the circle of the tube contains its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then rotate your hand with the tube, until you cut what is around the Formica: and place it deep in the flesh, and uproot the Formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with a tube of brass or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the top of the tube be drawn up to a height with a dull spiral, so that its grip and rotation may be easier on the finger.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the Formica as was previously mentioned in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the forms of Instruments which are administered for Clysters in diseases of the Anus, and loosening of the bowels, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes a Clyster is made from silver, or from brass, or from cast or hammered copper.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes small and large ones are made from these Instruments, according to those on whom they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small: and for those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too should their clysters be.
Clistere magnum.	Large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	Small clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is, the upper head in which the bladder is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and it should have a distinction so that the bladder may be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus should be dull, that is, not open, very smooth, drawing to fineness: and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker, and the bladder in which medicines are placed should be from an animal's bladder: or from egg membrane, which should be according to the form of a small asofrati: whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be perforated with many holes as it is rotated, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread of raw thread, which should be of ten threads, or thereabouts, and gather with it the bladder like an asofrati.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	Therefore when the bladder is placed in it, it should be bound at the head of the clyster between two distinguishing points with strong binding.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then administer the clyster.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle of the bladder depicted here, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The proper method of administering an enema with it is: fill a leather bag or bladder with medicine, which should be warmed according to what the patient can tolerate: and take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then let the patient lie back on his back, and raise his legs upward: and place under him an inthaan, that is, a leather mat on which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus gently.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the assistant take the leather bag with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully until all that is in the clyster is emptied into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine compels him to evacuate, then let him hold it as long as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is most beneficial.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If you give him an enema for diseases involving looseness of the bowels, and evacuation happens quickly: then repeat the enema until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or painful swellings, then let the clyster be very thin and gentle, from among the clysters used for children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a thin clyster over which the skin is tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	¶ On the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division on wound treatment what was appropriate for the book, and I will speak here about their treatment by hand and with medicines in full detail.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore I say that wounds differ according to that by which the wounds are made, and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things by which wounds are commonly made are like the throwing of a stone: or cutting with a sword or knife: or striking with a lance, or wood, or arrow: and similar things among many objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that occur according to body locations are like a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver: and similar body parts.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, to establish it as reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: since mention of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	Therefore I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head, and there is no bone fracture: consider then, if it is from throwing a stone, or similar things, and it has only broken the skin: and the wound is large, and you fear the occurrence of hot swelling in the patient: then hurry, and immediately bleed the cephalic vein: and do not delay it: and draw blood from him according to the measure of his strength: if there is nothing preventing bloodletting, especially if the blood coming from the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient guard himself against fullness, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If however something prevents bloodletting, then let him reduce his food, and not approach meats, nor wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place upon the wound if hot swelling occurs, cotton soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine which has astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If however you are safe from hot swelling, then place upon the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I will describe shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place upon it certain ointments, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If however the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and the lips do not come together with compresses, then bring them together with suture, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly about their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If however the wound is already separated from the bone, and is hanging, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension: then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and prescribe to the patient, that he be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads, and cooked wheat until it is like porridge: and similar things to these.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out all the putrefied matter, and remove it: then treat that area.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a Spatumile, or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity demands when what we have mentioned does not help, then cauterize it, until the blood is stopped.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light: such that you should powder over them this powder: since it will heal them before the air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	¶ Method of Making Incarnative Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part frankincense, and two parts dragon's blood, and three parts unslaked lime: grind all of it thoroughly, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with good binding, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it from above with small compresses, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not form an abscess.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from it until it heals.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense at hand, and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many of the large wounds, when it is appropriate to place it upon them and bind them, and they are fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if the air has already altered them somewhat, especially when it is in summer time, then there is no purpose in applying this powder: therefore treat it with what we have mentioned, such that you place upon them certain digestive ointments: or place upon them poultices made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If however a fracture occurs with the wound in the bone, and it is small, then extract it with a Gesti: and I will already speak about the treatment of head fractures in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	¶ Concerning Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If however a wound occurs in the Neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment, and between a head wound when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If however a nerve of the Neck is already cut, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy in it, except that its treatment should be avoided with that which causes severe stypticity, such as verdigris, and vitriol, and similar things to them.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm nerves, and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold at all upon the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most noble of members: and let that with which it is treated from medicines be gentle, like lime washed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, according to this method, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If however the wound is large, then administer suturing: or compress its lips with small compresses.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If indeed the wound has depth, or a cavity occurs in it in its lower part, in which pus has already collected, then perforate it in the lowest place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If indeed an artery is already cut in the wound, and its blood flow has followed: then separate, or cut it, and bind it: or cauterize it, if necessity drives to that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If however the vertebrae of the throat have already been cut, or all, and the spinal cord is saved: then gather the lips of the skin with suturing over the windpipe, and do not touch the throat, rather straighten it, and return it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with appropriate binding, and leave it for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments in which there is stypticity and drying, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If however the wound has made an impression in the bone, then examine it: then if there are bone fragments in it, extract all of them, or what you can of them: and what is not prepared, leave it until the wound putrefies, and separates and its removal becomes easier.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle over it the powder which I described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	However if bone appears in the wound, and it becomes a fistula: then treat it with that which was mentioned in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	¶ On Wounds in the Shoulder Blades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	IF It is a wound from a lance, or knife: and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	Therefore if air exits from the wound when the patient breathes through it, then know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	But if it does not have depth, and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder in it from the first hour, nor bind it, lest blood be retained in its depth, and return to the heart, and kill the patient: but place on it an attractive ointment, and loosen it twice per day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If indeed the ointment is not available to you, then place old cotton in the opening of the wound, so that it may absorb what exits from it of fluids: and have the patient sleep on the wound, so that what accumulates in it may flow out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed three days or more have passed since the wound, and neither spasm nor bad heart tremor nor tightness in breathing has occurred to the patient, and you see his other conditions are good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it both with lint and the remaining treatment, until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If however its healing is prevented, and it keeps opening, then know that it has now become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a sword cut, or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest, or back: then treat it with what was previously mentioned about suturing, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	However if it has made an impression in the bone, and pieces have broken off from it: then examine the wound, and hasten to extract those pieces, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If indeed they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction becomes easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment in treatment of other wounds occurring in other limbs is the judgment of what we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	¶ On Wounds of the Belly, and exit of intestine, and their emergence.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption which occurs to the belly is large, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the large one therefore sometimes the intestine exits, or multiple intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Wherefore their insertion and their suturing becomes more forceful and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And small disruption also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows therefore that their reduction becomes more difficult, if you do not hasten in its insertion to its place immediately: since it swells, opens, and thickens: wherefore its entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Because of this therefore the medium disruption becomes better than disruptions: since with it the reduction of intestine does not become difficult, as it becomes difficult in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the belly is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are suitable in suturing the belly, and in suturing the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly share with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	Nevertheless they are more proper with suturing of the belly: and I will tell you about each one with exposition and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine exits from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: Or because there is swelling in the intestine due to the coldness of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is thus, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or damp cloth in tepid water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or cook squinant and cyprus and spikenard in water, and foment the intestine with it, until the swelling resolves.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does this: and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see that the swelling has already subsided, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through this its entry is eased with a small matter.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however its return is prevented after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than cutting: and there should be no compulsion to cut after necessity and lack of instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it which is twisted be sharp, and its other part not sharp, and let the thin end not be with the thinness of a Spatumilis, but rather somewhat blunter: and that is what resembles a caiada, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is widened and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if this is possible: since it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When truly the rupture is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and his chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then direct your attention and your consideration always to this, that the part in which the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary that you manage this in large wounds and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have present at your hands a dutiful assistant, who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and brings together its edges.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it to the one who follows the suture something after something: and this is the method of common single suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the size of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then leave from the end of the rupture the length of the ring finger, that is, the medical finger: and fix one needle without inserting a thread into it in the two ends of the skin, with the two ends of the sifac which is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already brought together the two ends of the skin and the two ends of the sifac: and they become four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with a double thread around the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two edges of the wound are brought together in a proper joining.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them: afterward secure it with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not therefore cease doing this with what you need from needles, until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: since very thin needles quickly cut the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin: because of that it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in the two ends of the skin very close: so that the flesh is not cut quickly, and the wound opens before its consolidation, and they should not be extended also with suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the ends of the needles, so they do not harm the patient during his sleep: and place on them cushions of cloth from every side, which hold the ends of the needles: and leave them until you know that the wound has already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And indeed this type of suture with needles in such a way is more suitable in small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since one needle suffices in their suture, or two, or thereabouts.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second suture is a common one, where you join together with suturing four edges: two edges of skin, and two edges of the peritoneum at once, with a needle threaded with an even thread in terms of thinness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have passed the needle through these four edges, bring the needle back from the side where you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is like the stitching with which cloths are bound, and place between each suture the width of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This suture is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I sewed up a wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the tear of the wound was larger than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had protruded, and the tear was in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was therefore consolidated in a space of about 15 days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived many years after that, going about his affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was miraculous that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor any medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore placed old cotton on the wound twice a day, and continued washing it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will describe two types of specific sutures according to the narrative account.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with a sharp suture: and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle running along the length and width of the whole body: leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate into the other edge from the inside to the outside at the other edge of the abdominal wall.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in this same edge of the abdominal wall from the outside to the inside: and leave the edge of the peritoneum, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other edge from the inside to the outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration which you make it penetrate in the peritoneal edge of the abdominal wall, which is on its side, until it penetrates it completely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the edge which is from the peritoneum on the other side, and draw out the needle from the skin which it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then return it into that skin, and sew the edge of the peritoneum, which is on the other side, with this edge of the abdominal wall: and draw it out from the skin which is on its side, and do that once, and again: and do that time after time, until you sew the whole exterior according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the summary of this suture is that you sew with the furriers' suture with which they sew skins: so that you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin: and that you leave it another time from the other side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of specific suture, which Galen mentioned.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	His account is narrated thus, that you sew it according to the similarity with which some physicians sew them, such that they gather every part to its matching counterpart by nature: and they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the abdominal wall to its other edge.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you fix the needle in the edge of the abdominal wall near to you from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in it alone: and leave the two edges of the peritoneum.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two edges of the peritoneum, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both, also make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, in the two other edges of the abdominal wall, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this mode of suturing is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture whose remembrance preceded.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also Galen's account.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, insert a single thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle from your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suturing method of those who sew leather evenly.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suturing is more difficult than in other areas of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The treatment protocol for the wound is indeed the protocol for other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, when you encounter a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it: and you return the intestine, and suture it, and adjust it: then apply the powder that promotes flesh growth.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already altered the wound: then apply to it certain ointments which you have at hand, until they cause pus: and the threads fall out, and the sifac and mirach [abdominal layers] heal.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as you would treat other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If you don't have medicines at hand, then immediately after it begins to discharge pus, place old cotton on it: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medication in most conditions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound might affect vital organs with injury, then you should soak soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil: and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	But if he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then give him an enema with astringent, black, tepid wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and an abscess has formed penetrating to its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the large intestine heals more easily: and what is from the small intestine heals with more difficulty.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine which is called Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of the abundance of veins in it, and their size, and because of the thinness of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if what protrudes from the wound is omentum, and you encounter it fresh: return it according to your method of returning intestines evenly.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if time has passed, and it has already become green or black: then you must tie it with a thread above the place that has blackened, so that blood flow does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the omentum there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and leave the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its attraction and extraction may be easier for you when the omentum falls and the wound discharges pus.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	¶ A reminder about wounds that occur in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it may be restored in some people: because I saw someone who was wounded in his belly by a lance strike, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound became old: and turned into a Fistula, and excrement and wind came out of it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I applied treatment, until I was not confident in his healing: nor did I cease to make it finer, until it was healed, and the area was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the area was already consolidated, I feared for the patient, that something bad might happen to the patient in his belly: but nothing bad happened to him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in his better conditions, eating and drinking, and having sexual relations, and entered the bath, and exercised in his daily routines.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experienced practitioners have already said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small: then it should be bound according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is that you should take large-headed ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of these ants which has an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore it grabs onto them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease doing this with ant after ant according to the size of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then return it, and sew the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached to the Intestine until the Intestine is nourished and heals, and no harm whatsoever happens to the patient.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is also possible to bind the Intestine with a fine thread: which has been cleaned from an animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into a needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is that you should take the end of this thread from the intestine, and clean it thoroughly.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then return it into the rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of confidence and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no ingenious solution except making it finer, nor is there any healing for it at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	¶ On the treatment of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound or abscess when it grows old and ancient, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always emits pus, and does not stop: then it is universally called a Fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	A fistula indeed is in truth a hardened, white, filtered nodule: with which there is no pain, which has a cavity like a bird's feather: and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And at certain times it is moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is cut off at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and it is scarce: and it is thick, and it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already explained in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal, nor does flesh grow in it, is only due to one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is either due to scarcity of blood in the body: or due to its poor quality: or because between it and above its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because it has much filth and dirt: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is sent to it is of poor quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment: or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or by a characteristic in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which the digestion of diseases becomes difficult, and the healing of swellings is delayed there by nature: or because in it there is one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For among them are Fistulas which reach to the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or peritoneum: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs: or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the compound joints in composition: like the hand, and foot: and among them are those which go to the proximity of a principal member, and similar things.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore whichever of these Fistulas is according to this manner, is among the diseases difficult to heal, and does not accept treatment, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if there is among the Fistulas one whose depth does not reach to these places which I mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its treatment, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the Fistula extends in a straight line, and examine it with this.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if in the Fistula there is tortuosity, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead with the softness of its body is lightened, and curves around the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	But if the Fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore irrigate from these one orifice from among its orifices.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you irrigate it goes toward the other orifices, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire according to what manner is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is bone there, or nerve, and whether the Fistula's cavity is distant or near: or whether it is one Fistula which has many orifices, and stand upon all that, with the sum of your strength: with your questioning, by which you question the patient, and finding of pain during compression with your hand over the place, and similar things from signs and causes occurring to the swelling.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have stood upon all those things with true standing, then proceed to treatment according to confidence: and it is, that you consider then, if the Fistula is near appearing, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you: then cut the Fistula according to what was set forth from my narrative, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh, which grows in its orifice from flesh, or granulation, and similar things: and treat it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the Fistula is of distant depth, and is according to straightness: then it is necessary that you cut it in depth as much as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then clean it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply bandages soaked in sharp medicines: and insert them up to the cavity of the Fistula which you have grasped with the iron: do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine erodes all corruption that remained in the cavity of the Fistula.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If indeed it does not heal through that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the Fistula is bone, and this is certain to you: then examine it, and cut it according to what I told you: if nothing prohibits you such as a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore the bone is exposed to you, and there is some corruption in it, and blackness: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which causes it to grow flesh, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	But if it does not heal, and discharges pus as it did before: then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore expose it again, and carefully perform its scraping, and cleansing with your ultimate strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If therefore it heals, it is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is in a remote depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore you have no means in it, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	But if the corrupted bone is small, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If however there are many bones, then carefully perform the extraction of all of them, and do not leave any of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If indeed something from the humors opposes you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them: then cut those humors and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed you do not have the preparation for removing the bones at your time, then place upon the wound that which will putrefy it: and leave it until what is around those bones of flesh and humors putrefies.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the incision which you cut in your operation be constricted.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Indeed place upon it, if you fear, cotton soaked in ground sulfur with oil: or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some of the green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humors putrefy, and the bones separate from them, their removal and extraction becomes easier.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If however it is one large bone, like the shin bone, or hip bone, and similar to those, and what is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with ultimate scraping, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If indeed what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you about zuken [a condition], which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may place it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man aged about thirty years, to whom pain occurred in his leg, from a cause that moved upon him within the body, that is, from the interior, until materials came to the leg, and it swelled with a great swelling: and there was no external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Time therefore extended with him with the error of physicians, until the swelling opened, and many materials ran with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was postponed, until the leg became fistulated, and many orifices were made in it: all of which were discharging pus and bodily humors.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was not among them one wise in the art of hand [surgery], until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials that were running from those orifices with great flow: also all the man's body had already wasted away, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore I inserted a probe in one of the places of the orifices, and the probe reached to the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all orifices: and I found them reaching to each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I hurried therefore, and cut above one of those openings, until I exposed part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already eroded, and blackened, and had rotted, and was perforated, until it had penetrated all the way to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Therefore I sawed what was exposed to me, and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I determined that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long period.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it did not heal.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried, and exposed the bone again above the first exposure: and I found the corruption continuous with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore I exposed it again, and did not cease cutting the bone bit by bit, and attempting its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut from the bone about one palm's width, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition in its operation and its cutting was only necessary because of the weak condition of the patient, and his low tolerance, and my fear of his death: since in all hours he was suffering from bad fainting spells due to excessive evacuation.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore he was healed with complete healing: and hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and his bodily condition became good, and his strength returned: and he went about his affairs: and the injury did not cause him any hindrance in walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if a protruding bone in a part of the body is already broken: then it is necessary that you saw it, according to this method: which is: that you take a bandage, and tighten it at the end of the protruding bone: and order someone to extend it upward: and place another bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh that is under the bone: and extend its end, so that you pull the flesh downward: and you expose the flesh over the place which you want to saw, so that the saw does not harm the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood, or a board under the bone below properly: because when you do that, it does not prevent cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be slightly above the corrupted place, so that there is no corruption in the cavity of the bone: and it does not appear visible to the senses, and force another round of sawing.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	But if the bone is corrupted, and not protruding, rather one part continues with another part: and the corruption is in its middle, or in part of it: then expose the flesh completely from all parts.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterward saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues from the other part: and let the sawing be lengthwise a little from the corruption, according to what we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	But if the corruption is in a joint, cut that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no solution for it except scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	But if the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand, or in the metatarsus of the foot: then the matter in it is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Indeed it is necessary that you investigate how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it, and clean it according to whatever condition is possible for you, and with whatever technique is proper for you: when neither Vein nor Nerve opposes you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the cutting tools and Saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their thinness, and their size, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their porosity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every type of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations indicate to you the type of instrument you need, when you have long study with you.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art, testimony of the types of diseases: for then you will find by yourself that which is suitable from the instruments for every infirmity.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you in the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will set as examples upon which you will cut, and the proof by which you will experiment upon others.
Forma Serrae.	Form of the Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of another Saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This depicted form of the Saw should be properly made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arch and its sharpness be made of iron: and its handle of boxwood, and let it be properly made pyramidal.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Form of the Joint Rasp.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this Rasp be according to the form of a starred nail head: and its points should be according to the form of the elischetfegi points.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable, except to rub with it the heads of joints, when they are corrupted, or when the bone is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Form of the larger Rasp.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Form of the medium Rasp.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Form of the wide Rasp.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Form of the Rasp which has a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Form of another subtle Rasp.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Form of another Rasp with curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Form of a small Rasp, of subtle grip.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Form of a Rasp with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Form also of a large Rasp.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a Rod, and the extremity is like a Saw: it is used in many places for the rasping of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Form of a Rasp which is suitable for rasping what has been perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremity is triangular, with sharp ends.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from Indian (steel).
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly it is necessary that all which we have mentioned of Rasps, and Cutting tools, and Saws be made.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	¶ On the cutting of extremities, and Sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities putrefy, either from external cause, or internal.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated that corruption with treatment of medicines, and the treatment does not help: and you see corruption advancing into the limb, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you cut that limb up to where the corruption extends, so that the patient may escape through that from death, or from an evil which is greater than the loss of a limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign to which this happens is that the limb blackens, until it is thought that fire has burned it, or it putrefies after the blackness: until that putrefaction is cut up to that which follows that limb, and creeps into the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Hasten therefore with its cutting, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the strike of certain venomous things: like the sea scorpion, and viper, and rutella, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption or strike is in the extremity of a finger, then cut the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to advance up to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the forearm bone, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold in the bone of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades in it, then cut the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption passes beyond, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer treatment beyond that is a matter of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades in a toe, then cut it at one of the joints: and if it takes in the instep of the foot, then cut the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no device in it, except abandonment, and leaving the patient to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting a limb, or sawing it is that you tighten a ligature below, which you wish to cut: and tighten another ligature above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one minister extend one ligature downwards: and let another minister extend the other ligature upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures, with a broad Spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then let it be cut, or sawed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw does not touch healthy tissue: and that no additional injury and hot inflammation occurs to the patient.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however internal bleeding occurs while you are operating, then cauterize the area quickly: or place upon it certain blood-stopping powders.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same incident that I am telling you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	Which is, that blackness occurred in his foot, with a burning that resembles burning by fire: and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it began to take over the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man hastened on his own, after he saw the corruption spreading in the limb with the intensity of what he experienced from pain and burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, that same corruption occurred in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Therefore he came to me, and I tried to counteract that excess with what I placed on the hand from medicines after purifying his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to spread to another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore he called me to cut off his hand: and I did not want to do that, hoping on my part for the repulsion of that excess: and I also feared death for him during the cutting off of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Since the man's strength was declining.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After therefore he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and word reached me about him, that he hastened and cut off his entire hand: and was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought this narrative, except that it might be an aid concerning what falls under this type of illness: and that it might be a sign by which it is indicated, and according to which one should act.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	¶ Concerning the Treatment of Sinuses, and the Method of Administering Medicines with Clysters.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When inflammation occurs in certain fleshy members, and the duration of the inflammation is prolonged, until it makes a collection of pus: then it bursts, or is perforated, and what is in it of pus comes out, and an empty place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like cloth that has already been thinned: and it has not reached the ultimate in its corruption, nor has it affected bone, nor nerve, nor ligament: it deserves to be named Sinus: and is not named Fistula: however if its duration is prolonged, until the corruption affects any of these members, then it is named Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is that you cut all that skin as it rolls back: and especially when it has been thinned, and made like cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere with the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If however you hope that the skin might adhere, and that ultimate corruption does not follow from it: and if in the skin there is thickness from flesh, then treat it with a Clyster: and it is, that you examine the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor: then treat it with clyster with Egyptian medicine, which is of vinegar, and oil, and verdigris, taking equal parts, collected in a vessel: and they should be cooked over fire, until the medicine becomes red: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and treat the Sinus with clyster: and tighten its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for the duration of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure: do that for so many days, until the Sinus is cleaned, and the foul smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is treated with clyster with ash water, when this medicine is not present for you: and it is, that you take ash of vine wood, or ash from oak wood: and throw water upon it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and treat with clyster with it, until you are confident that the Sinus has already been washed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the water of ashes, then give them an enema with water and honey, to which some ground verdigris has been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or give them an enema with mixed honey and wine, since it is a property of honey to cleanse and wash away: and wine makes the Sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this several times, and you are confident that the corruption of the Sinus has been removed: then give them an enema with that which makes flesh grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is thus: take from the diaphenicon plaster and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or give them an enema with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the Sinus is narrow, such that the cannula of the enema cannot enter: then widen it slightly with an iron instrument: or place in it a tent wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the opening is also wide, then join its lips with sutures: and leave enough space for the enema to enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if its opening from which pus flows is elevated toward the top: then cut it at the lowest point which is in it, so that pus may flow down from it: since when pus is confined in the depth of the Sinus, it prevents flesh from generating in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus around its bottom according to what you want: then try to prepare the limb in such a way that pus flows from it easily according to how it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try not to retain any pus in it at all: and take consolidating medicines which are placed over the mark, suitable for what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such size that it covers the whole Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors directly at the opening of the Sinus a hole, slightly larger than the opening of the Sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread gentle ointments over another cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it at a position far from the opening of the Sinus, so that the exit of pus from it is eased: and do not remove the large cloth except after several days at once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That which is over the opening of the Sinus is that which you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it of pus may exit: and so that you may know whether that which flows from it of discharge is much or little: or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the place of the Sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it or there is no pain in it, and whether there is swelling in it or there is no swelling in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment proceeds in such a way, and you see the matter which exits over the opening of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus has already adhered, or approaches adherence: then therefore loose it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you loose the wound, then change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If however there exits from the Sinus after a long time a thin discharge, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, since among men there are those who are slow in generating flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however there exits from the Sinus after many days undigested pus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adherence of the Sinus is delayed, and its condition is prolonged: then increase in the drying of medicines, but let physicians make it so that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their virtue: like the diaphenicon ointment, when an excess of addition from zinc is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the most ultimate by which it is treated, is that you take diaphenicon ointment, and it is dissolved with rose oil, and ancient wine equal in its substance is sprinkled over it.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then prepare it with this, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it produces a similar effect, when you don't have diaphenicon ointment present, as honey does when you cook it until it thickens, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind it all together, and sprinkle it as powder over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread it on a cloth, and bind it tightly over the Sinus: and spread it with the honey that you cooked until it thickened: and sprinkle the spices over it, and place a cloth over it, and bind it tight.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes long aristolochia is administered in it, and roots of celestial lily, which is iris: and vetch flour, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them either individually or combined, grind them, and sift them: and sprinkle them over the honey which I described, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the condition of the Sinus persists, and is not healed by this treatment: then know that there is corruption in its depths: or it has already made an impression in the bones, or in other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment for Fistulas, according to what was previously described.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of whitlow and bruised nail, and cutting of additional finger, and section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A whitlow is an abscess that grows under the thumbnail of the hand or foot: and perhaps it grows in the remaining fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore its condition is prolonged, and its treatment is neglected, and it swells with hot inflammation: or becomes corrupted, and discharges pus, until it erodes the root of the nail: and perhaps corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you treat it with what we have described in the division, and your treatment does not help: then you must cut away with an iron all the excess that remained from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cautery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and empty additions of the nail are now pressing the flesh inward, and begin to prick it, and harm it: then you must place a thin probe under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upward: and cut that flesh carefully, and place upon what remains of the flesh some burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the corruption has already affected the bone, then you must cut that bone and extract it: for it never heals while corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	But if you see the erosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to what was previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however the nail suffers bruising or a blow: and severe pain occurs in it, then you must first bleed the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula in a transverse cut from above to what is visible.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And take care that the cut does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for by that you will cause severe pain to the patient, and it will be a cause for the growth of additional flesh in the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the area with what relieves pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The additional finger which grows in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or its growth is in some of the finger's knuckles.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore that which grows in some of the finger's knuckles does not move: and that which grows near the finger's joint perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore of these, the one that is fleshy, its cutting is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But treatment of that whose growth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that which grows in the finger near the last knuckle, then you must first cut its flesh with a circular incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The joining together which occurs between fingers often occurs either from a person's birth, that is, they are born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore you must cut that joining until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them lint or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not join together quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin lead plate, until the area heals as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if joining occurs between some fingers and the palm, then cut that joining, according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	¶ On the Incision of Varicose Veins.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Varicose veins are twisted veins, thick, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body: and most commonly they appear in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and laborers, and those who carry loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, you should administer a purging of the body from black bile several times with strong purging.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then perform phlebotomy on the patient's basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment with the iron instrument, however, is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein is raised up and extracted completely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, bathe the leg with very hot water, until the thick, murky blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of his hip down to the lower part of the knee with a band.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then lift up, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and from above it is necessary that you first perform phlebotomy on the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the edge continuously downward until there comes out an amount of blood which you see to be sufficient, and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterward bind it: and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins become full, and this troubles the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The lifting up of it, however, is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the patient's leg, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then place it in a bath: or bathe it on his leg with hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell: or let him exercise with strong exercise, if a bath is not available to him, until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin directly over the vein with a lengthwise incision: either at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein from all sides until it becomes visible to the senses: and upon its appearance, you will see it reddish tending toward black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it emerges from the skin, you will see it white as if it were a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert beneath it a probe, until when it is raised and comes out of the skin: suspend it with a blunt, smooth hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another incision near that incision at three fingers' distance.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it with probes as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need that.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift up and cut it with a final incision near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then draw it out to the incision which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you draw it out from the incision which is higher or highest of all the incisions, until when it comes out completely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If however it does not yield to you for extracting and lifting: then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and bind it, and extract it: or insert a probe under it: and turn your hand to every side until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And take care that it is not cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and harm enters upon the patient from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have extracted it completely: then place upon the site of the wounds wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and treat it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	But if the varicose vein is contracted, having tortuosity which has coiling to the sides, and is not as we said in a straight line: then it is necessary that you split over it at every part of its tortuosity and the places of its coiling.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you lift all of it: and take care in your cutting over it that you do not cut or wound the vein: for it will become difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Form of the Cutting Instrument with which Varicose Veins are Treated.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Form of the Blunt Hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have curvature like the other hooks, nor does it have a sharp end, so that it does not wound the vein: and it has thick bendability, smooth: because if it were thin, it would cut the vein by its thinness: rather it should have excessive thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the Leg Vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein forms in the legs in hot lands, like Alizegi and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands of little tenderness, that is, in which neither herb nor tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it forms in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its generation is from putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as snakes and ascarid worms occur within bodies, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein's appearance is that severe inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the area becomes blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from the site of that blister, as if it were a plant root or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore its end appears, then it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight should be from one drachma keil up to two drachmas, and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Therefore whenever something of it comes out to the exterior, wrap it in the lead, and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	But if it extends greatly, then cut off part of it, and wrap up the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root before it has all emerged.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh: and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be handled gently and extracted gradually until it emerges from its end, and nothing of it remains in the body: and indeed from this vein there emerges in some men what is in length five to ten palms.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has come to my attention that it came out of a man to twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If however it is cut during your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long hole, along with the body, until all the matter that is in it is evacuated: and treat the putrefaction of the area with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And indeed this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the ankle joint or in the foot itself: and many openings occur to it, and from each opening emerges a branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore treat it as we said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	¶ On cutting for Worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Bovine Disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This Disease is named in a certain land among us the Bovine Disease: because it very often occurs in cattle, and it is one small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes throughout the whole body, ascending and descending: and is detected by sensation during its movement from member to member, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and serpents occur, that is, roundworms and ascarids in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And its malice is feared.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it travels in the body and rises to the head and reaches a spot: then perhaps it opens in it and emerges and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to treat it and extract it, then this is not done except during its movement and when it is detectable by sensation.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore it is necessary that you bind what is above it and what is below it with a bandage with strong constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	But if it goes deep into the flesh and you cannot find it: then place a cautery with fire over the spot until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greatest thing that is feared is its corruption by which it corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with good constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines that dissolve putrid bad humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	¶ On the surgery for the illness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain body parts: then it moves from one part to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed I have seen it myself, according to what I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the rope-like vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for one hour, I saw one swelling moving along the forearm, like a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible: so that it was like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain left from that place, and became fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran through the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed therefore at the speed of its movement from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed before that I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way according to this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who experience pain moving from member to member: but I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it to be anything except that it is because the woman was one of those from the villages with a dry body and visible veins: hence therefore that moving windiness appears to the senses.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	Therefore when you want to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is visible to your eye, as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and cut above it until that confined windiness comes out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels windinesses, and disperses them with fetid pills, and pills of sagapenum, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	¶ On the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are differentiated according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they fall.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity indeed is: because among them are those which have large and small points: and hollow ones, and solid ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those which have barbs.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those which have splinters.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those indeed which are according to the members in which they fall, are in two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either they are members from the principal hollow members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	Therefore when it falls in any of these members, and the signs of death appear to you, which I tell you about afterwards, then it is necessary that you avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows that person in whom it is, in most cases.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	Indeed among the signs of the brain when an arrow falls in it, and penetrates the bone, and exits the membrane which is over the brain, is: that from it occurs severe headache, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And from the place of the wound comes out a white moisture similar to porridge.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And from it exits something like watery flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs indeed of an arrow when it falls in the heart, are: that it is near the left breast: and one feels with it as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of the pulse: and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And this is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore, that death descends without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign when an arrow wounds the lung is the exit of foamy blood from the wound: and the vessels that follow the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he exhales great, deep breaths: and seeks to draw in cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the membrane which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is great breathing with severe pain, with sighing: and all parts of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food exits from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the Belly, and is fixed in it: something of excrement exits from the wound, or omentum, or intestine which has already been ruptured.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope in its cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the Bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain becomes stronger upon the patient: then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining members, however, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and upper arm, and vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members can be saved in most cases: when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve: and the arrow is not poisoned.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may understand through it your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is, that to a certain man an arrow fell in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I only found its small end, with which it adheres to its wooden shaft: and it was a large arrow from Turkish bows, with smooth iron, in which there are no barbs.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no bad accident happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one that has barbs.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I therefore cut between two veins: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I therefore worked carefully with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After therefore thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut upon the arrow: and I worked upon it with skill, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no bad accident happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom an arrow fell in his back, and the wound healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After therefore it was seven years later, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman in whose belly an arrow fell, and the wound healed over it, and the arrow remained within her: and none of her conditions changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, in whose face an arrow fell: and the wound healed, and remained, not causing him much pain: and many similar cases to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man among the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already declined slightly to the right side: and the entire arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called to treat him three days after the arrow's fall.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found therefore the arrow wound very narrow.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore searched for it with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and he indeed found a pricking and pain under his ear on the right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that this pricking was from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore plastered the place with a plaster in which was attractive and digestive power, trusting in myself that the place would form an abscess, and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I might cut upon it: and no symptom occurred in the place indicating that the arrow had reached the spot.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I therefore continued with the plaster upon him for many days: and no symptom occurred, and the wound healed meanwhile: and the patient remained concerned about its extraction for a period of days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened: and with a probe I probed it, and felt the thin end of the arrow which was stuck in the bone.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I increased the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the end of the arrow became visible to us: and about four months of time passed with this.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound was widened, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield to exit: then I did not cease to think carefully, and work on it with ingenious methods, until I took hold of it one day with properly made forceps, according to the form that will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose does not restore itself.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was healed with complete health: nor did anything harm him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the method of extraction of certain arrows: so that you may make it a rule and indication for what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended through narrative: nor does a book comprehend it, and the prudent craftsman compares with little against much: and with what is present, against what is absent: and finds new operation, and new instrument for the descent of foreign things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that arrows do not exit from the members in which they are fixed, except according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Either through pulling from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or contrary to the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits where it entered, either is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and it is pulled, and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	But if it does not yield to exit from the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its extraction and its exit become easier.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for some days: and attempt it with pulling and moving every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	But if it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself from all parts with a fine drill, until they are widened for the arrow.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then pull it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already proceeded into one of the ventricles of the brain, and certain of those accidents which I mentioned appear in the patient: then abstain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until its being is equalized after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the membrane, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate up to the membrane: and the patient remains for some days, and none of those accidents happens to him: then be ingenious in pulling the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is very firmly fixed, and does not yield to you for pulling: then employ small drills around the arrow, as I told you: then treat the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the Arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sense: then investigate it with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If however you feel it, then pull it with certain instruments which are suitable for pulling it.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If however you cannot [succeed] with it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in depth: and there is neither bone there, nor nerve, nor vein: then split [the wound] above it, until the wound is widened, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	But if it has ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them from all parts, by every ingenious means by which you can do that, and be ingenious, if you cannot [succeed] in freeing the flesh in the breaking of the ears and twisting them, until it comes free.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of an Arrow, wherever it may be, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps in all directions, until you make it come out: and be extremely subtle, so that the Arrow does not break, and its removal and extraction does not become difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot [extract] it at once, then leave it for several days, until what surrounds it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again: for then it will be easier. But if bleeding causes you trouble, then apply what we described about treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And employ every possible method of Arrow removal that is possible for you: and let it be with ease, and calmness, or slowness, and firmness, as I have described to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, when you pull the Arrow, that the patient be in the same position as when the Arrow struck him.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For this is most helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however this is not possible for you, then employ whatever position is possible.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But an Arrow which exits from the opposite side, or has already proceeded somewhat to the exterior: or the tip of the Arrow makes a bulge that can be felt from above the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: then cut above it, and let the incision be of such size that the forceps can grasp it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it: for it becomes easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If however it is stuck in bone, then twist your hand in a circular motion, until the Arrow makes an impression in the bone, and widens [the space] for itself: then pull it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for several days: then try again, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the wooden shaft of the Arrow is still in it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the wood has fallen off, and you wish to push it: then insert a hollow instrument, so that its cavity enters the Arrow's tail: then push it with this.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the Arrow is hollow, then push it with an instrument that enters into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the Arrow becomes easier [to remove] by this method.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the Arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which there is poison: if this is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is appropriate for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the Arrow has fallen into the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew up the wound, if you think appropriate, and treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the Forceps, with which Arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the tips be like a bird's beak, which are made like irons: when they grasp the Arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many types of these are made, large, and small, and medium, according to the size of the Arrow's magnitude, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its narrowness.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Form of the hollow Pusher.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And form of the solid Pusher.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is with a solid tip like a Rod, so that its entry into the hollow arrow may be easier, and it may be pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The tip of this hollow pusher is hollow like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it and its pushing may be easier.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	¶ On the Bloodletting of Veins.

Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the Ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark there with ink.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take a knife-like lancet, which is called the Cutting one.

Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then release the patient's constraint, and place your finger over the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Afterward, place cotton and small pads over it, and bind it above with strong constraint: and leave it until it heals.

Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	Let the patient constrict his neck with a band until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	Then take the instrument which is called the Fossorium.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.

Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then loosen the patient's perforation, and bind it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a broad lancet.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary that the lancet have a sharp end, like other lancets, rather it should have a broad end.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And perform the bloodletting crosswise: since the bone is near: and perhaps the lancet would break in it when it is thin.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	¶ On bloodletting of the Veins in the two Tear Ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	Moreover, the benefit of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the eyes is for the eye affected by scabies and redness: and sebel in the eye, and diseases of the face.

Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long lancet: and fix it in the middle of its hare-lip, between that which divides the nose according to straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	For the vein does not appear visible there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you steady your hand with the lancet somewhat: and let the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then bind it for one night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	¶ On bloodletting of the Guidegi veins.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	Indeed, the benefit of bloodletting of the two Guidegi is for constriction of breathing, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and corrosive conditions, that is, spreading herpes.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	And the method of their bloodletting is that the patient should bind below both in his neck with a bandage: and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	Then perform bloodletting on the vein lengthwise with a somewhat wide incision.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see from the necessity which exists for it.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then do similarly with the other vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Afterwards loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with moderate tightness: so that the patient is not suffocated.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And leave it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On the bloodletting of the Algeberich veins.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The benefit of bloodletting from the Algeberich veins is: because it helps with thrush in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and cracks in the lips, and bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the method of bloodletting from them is that you make the patient sit before you, and bind their neck with a band.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then turn back their lip, and look for two veins: one of which is on the right of the lip, and the second on the left of it: and both can be identified by their blackness.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And this is true: because around them are minute, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore cut both with an incising cut.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If however there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is: then intend to cut the larger of them, and the more visible one.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed most commonly practice runs with it: and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	On bloodletting of the vein under the tongue after Cephalic bloodletting.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The benefit of bloodletting from the two veins which are under the tongue is: that bloodletting of the Cephalic is for suffocations which are in the throat, and sickness of the uvula, and sicknesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the method of bloodletting from them is that the patient sits between your hands facing the sun: and raise their tongue, and look under the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein: and the color of both tends toward blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore let blood from both: and be careful, lest you take your hand too far in letting blood from them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under them are arteries, and perhaps there will occur a flow of blood from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins which are bled in the elbow are those in whose bloodletting practice has run in all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their bloodletting is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle-leaf lancet: or with an olive-shaped one inclined to fineness: or by cutting with a knife-like lancet, which is the Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is what is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And among them are broad and fine types according to the width of the veins and their narrowness. The form of the myrtle-leaf lancet should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening hollow, full, protruding, visible, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this lancet is of lesser width, and finer at the tip.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for bloodletting of fine veins, which contain thin yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On bloodletting of the Basilic vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The benefit of bloodletting from the Basilic, which is one of these three veins, is:
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from sicknesses which are below the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest and belly: and it is proper for the bloodletter when he lets blood from it, to be careful, and to be fearful of it for under it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs, and adds to the puncture of the lancet, he will cut that artery, and there will occur a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Wherefore it is necessary, not to let blood from it with a puncturing lancet: rather it should be cut with the Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	But if the Basilic does not appear with clear appearance, then it is necessary that you avoid it, and change to another, or seek some branch of it: or let blood instead from the Rope of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is visible, and cut it with the Alnesil lancet, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If however you want bloodletting from it itself, then it is necessary before binding the arm, that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with ink, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a hollow cut with the Alnesil lancet, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful lest the strike fall through space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tighten the binding, swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood at bloodletting leap out like the urine of a boy, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore hurry, and place your finger over it for a long time, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood stops flowing (for it often does stop), then bind the arm and release it: and the patient should avoid moving it, and should be cautious with it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And he should not move it for several days, until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If however the blood does not stop, and overcomes you, and you don't have medicine present at the moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its ends contract, and the blood stops.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of the pistachio tree, and split it: take one half, and bind it over the place of the vein with proper binding, with bandages and small cushions until the next day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood stops, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with what was previously mentioned from the section on powders that stop blood flow: and stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases, because of the small size of the wound, and the possibility of binding from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	¶ Concerning phlebotomy of the Median vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The benefit of phlebotomy of the Median vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body: because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is proper for one performing phlebotomy to be cautious when bleeding it, for under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he goes too deep in the puncture with the lancet and finds the nerve, numbness occurs in it, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it never fully heals.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve is often visible to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If however it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and not visible: then you should make your phlebotomy incision with the Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with all your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	But if the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	¶ Concerning the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The benefit of phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head, and helps with diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary specifically for this vein, if you wish to perform phlebotomy on it, to puncture it with an olive-shaped lancet, or with a myrtle-shaped lancet: since it is the safest of all veins, as there is neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Nevertheless, during phlebotomy, it is proper for you to avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet, and seek a softer spot: and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first strike to repeat the phlebotomy on it several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Nevertheless, it may become swollen in some people when it is not bled on the first strike, but that swelling does not harm it in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	¶ Concerning the utility of Phlebotomy, and precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of Phlebotomy, and its effects, about which rectification you should think.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First therefore of that which you should know, that phlebotomy is not administered except in preservation of health, and its maintenance, and precaution against the arrival of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that phlebotomy should be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Median, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer: and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And phlebotomy should be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours of the day have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But phlebotomy which is administered in diseases has no determined hour: but when convenience and necessity provoke it, at night or day, and at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And children should not be bled until fourteen years have come upon them.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month until the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the elderly be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore when anyone wants to be bled for whatever reason it may be: it is proper that he clean his intestines before phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained waste in them: so that the veins do not draw putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members from the intestines during phlebotomy.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Neither should one suffering from toctina, that is, nauseating satiety be bled: nor one who is drunk, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that condition is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor one sick with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bloodletting should be avoided after colic pain, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual intercourse, labor, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, and anything that dissolves strength from bodily or mental causes.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the thinness of humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prohibits it: or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood becomes thinner.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his bloodletting on the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we said: and strive that his chest be emptied that day of all harmful mental accidents: such as anxiety, anger, and fear: and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, excessive intercourse, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present in his seat things which people customarily use, such as aromatics, fragrances, dancing and similar things according to possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the bloodletter sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one to be bled: afterwards let him extend his arm, and let the bloodletter rub it with his hand two or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tighten the binding with a strap, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the tightness be moderate, since when the tightness is uneven, or excessive in tightness, then it prevents the flow of blood: or in looseness, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the binding, it is necessary that the one to be bled rub his hands together until the veins swell and become visible to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the bloodletter wipe the lancet with a little oil, specifically old oil.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let him place his left hand's index finger on the vein itself slightly below the place where he wants to perform the bloodletting: so that the vein doesn't slip away and the strike miss.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For among veins there is one that you will find like a fleeing string during bloodletting: and among them is one that is full of windiness: and when you place the lancet on it, it contracts under the lancet, and the bloodletter is deceived, and the lancet does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is narrow: therefore for that reason it is necessary that the bloodletter be steady, and be careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then let him lower the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein opens from one attempt, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it another time slightly below that place, or above it with haste: if the place is not swollen.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	But if it swells, or if the patient becomes frightened, then leave him for a day or two days: and do not tighten the binding.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps it will draw a hot swelling.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Neither should he enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	But if the opening is small, or the blood runs thinly: and you fear that the amount of blood you want will not come out: then repeat the lancet in the same hole in a straight line, and increase the operation slightly.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with haste, before the place swells, for a swollen place occurs in many people during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see it already swollen, then do not repeat over it at all, for nothing will excuse you in this.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place on it some of the dregs of oil: for it eases the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer oil dregs in all your bloodletting, with which you let blood from veins when the flow of blood is prevented: and theriac alfarach and sagzenea do that, when one of them is placed on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood becomes thin and dissolves, when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	But if a large swelling occurs in the place of bloodletting, for it often occurs, especially in one who has not been bled except that time, or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and bind it for one hour: for it will be resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do that after the exit of blood from that vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If any blackness or greenness remains in the place after some days, this is not harmful: and if you wish, put on it some aloe, or dissolved myrrh: or some juice of wild mint, that is, calamint or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often swellings and protuberances occur during the bloodletting of the basilic vein.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore place your hand upon it, then if you find softness when you press upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Take care, therefore, not to put anything from what we mentioned on it.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps arterial blood will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with something that has astringent properties, so that the area hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to draw blood from every person according to the measure of their strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And according to what appears from the predominant color of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow until it becomes red: and similarly if you see it is thick: then let it flow until it becomes thin: and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And for one who is full-blooded, strong, and needs blood extraction at once, the vein opening should be made wide, and the lancet should be broad: and for one who is weak, it should be the opposite of this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to draw it out in stages, and the opening should be narrow: and the best procedure in bloodletting is that the cut should be transverse, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from blood flow and from nerve cutting: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting through width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for one who is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary to feed them before bloodletting a little bread soaked in pomegranate water mixed with honey: or oxymel, if they are heated: and draw blood from them in three or four stages.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if they are of cold complexion, then they should take before bloodletting bread soaked in grape syrup, or in honey syrup flavored with spices, or in aromatic fragrant syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and its cause is the exit of much blood: then it is necessary that they drink meat broth and light fragrant syrup: and use aromatics with civet, and their chest should be anointed with it: and use the remaining things which we mentioned in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	For one who wants to open their arm and release their blood a second time: it is necessary for one whose bloodletting is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to release blood gradually according to their strength over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But one who wants to open their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong: then let them do this after seven or nine hours from their first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	And one who wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite of the part to which it inclines: it is necessary that they be opened on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much blood that has become heated, and becomes sharp, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood exit from them at once, and much quantity should be drawn from them: and the opening should be widened until fainting occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting: and that you place your hand on their pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For often this happens when the bloodletter is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And when you want to open the arm and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein has already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, it is not necessary to press upon it with force, and quickly extend what is curved.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very bad, rather leave it until it is bled a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of the lancet that which has coagulated from blood in the opening of the vein, and put on it some salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put on it some of the theriac alfaroch, or sagzenea, and place it with gentle pressure, until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein has become swollen, then leave it, and do not cover it until the swelling subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity calls for drawing blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either perform phlebotomy above that place, or on the other arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	Moreover, the cord of the arm is bled in place of the Fusca and Basilic veins, when they cannot be found and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the method of bleeding it is that the patient should put their hand in warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it should be bound above with a bandage, with moderate tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then perform phlebotomy gradually across the vein, not widthwise, nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your incision with which you perform phlebotomy be slightly above the wrist joint.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the blood flow is blocked, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however you are in the summer days, then you are excused from repeating the hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the flow of blood is mostly placed in warm water in winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the bleeding of this vein is safer than all veins, since there is neither a pulsing vein nor a nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The bleeding of the Salvatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the method of bleeding it is that you bind the palm of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you put it in warm water, until the vein swells and becomes very apparent to the senses.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then bleed it crosswise.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, this will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And take care not to extend your hand too far with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, stripped of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you have drawn the necessary amount of blood, then put oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not heal too quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly you should do this with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The benefit of bleeding it from the left hand is: that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen: and similarly do in bleeding it as you did in the second case equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of bleeding the Saphenous vein is for diseases which are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menstruation, and infirmities of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the method of bleeding it is that the patient should put their foot in warm water: and rub it until the veins become prominent: and bind above the foot joint with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the location of the vein is at the heel, appearing toward the big toe: and many branches spread from it on the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore bleed it in its larger branch, or at the heel where it collects: since this is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	But if you bleed it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And make your incision with which you bleed it crosswise, as if you wish to cut it: and let the lancet be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If however the blood flow is blocked, then return their foot to warm water: and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	But if the phlebotomist misses the vein on the first attempt, then let him repeat with the phlebotomy slightly higher up, for the location is safe, and you need not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the Saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the Sciatic vein, as we said, is at the heel on the sylvan (outer) side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the benefit of bleeding it is for pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the method of bleeding it is that the patient should enter the bath, and hurry: and bind their leg from the side of the hip to above the heel four fingers' width, with a long thin band: for it does not appear except because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then perform bloodletting on it by whatever method is possible for you, either crosswise (which is better), or by making an incision, or by cutting it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	Indeed, its location is safer, and in most people it is very well hidden.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	But if you cannot find it, and it is not at all apparent to the senses, then perform bloodletting on one of its branches, namely the one that appears on the top of the foot and toward the little toe: and beware of the nerves, and let flow the amount of blood that you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the binding, and place leather over the site of bloodletting, and bind the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	¶ On Cupping, and the nature of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cups are made from horns, and from bronze, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And indeed cupping is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and blood extraction: and the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	For either it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And for cups which are administered with scarification and blood extraction there are fourteen places on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the Cupping of Alnocrati, which is the back of the head: and Alkehel, which is the middle of the neck: and the cups of Alhagdahim, which are the two plates of the neck on both sides together: and the cups of the chin, which is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the cups of the two shoulder blades: and the cups of Alachosos above the end of the tail: and the cups of the two forearms, which are the middle of the two arms: and the cups of the two legs: and the cups of the two ankles.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed cupping does not extract blood for you from the tiny veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that strength does not fall from them, as it falls from bloodletting.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should cupping be administered, whether with fire or without fire, in any of the illnesses that occur from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	But if necessity calls for cupping due to illness, or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in its middle, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because among people there is one who, when blood multiplies in him until he needs its extraction through cupping, finds heaviness in his head, and headache.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them is one who finds fullness and redness in his face, his head, and his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them is one who finds itching in his face and his forehead, and darkness and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them is one who scratches the place of his cupping.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or his tongue swells, and he spits blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is one who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	Therefore when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month: we then prescribe cupping to be done, after two or three hours of the day have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit of cupping of the nape is: that it helps with heaviness in the head, and what flows to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But indeed it is necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this cup indeed is in place of bloodletting of the Cephalic vein.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted that one who is of cold complexion use it, or one in whom there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that it is not proper that old people use it, and those in whose head are cold illnesses.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Moreover, whoever becomes assiduous in its use, forgetfulness is generated in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that it is necessary that you instruct the cupper to move his hand with the cup a little downward, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	But cupping of Alkehel is in place of bloodletting of the Fusca and bloodletting of the Basilic vein, and because of that it helps with asthma, and constriction of breathing, and fissure of the breathing apparatus, and cough, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Alkehel Cup be pushed a little, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Cupping of the alhagdahim (scalp) benefits pains occurring in the head, eye inflammation, migraine, perforation, and pain in the roots of teeth: and it serves in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to press his hand during scarification: so that he does not cut an artery, and bleeding occurs.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Cupping under the chin benefits ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases which are in the mouth: and it serves in place of bloodletting of the alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Cupping of the shoulder blades benefits alchafacham (palpitations), which occurs from repletion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Cupping of the inner parts of the two forearms provides the benefit of bloodletting from three veins - the Basilic, the Dark, and the Cephalic: because it draws blood from all those minute veins which are in the flesh: and those minute veins draw from other thicker veins, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to proceed too far in scarification: because the place is devoid of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The cupping which is performed over the alchausos (coccyx) benefits hemorrhoids of the Anus, and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that the cup should be large, and that it should be made of bronze: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps delicate cups might break: and it should be scarified with large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Cupping of the legs diminishes with manifest diminution: because they draw blood from the whole body, and benefit old pains in the kidneys, and wombs, and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and benefit bothor (pustules), and ademenul: and they serve in place of bloodletting of the two saphenous and alhorcobeni veins.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they greatly weaken the body, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of cupping the alhorcobeni (sciatic region) is close to the benefit of cupping the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The method of placing cups is that you first place an empty cup, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the placement of cups, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with equal arrival: and do not cease to repeat and continue this, until you see the place has already reddened and swollen, and the redness of blood appears: then therefore scarify, and repeat with gradual suction.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he among men who is of tender flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, no more: so that the place does not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the cupper to widen the scarification, and deepen it a little: and to moderate the suction in ease, and speed, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first time indeed the way is opened for the thinning of blood, and its wateriness: and in the second indeed for the exquisite investigation of extracting thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If truly the blood is very turbid, then let scarification be done a third time: so that the ultimate is achieved.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or little by little, one scarification suffices for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish to extract much blood, we scarify with multiple scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that it be scarified with deep scarification: and the equal limit in scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What are the oils that should be administered when applying cups, and what should the person being cupped avoid.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	For one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, the areas to be cupped should be anointed with opening, softening, and dissolving oils: if it is in summer time, such as alkanna oil, or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter time, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or sarbatinum oil: and similar ones to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If indeed the excess is thick and cold: then let the oil be marjoram oil, or balsamita oil, or alben oil, or dill oil: and similar ones to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If indeed the person to be cupped has wide pores and tender flesh: then it is necessary that they be kept from oil, and it is necessary that these people wash the cupped areas after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with nightshade water, or with pumpkin water, or with purslane water: and similar ones to these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood has much moisture should wash the cups with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and similar ones to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	One whose excesses are thick should wash their cups with aged wine, or with marjoram water, or a decoction of dill, or chamomile: and similar ones to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And cupping should be avoided in the bath, or immediately after bathing, rather it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And one should not sleep after cupping.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it by which the person to be cupped or bled should be governed before cupping.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	AND after it, you should first consider: then if the person cupped or bled is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation dominate their blood: then they should take cooling things, like sweet pomegranate: and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and sekanjabin, and julep: and similar ones to these.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And make their foods chicken, and sekebiget sheep meats, and foods seasoned with verjuice: and similar ones to these.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And one whose complexion is cold should drink honey syrup, or almiua, or sekanjabin made from seeds: and should take fragrant wine of medium age, which is between old and new: and should be instructed to eat sparingly.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And make their food chicken, and canebir: and sparrows, that is, small birds: and young pigeons prepared issiadebet.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And the drink on the day of cupping and bleeding should be more than the food: and it is necessary that some people be given to drink at times theriac alfaroch, or musk medicine, that is, muscata, or alesselithe before cupping: and before or after bleeding: so that the principal members are strengthened and the blood is made thinner.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And they should not drink it when heated.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Concerning Cups without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Cups which are without scarification are cups which are placed over the liver, and spleen, and gout, and over the belly, navel, and areas of the kidneys, and hip socket: since these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And nothing is sought through them, except either the drawing of blood from one member to another: just as we place a cup over the breasts in illness of nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to release cold windiness stuck in a member: just as we place a cup over the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes pain because it dissolves that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys, when obstruction or stone occurs in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	Indeed by its power of attraction it perhaps opens the obstruction, or uproots the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when placed over the liver and spleen for grinding down windiness in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these cups are administered empty with cutting only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of tepid water in illnesses of pleurisy: and that is, that the cup should be filled, and should be large, with hot water alone, or water in which suitable herbs have been cooked.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Shape of a Cupping Glass administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two spread fingers, according to what we have shaped: and let its depth measure half a palm: and let there be on its side, around its middle, a small hole, of such size that a needle may enter it: let it be made entirely of brass, or yellow copper, with thick, smooth, even, polished edges: so that it does not harm the limb when placed upon it: and let there be in its middle a crossbar of brass, or iron, where a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this cupping glass is made large, larger than the one we described, and a little smaller than that one, according to the illnesses and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	Indeed, the cupping glasses for children and thin people are different from the cupping glasses for men and people of thick bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The method of placing this cupping glass with fire on a limb is that you light a wick with fire made properly from linen, or a small wax candle: and place it upon the middle of the crossbar which is in the middle of the cupping glass: so that the lit fire is around the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the patient's body is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then let it be placed on the limb: and let a finger be on the hole which I mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glass: when we need to, we remove the finger, and vapor will escape through that hole, and the cupping glass will be released immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the wick in its usual way, and repeat it, if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in the cupping glass which is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no crossbar, nor hole: and it is administered only because it is filled with water, and placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this cupping glass is better the larger it is, so that it may hold much water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	On the Application of Leeches.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leeches are not administered in most cases, except on those limbs where the placement of cupping glasses is not possible, due to their smallness, such as the lip, and gum, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a limb stripped of flesh, such as a finger, and nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the method of using them is: that you obtain leeches which are from sweet waters, clean from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then let them be left for a day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then evacuate the body first with bloodletting, and with cupping glasses.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then clean the patient's limb, until it reddens.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards let them be placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they are filled, and fall off, and it is possible to suction the area with a cupping glass, then this is most ultimate in benefit: and if not, then wash the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and let it be rubbed, and squeezed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	But if the flow of blood continues after the falling of the leeches, and it is oozing: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the oozing is stopped.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then sprinkle ground vitriol upon it, or gallnuts, and similar astringents: until the blood is stopped.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or let halves of peeled beans be placed upon the area: and let them be left until the beans adhere to the area, for the blood will be stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if the repetition of leeches is needed, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If however the leeches are prevented from attaching, then clean the area with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or pierce the areas with a needle, until some blood comes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then let them be placed, for when they sense some blood, they attach immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you want them to fall off, sprinkle some ground aloe upon them, or salt, or ash: and they will fall off immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	¶ Book III of Surgery by Albucasis.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	¶ General discourse on restoration, dislocation, treatment of twisting, and similar matters.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This Chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, that the foolish among physicians and common people boast about this Chapter, those who have never examined a book of the ancients, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it happens that this branch of knowledge in our land is lacking.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never encountered anyone good at it at all, and I did not attain what I have attained in it except through lengthy reading of ancient books and studying their meaning, until I extracted this knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I devoted myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have already described to you in this Chapter everything that my knowledge contains: and what my experience has covered, after I abbreviated it for you, and freed it from lengthy digressions, and abbreviated it to its final form, and showed it without deviation: and I have drawn in it many illustrations of instruments which are used in it, with some additional variations, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	¶ Summaries and collections about the nature of bone fractures, among those things whose introduction is necessary before we begin the discussion of fractured and various members, each individually.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we state in the prologue of this Chapter the main points of discussion and chapters, whose understanding is first required for the practitioner to stand upon their truth: namely so that you, and those who are ready, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	Therefore, I say that when someone suffers a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or a fall: then it is necessary that you hurry first to bleed him, and purge him, or both together: if nothing prohibits it, such as weakness of constitution: or if the one to whom something of these happened is a child, or a very old man: or if it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content in his diet with cold vegetables, and the meat of birds, and young goats: and forbid wine, and heavy meats, and being filled with foods and any food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are secure from hot swelling, and do not fear the flowing of matter to the limb: then let the patient return to his first regimen with which his custom proceeded.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore the broken bone begins to heal, then it is necessary that the patient be fed foods that nourish with much, thick, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow stomachs, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar things to these.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen indeed, the healing of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in early old age, and the decrepit, it is not possible that they join and consolidate according to their nature always, because of the dryness of their members: and those of them that are extremely soft consolidate and join, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Nevertheless, nature attaches over the broken bone from all sides something like glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds it, until they are glued together, and bound together, until it comes to complete strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its functions: and for this reason it is necessary that you make the patient's nourishment foods in which there is heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that there are different types of fractures, according to the diversity of limbs: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the spine bone; and similarly all other limbs are different from each other: and I have come with the remembrance of every type of fracture explained in its own Chapter, distinct from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of bone fractures also differ in themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For there occurs an arched fracture, without splinters occurring in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and there are splintered fractures, that is, with splinters, and protruding additions, like those in a reed when it is prepared with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And non-protruding ones: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and there is a fracture that is a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And for every type there is a technique, or proper instrument for its restoration, according to what will come in its remembrance, distinguished in their places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And among the ways by which a bone fracture is recognized, is its crookedness, and its prominence: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	Therefore when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor sound upon your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the patient find great pain: then there is no fracture there, rather it is possible that there might be a twist, or a small fissure: therefore you should not move it with hand and compression at all, but rather place upon it from the medicines, whose remembrance comes, after that moment which suits the place: then let it be bound with a subtle binding.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place is bent, and split in two, without splinters occurring in it, but rather each part is removed from its companion: then you must begin at your hour to rectify it, straightening it before a hot swelling occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for some days, until the swelling subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then straighten it according to whatever method is possible with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration, and its straightening, is easier than that of a bone in which splinters occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what will come to you in its remembrance.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if there are splinters in the bone, then extension of this fractured limb from both parts is necessary, if it is a hand, or foot: or with your hand, if the limb is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position in which you place the limb be on an even place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then strive to make those additions return by every skill, and according to whatever method you can to their places: and take care according to your strength, lest pain or injury occur to the patient through your operation: and strive according to your strength, to join one of the two bones with its companion, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary in that hour, that you test and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see anything irregular there, rectify it, and straighten it according to the measure of your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent extension, and strong compression, as many of the foolish do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times they cause through that operation of theirs a hot swelling, or contraction in the limb: as we have already seen that from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then attach after the straightening, and decent operation, and binding of that limb, and rest, and tranquility: and advise the patient about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware, lest he move it in the hour of his waking, and his sleep during his turning, and his movement, and during his evacuation, and all his movements to the utmost of his ability.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he should beware, lest the position of the limb be a position with which pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Which is, because when he feels pain or injury in the condition of the limb's position: then it is necessary that you change it to another condition from that with which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And beware with that, that its position be even, straight: so that no crookedness occurs in the limb, when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the method of binding a broken limb is as I will describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness and their size, and in their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Those among them that are small, like the arm, finger, and forearm bone, and similar ones, then it is necessary that the wrapping be of soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But those among them that are thick, like the thigh and leg, it is necessary that they have a wide, firm wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Since a wide bandage connects a large limb and binds it from all sides with even pressure, so that no mark enters it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after your cleaning by evening out and placing a suitable dressing for that purpose, with soft tow over the fracture site itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the fracture site with three or four turns, according to what the limb requires: and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the upper part from the fracture site, and tighten less than was your tightening with which you bound the broken site.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then distance yourself with the wrapping from the fracture site a little, and loosen the binding gradually, until you take up a large portion of healthy area.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another band, and wrap it again over the broken site with turns.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterward go with the wrapping to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your procedure in tightening the wrapping, and loosening it, be according to what we said in the first upper wrapping.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the wrappings some soft tow, or cloth, with which to even out any crookedness of the fracture, if there is crookedness in it: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap over it another band.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterward align over these wrappings splints properly made immediately, if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the area.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling or inflammation in it: then place over it what calms that inflammation and removes the swelling: and leave it for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten the splints over it at that time.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the splints be made from halves of wide cane, scraped, wisely shaped: or let them be from wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the splint which is placed over the break itself be somewhat thicker and wider than the other splints: and let the length of the splint be according to what is appropriate for the limb in terms of size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tighten over the splints with another band, according to that same first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind over it with threads properly, according to what we said about binding: that is, that your binding should be tighter over the fracture site: and the further it extends from the fracture, let the binding be looser.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and thinness, and be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the work of fools who put their threads from twisted linen cords, it is a great error: since the binding with them falls outside proper measure.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads again are not suitable: since you will not achieve through binding with them what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And there should not be less than a finger's width between splint and splint.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	But if the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints after binding in healthy areas: then place under them some soft tow, or carded wool, until nothing is harmed from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however the fracture is with a wound, and disruption occurs in the skin, I will come with mention of it in a chapter according to its particularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb should be bound with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Which is because when a limb is large, you should not place splints over it except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your confidence about the occurrence of hot inflammation.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, with which the ancients restored [bones], which are placed over fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	Method of a common abbreviated plaster, restoring fractures, suitable for many constitutions, especially women and children: since it is one in which neither heat nor cold predominates.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you should take dust from the mill, which is the flour meal that hangs on the mill walls near the movement of the millstone: and prepare it as is, except that you should sieve it with egg white: and make the preparation neither thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Method of another plaster, restoring fracture, dislocation, and sprain.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almess, laudanum, acacia, elecampane, and mugwort: and suc, 10 drams each of all; of myrrh and aloe 5 drams each; and 20 drams of alethil; let all be ground and sieved, and mixed with alethil water: or with egg white, if the patient's constitution is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and helps many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Method of another plaster, which also helps fracture and sprain.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugwort, and mess, and white marsh mallow, 10 drams each of all; of myrrh and aloe 5 drams each; 6 drams of acacia; 20 drams of Armenian clay; let all be ground with much grinding, and sieved, and prepared with water, or egg white: and administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Method of a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places: and it calms the pain occurring in them, and bone splitting, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Let unwashed wool be taken, and submerged in vinegar and cooked oil: and placed on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster indeed there is no restorative power, but it is good in calming hot swelling: and especially drives away pains.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Method of a plaster which restores broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of deaf fig, and leaves of wild poppy: and grind all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Method of an abbreviated plaster, administered for the restoration of bone fracture: and when you want resolution of residual swelling.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take of marshmallow root, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and vetch flour, one part each of all: let all be ground, and prepared with wine, if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	But if it is heated, then prepare it with water of fresh coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Method of another plaster stronger in resolution than this first one, when hard swelling occurs during limb restoration.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take of marshmallow root, and linseed, and pomegranate flower, and melilot, and marjoram, and violet flower, and chamomile, one part each of all, let all be ground, and prepared with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All that according to the heat of the limb, and the quieting of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a broken limb during its restoration, except a wax plaster made from wax and oil: nothing else: and he related that it should be medium between thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But it seemed to Galen that things should be placed on a broken limb during its restoration in which there is drying of heat, such as myrrh, and aloe and frankincense, and similar things to them from those which we have related.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of a plaster which helps injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take equal parts of mugwort, and chickpea, and cut human hair, or bird feather, and marsh mallow, and salt: let them be ground, and sieved, and prepared: and let a plaster be made from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The duration for which it is proper that the bandage should remain, before it is loosened, is that you should consider then, if no pain occurs to the patient, nor itching, nor does the broken bone move from its place: then do not loosen it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If there occurs in the place intense itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling: then hurry, and loosen it immediately, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or soft, moist sea sponge: and submerge it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching subsides and the pain is relieved.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it unwashed wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it over it for one night, until you are safe from hot swelling, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat it with a gentle binding, and a small plaster: and do not bind it as tightly as your first binding, and proceed gently with it until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	But if you see that the swelling, and redness, and pain, and inflammation, and all symptoms have now completely subsided, and you need a plaster and binding, then repeat it just as you did at first, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	But if none of those things we mentioned happens to the limb, then do not loosen it except after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And sometimes all of this is left for twenty days, according to what appears to you regarding the loosening of the limb, as we said, until when the fracture adheres and the flesh begins to coagulate over it: even then increase the binding more than your first entire binding: and also increase the thickness of the patient's food, according to what was previously mentioned.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	However, if you see the fracture site becoming dry and thinner than it should be: then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore moisten it with lukewarm water whenever you loosen it, and let this be every three days, and slightly loosen the binding.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this procedure, therefore, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which foolish bone-setters do with a fractured limb a second time, when it is not set properly at first, and heals crookedly, is an error in their procedure, and a great danger: and if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and would have practiced it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen any trace of them doing this at all, and it is more correct that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	¶ Concerning fracture occurring in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The types of fracture are diverse, and its forms many: and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For among fractures there is that which occurs from a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the entire bone until it reaches the membrane which is under the bone, just as an ax does in wood: and because of that this type of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts part of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the cut does not penetrate to its depths: and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Elevation absolutely.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And among fractures there is that which is crushing or grinding: and its cause is being struck with a stone, or falling onto a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which has already approached the membrane that is under the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And among fractures there is that which is hidden in the bone with the fineness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And among them is a fracture which occurs from a fall, or strike of a stone, and similar things, which cause the layer of bone to go inward, and a hollow forms in the place: just as happens to brass cauldrons when they receive a blow, and part of them goes inward.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed this happens most often in the heads with moist bones, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And separate treatments are made for all these types of fractures, and I will come with the mention of all of that in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures through exposing them, and examining them with probes, and removing corrupt flesh that is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillary-type (fracture) is recognized by this: that it is exposed on the bone, and when it is cleaned and painted over with ink, the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In treating a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms something that clearly indicates danger, such as bilious vomiting, tenseness, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, protruding eyes, their redness, and similar symptoms in most cases, it certainly cannot be cured: but if you see symptoms that do not frighten you, and you hope for recovery: then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if an injured person comes to you immediately after being wounded: and if it is in winter days, then you must endeavor to remove the bone before the fourteenth day under all circumstances.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in summer days, then you must hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from the membrane becomes corrupted, and those symptoms we described occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the bone fracture has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with fragments and contusion: then you must cut away the comminuted and crushed part, according to what I will tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is that you should shave the wounded person's head: and expose the bone in whatever way possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is manageable for the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If during the exposure of the bone there occurs bleeding or hot swelling: then treat it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	That is, fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and let the wound rest until the swelling subsides, and you are safe from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is that you cut the bone with a narrow-edged Incisor: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then use another Incisor after the first one, slightly wider than it: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also use another Incisor even wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you should have a number of different Incisors: some wider than others, and some shorter than others: and they should be extremely sharp at their ends, and be made of Indian iron or steel: and use gentleness in striking the Incisor, so as not to shake the head and harm it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If however the bone is strong and hard: then you must drill around its circumference, before you use the Incisors, with drills called non-penetrating Trephines: and they are called thus only because they do not pass beyond the limit of the bony skull to what is behind it: because the Trephine has a round extremity above its sharp head, similar to a margin, and the small circle prevents it from sinking in and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is appropriate for you to take many of these Trephines, each one suitable for the thickness of the bone, until you have for every skull a Trephine: whose sharp extremity's quantity in length and shortness is according to the quantity of that skull's thickness.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three types of Trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The method of drilling around the fractured bone is: that you place the Trephine on the bone, and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the Trephine to another location, and place what is between each hole the width of a needle, or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the Incisors what is between each hole from the bone: and make it as thin as you can manage with utmost gentleness, as we said, until you extract the bone, either with your hand or with some other of the instruments which you prepared for that: such as forceps and fine scissors.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And you must take every precaution not to touch the dura mater with either the Trephine or the Incisor.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have gone around drilling the bone, and it has been separated from the membrane, if it was continuous with it, and you have extracted it, you should scrape and smooth the edge of what remains in the bone with another similar cutting instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thinner and more delicate than other cutting instruments.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	And if any small bone fragments and splinters remain, then remove them carefully with whatever instruments you have at hand.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound afterward with lint and the ointments we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And there is another method of operation that is easy and completely free from fear, which Galen described and praised greatly: and these are his words.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	First, you must begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and most visible: until when you have exposed that part, and placed under it the tip of this lenticular cutting instrument, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything: and its sharp part on its two sides runs lengthwise, as you see: so that the lenticular part rests against the membrane, with its sharp cutting face against the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the cutting instrument from one side with a small mallet, until you cut through the entire bone easily, as it turns: and be assured regarding the membrane, that no concerning accident will happen to it at all.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not the most foolish and ignorant of men, and were not asleep, then if anything of the membrane remained attached to the bone in certain places, he would cut it away from it with the tip of the same lenticular instrument, and free it from it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the bone fracture does not penetrate to the membrane, and what is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughness and fine splinters remain in it: then you should scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that you can use from among them in any location the most suitable and most appropriate ones, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And in your scraping, when you first scrape the bone, you should use the widest of those rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then after that use one finer than it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this continuously until you proceed to using the thinnest and finest of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small capillary fissures and fine fractures, you should administer treatment according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And this is something that is not hidden from anyone who has any study in this art and has understood what we have written and shown regarding major fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If however the exposed membrane is retained when you remove the bone: then you should take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth folded double or triple, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do this as gently as you can over it, so that the membrane is not weighed down.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a wide bandage over it: and do not tighten it except by an amount that just holds the wound: and leave it with this treatment for one day or two days, until you are assured against hot inflammation.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it, and afterward apply medicines which have excessive dryness: such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and frankincense powder, and birthwort, and similar things: and it is that you should make from these medicines a powder, which is to be sprinkled over the wound as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And generally apply to it any medicine whose property is to cleanse, and not to irritate.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clean: and let there be in it neither ointment residue, nor filth.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not let pus accumulate in it at all: since when pus accumulates on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it, and putrefies it, and afterward great harm befalls the patient: and it has already occurred in the membrane of the head, when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, that blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider then, if the symptoms we mentioned occur in the patient, know that it is undoubtedly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the blackness occurs only from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness: then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and spread them on a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the membrane: afterward treat it with the types of treatment that are suitable, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	¶ On the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that only the two upper parts of the Nose break together, or one of them: because they are two bones: since its lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break, and nothing happens to it except bruising, and twisting, and flattening.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts breaks, then it is necessary that you insert the little finger into the nostril, and straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the Nose returns to its natural shape: and let that be done skillfully, with gentleness.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And take care that pain does not occur to the patient through that operation of yours.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	But if the fracture is in the upper part of the Nose, and the finger cannot reach it: then it is necessary that it be straightened with the end of a probe, in which there should be a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed the fracture is in both parts, then do similarly to that: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling has subsided.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a plug of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two plugs if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be in the plug sufficient thickness to fill the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient healers said to soak the plugs in butter, and change them every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That indeed does not seem right to me, rather it is necessary that the plug be soaked in egg white, mixed with mill dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the plug until the bone becomes firm and the cartilage hardens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose quill is inserted into the Nose instead of the plug, after it is wrapped with soft cloth: and it happens that it holds the fracture of the Nose more firmly, and so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that: and if you wish, make plugs.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	But if while you are working a hot swelling happens to the Nose, plaster the nose with wax ointment, or with cotton soaked in rose oil, or a little diachylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If however no hot swelling occurs, then it is necessary that you plaster it with sesame flour and powdered frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place soft tow upon it, and do not bind the Nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If indeed the bones of the Nose break with a small fracture, or are shattered, then it is necessary that you cut over them, and extract them with instruments that are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew up the incision, and treat it with what causes flesh to grow and consolidates from suitable plasters or ointments for that.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	But if a wound occurs between the Nose, then it is necessary that you treat it with plugs: and use a lead tube, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: observe then if the fracture is only external, and is not broken in two, and curves inward: then its diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth: similarly if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the protrusion of the fracture from inside gently outward with your other hand from the inner part of the bone properly, and with it align it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw is already separated in two, then you must apply traction from both parts, according to straightness: until its alignment becomes possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If moreover there has already occurred loosening or disruption in the teeth: then bind those which you hope will remain with gold wire, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a wax plaster over the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a folded cloth, and place over the cloth a large splint properly made: or an even piece of sole leather, along the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above, according to how its bandaging is prepared for you, and its application is suitable, until it does not come apart: and instruct the patient to maintain tranquility and rest: and make his food soft liquid meals.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however you think that some part of its shape has already changed in some way: then hurry, and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then rectify what has been altered from it, and plaster it with mill dust mixed with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the wax plaster: and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While therefore that plaster remains attached over it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not loosen it, until it heals: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	Indeed this fracture often heals in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	But if meanwhile a hot swelling occurs, then administer what we have mentioned many times for its sedation, until that swelling is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, examine it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if a fragment has already separated from the bone, or from splintered pieces: then be subtle in this, that you remove those splintered pieces with whatever instruments are suitable for their removal.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the opening of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a lancet according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those splinters, and none of them remain, suture the opening of the wound, if it is wide: and if not, place upon it plasters which are suitable for that, and help it heal, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	¶ On the restoration of the Collarbone, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The collarbone is most often broken at the anterior part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Either it breaks and separates in two, without any splinters occurring in it: and this is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or such that splinters occur in the bone: and this is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or such that the fracture comes with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the procedure for it when the fracture is without a wound is that you should have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the arm that follows the broken collarbone, and the other extends the neck to the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then align the fracture with your fingers, until its form becomes as it should be: and there should be neither protrusion nor cavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a ball of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your need: and extend and elevate the collarbone, and compress the ball with your hand until you align the fracture as needed.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the end of the collarbone outward because it has gone deep, then the patient should lie back on their neck: and place under their shoulder a medium-sized pillow, and have the assistant press their shoulder downward until the collarbone bone that is deep rises upward: and then straighten the fracture and align it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel splintered pieces from the collarbone, and it moves: then you should cut into it and extract the splinters carefully.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is stuck in the bone, then devise to cut it with one of the cutting tools that you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the collarbone an instrument that protects the membrane: and it is an instrument of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon that has no cavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to what you need of it based on the size of the bone, whether large or small.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length also according to what is possible for you to operate with.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the disruption of the wound that you cut when you extracted the bone splinters is wide, and you are safe from hot inflammation: then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or you fear hot inflammation: then fill the wound with cloths and small pads according to the size of the wound's cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If hot inflammation occurs, then soak the cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it over it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The binding of the bone when it is without wound and without cutting is that you should place over the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place soft tow over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a ball under their armpit, if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a himemah, that is, a bandage that the Saracens use, which should be very long: and its width should be one palm or thereabouts.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled pad over the tow and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width should be three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the splint in the place of the bandage that falls over the fracture and area.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the bandage over the fracture as it is wrapped, and wrap it over their neck, and under their healthy armpit, and under their injured armpit: and return it over every part, and however you see that the binding holds the fracture with proper tightness: and all this is not hidden from you, and everything, so that the splint does not move from over the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And because of this you should examine the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	When therefore the bandage becomes loose, and you see the splint has moved: then straighten it, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put the patient to sleep on his back, and place under his armpit during his sleep a small pillow at night, so that with it his upper arm is elevated from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore the fracture of the collarbone is elevated by raising the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Either tie his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage, unless there occurs in the area a symptom from itching, or from swelling, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see its surface requires it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And increase the tightness, and leave it until it heals and solidifies.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed the fracture of the collarbone becomes tight and strong typically in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some people in less than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	¶ On the Treatment of Fracture of the Shoulder Blade.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The shoulder blade rarely breaks, and [when it does] in its wide part: and nothing breaks from it except its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore a place breaks from it, and it breaks in its middle, and this is not known except by touch: then according to the nature of the fracture, attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And return it to its natural shape by every method of technique that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place on the area mill powder with egg white, and soft tow, and place above it a pad of folded cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place over it a wide splint from a thin board according to the size of the entire shoulder blade, or slightly larger than it.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed under the splint there is a hollow in any areas of the shoulder blade, then level that hollow with soft tow, until the splint descends evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then tighten over it with a long bandage, with decent constriction, and firmness of the splint, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And check the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever therefore the bandage becomes loose, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it moves from its place: and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And indeed the shoulder blade heals in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the bandage: and you may be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is one of the bones whose joining is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a fragment protrudes from the bone, and pricks under the skin: then cut over it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the collarbone regarding the treatment of hot swelling, if anything of that sort occurs.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	¶ On the repair of a fractured Chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in its middle, and this rarely occurs.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities indeed most often break and are crushed from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle breaks, which slopes downward, and severe pain occurs, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps he vomits blood, and a hollow appears in the broken bone, and is not hidden to the senses, its Repair is that the patient should lie back upon his back: and place a pillow between his Shoulder blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and bring together the ribs from both parts or sides with the hands: and be careful in aligning it, according to every way in which this is possible and appropriate, until the shape of the bone returns to what it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place upon it a plaster and tow, and place above it a splint from a thin board of willow, or teak, and from similar things in lightness, after you wrap it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then be careful in binding it over the broken bone, so that it does not move: and go with the bandage according to the roundness to the back several times, and tighten it with decent tightness.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then check the bandage every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if necessity compels its loosening due to itching, or irritation which occurs in the place, or pain, or swelling: then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has occurred with the method of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then replace the plaster, if you see fit for that: and attach the tightening to it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	¶ On the repair of Ribs, when they break.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that Rib fracture does not occur, except in the thick places which follow the spine, and from their extremities in the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And crushing does not occur to them, except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And knowledge of it is not hidden from the senses during examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its repair is done thus, that you align the fracture with the fingers according to the possible way, until the shape is aligned, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and tighten the broken bone with a splint, if it needs that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the Ribs is sloping towards the interior: then severe pain occurs to the patient, and stabbing, like that stabbing which occurs to one who has pleurisy: because the bone punctures the membrane, and also difficulty of breathing occurs to him, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And indeed the ancients have contrived in it with many devices: and among them are those who say that you should give the patient foods which generate inflammation and windiness, so that the belly inflames and extends, and pushes the fracture to the exterior.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We however abhor that a quick cause should not be made for making a hot swelling, if it has not occurred.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already occurred, then it increases in it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a cupping glass be placed over the place, then let it be sucked with force, and it is more similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However it is feared that the cupping glass might draw superfluities to the place, because of the disposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil: and let cushions be placed between the Ribs, until it is filled: so that the binding might be equal when you wrap it according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then let the patient be treated with the treatment of pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	But if a severe matter constrains the patient, which he does not tolerate, and the bone punctures the membrane with a harmful puncture, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary that we cut over the place, and uncover from the broken Rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place over it the instrument which preserves the peritoneum, whose mention preceded: and let us cut the bone with ease, and let us cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture: and let us treat it with plasters, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	But if meanwhile a hot swelling occurs, then hurry, and pour cushions in rose oil, and place over the place: and let the patient be treated with what suits the swelling.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile also let him lie back on the side on which he sleeps, until he heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	¶ On the repair of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, fracture sometimes occurs to the bones of the neck, and rarely does crushing happen to them: and similarly also to the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	Therefore when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not heal: then observe.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see their hands already softened, and numbed, and dead: and they cannot move them, nor extend them, nor grip them: and when you squeeze them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, they do not feel it, and do not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in most cases it is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if they move them, and feel in them the squeezing with fingers and the pricking: then know that the marrow of the bone is safe, and that the patient will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if something similar happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will also heal or not: then look at their feet: then if you see that they are softened, and there occurs in them what occurs in the hands: then when they lie on their back, wind and excrement come out without control: and when they lie face down on their belly, excrement comes out without control: and when they lie on their back, and want to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not labor in treating it.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if none of that happens to them, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of what happens from that is that you should attempt to calm the hot swelling: thus, that you place upon the crushed vertebra rose oil alone: or with the yolks of roasted egg.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place this upon it several times in the day, until when the hot swelling subsides: then place upon the location one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage: and instruct the patient to maintain rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And not to sleep on the part with which they find pain, until it heals.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	But if there occurs with the crushing of the bone splintering, or something that has become separated from it: then it is necessary that you cut into the skin, and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some flesh-forming substance, from the ointments, until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	But if the end bone of the coccyx breaks, which is the end of the tail: then it is necessary that you insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and align the broken bone with the other hand, according to what is possible, and with secondary alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place upon it, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment which preceded, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	¶ On the repair of the Hip.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The hip bones rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	But if they break, then their fracture is nothing but fragmentation in their extremities: and they split lengthwise, and decline inward: and pain occurs to the patient in the location, and stabbing pain: and the leg which breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And indeed its repair is that you extend your hand over it, until you determine the nature of the fracture's shape.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	But if the fracture is in its extremities only, then align that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from alignment, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is lengthwise, or has already declined inward: then make the patient lie on their belly, until the repair of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	Therefore when you have aligned it, place a plaster upon it: then place upon it a splint of wood, or of leather: and bind with a binding over which you do not fear movement of the fracture, nor removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And align their concavity with that which fills it, until the binding takes it evenly: and instruct the patient to sleep on their back, or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if a hot swelling occurs to it: then cease from its extension and its repair, until the hot swelling subsides: and place upon it what settles it, according to what preceded, then return to its repair: and bind it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if splintering occurs in the bone, or it is fragmented, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Upper Arm.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The upper arm is that which is between the elbow up to the head of the shoulder blade.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	Of which one is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And let two bindings be tied at its two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it be suspended from an elevated place: and let the patient sit upon a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let him cast his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches his armpit, in the middle of which let there be attached the curve of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy above it, so that the assistant may extend it downward.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then let the physician align the fracture with both his hands, until the fracture returns to how it should be.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other method is that the patient lie back upon his neck: and suspend his hand from his neck with a binding.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants, that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other hold below it, and let each of them extend toward his side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with a binding, and above it with another binding: and let each of the two assistants extend them toward their two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one binding be placed under the armpit, and another under the fracture toward the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a binding be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then align the fracture with ease without labor, until when the fracture is aligned as it should be, and is applied with good application: then bind it, if no hot swelling occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if a hot swelling occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it unwashed wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the swelling subsides: then bind it: and the method of binding it is that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then let him gather the forearm over the upper arm itself, and place his open hand over his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place cloth, and bind the forearm over the upper arm, so that the forearm stays in place of splints: if nothing prevents you from that, nor anything of the fractured bone shifts upon you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if you fear that something of the fractured bone might shift upon you, then use splints: and it is that you place over the fracture itself a splint which should be wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between each splint the width of a finger: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers on each side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the splints with the binding which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your binding over the place of fracture should be tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the further the fracture extends, let the binding be lesser.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of the splints and the binding, as we said, in the hour in which you restore the limb immediately, then do it: and if you fear a hot swelling, then leave the binding and splints until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then examine the binding every three days, so that there does not occur in the place itching, or swelling, or food is prevented from reaching the limb, due to the condition of excessive binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore rectify all that, according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are confident that nothing of that will occur: then do not loosen the binding, except after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient's sleeping be upon his back, and his hand upon his stomach: and place under the upper arm a cushion filled with wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And observe in every hour of night, or day, that the position of the fractured limb does not loosen, or the binding become slack.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore rectify all that with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And arrange the patient's food according to the order we prescribed, so that the food should be light at first, until the bone begins to bind: then it is necessary that you make his food more substantial.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is the custom of the upper arm and leg that they bind in forty days: then therefore it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath be administered, and treated with ointments which restore it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	But if the fracture should be ugly, abraded: then do not loosen the bandage and splints from it for up to fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	¶ On the restoration of a Fracture of the Arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are named the two focuses.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is positioned under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the larger focus breaks alone, or the small one: and perhaps they break together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the small upper focus breaks, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower focus breaks, its fracture is bad, and its healing difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse than this is when the two bones break together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone which breaks is the small upper focus, then it is appropriate for the physician during its restoration to apply a small extension with ease, until he aligns it.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the large focus is that which is broken: then it is necessary that he apply a very strong compression.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he position the figure of the hand during its restoration, and its extension stretched over a pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all fingers toward the top: and let the index finger be lower than all fingers, or the rest: and the patient sitting square upon himself, and let the pillow be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height so that the patient does not incur strain.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let an assistant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant should extend similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then let the physician align the bone, until he reduces it according to the best figure that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	But if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then try to reduce every fragment to its place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed a separated splinter appears in it, and pierces the skin, and you have no hope in its restoration: then cut over it, and remove it according to the method which we described in those things which were mentioned before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a singular chapter for that, therefore take its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	But if in the beginning of your restoration a hot swelling occurs, then smear the cloth with a cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a light binding, until when the swelling subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place the splints, and let the splint which is placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most conditions: whether the fracture is in one focus, or in both focuses together.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your binding over the fracture site stronger and more forceful, and somewhat more with binding above the fracture, or below it: or place the binding somewhat softer than its binding, according to what was mentioned before in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths which are wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist cloths: and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is bound be specifically of flax, medium between fine and thick, as we narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And examine the limb and bandage after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	But if something occurs whose correction is necessary, such as itching which occurs to the limb: then it is necessary that you bathe the limb with heated water, until that itching subsides, and you leave the limb not constricted, until it subsides, then repeat the binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	But if the binding has already softened, and the bone has already moved, and similar things to those: then correct all that with your strength, and examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, due to excessive tightness, then it is necessary that you soften it a little, and leave it for several days, until nourishment flows to it, then tighten it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if none of those things we mentioned happens to the patient, then it should not be loosened, except after twenty days, or thereabouts.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the patient's hand be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be level, and let it be protected in its strength from agitating movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this depends on the conditions of the complexions, and the conditions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	¶ On the Treatment of Fractures of the Hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture rarely occurs in the metacarpus of the Hand and in the knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And nothing happens to it except bruising many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore when a fracture or bruising occurs to the palm: then the patient must sit square: and before him should be a seat at the same level.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his Hand extended upon it.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let an assistant extend the broken bones, and let the physician align them, until they are joined in good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and tow, if no hot swelling occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint above according to the size of the area: and you should have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is toward the lower part near the belly of the palm, then make something like a sphere from cloth: and instruct the patient to press upon it with his fractured palm: then bind it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the splint be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the palm: and tighten it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is toward the exterior, then it is necessary: that you place a splint above, and another splint below on the palm: and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then apply the binding, as the hand is turned: and extend between the fingers with the bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	But if a fracture occurs to any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, let it be aligned as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then let it be bound with the palm: and if you wish, place a straight, small splint on it: so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle and index, or little and ring fingers, then let it be aligned, and bound with the healthy finger that follows it: or let them all be bound in continuation: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place upon it a small splint, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your treatment, and after it the condition of hot swelling: and oppose it with what is necessary, when something of that occurs, according to what is repeated in its description.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Repair of a Fractured Hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken, and it becomes apparent to the senses, since it turns toward the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its repair is done thus: a bandage is tightened above the fracture, and another bandage below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient should lie face down.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then the assistant should extend each bandage to its side evenly, and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then the bandage should be placed toward the pubic area, so that the extension goes upward, and another bandage below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then the bandage should be placed near the knee, so that the extension is downward.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician should align the bone with both his hands until he returns it to the likeness of its natural shape, and the bone is joined with a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and binding, if no swelling occurs in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if swelling occurs in it, then leave it for several days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The binding should be done thus:
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap over the fracture a hard bandage, that is, a strip of cloth, and double it two or three times, and let there be excess remaining from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches near the root of the buttock.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee downward, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap over the leg and hip what remains of the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place splints over the hip at the location of its fracture, and place one of them over the leg bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the empty spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the binding is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with strong binding from the middle over the fracture site with three or four wrappings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the further you move with the bandage from the fracture site, let your binding be lesser and softer and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then attend to the two ends of the thread which you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore tie with both the three splints which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with the two ends of the thread downward until you reach the ankle of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both also bind the ends of the splints from the other side, so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the binding upon it while it remains thus, provided that no erosion occurs to the limb, nor swelling, nor inflammation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	But if anything of that occurs:
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Hasten therefore to loosen it, and rectify everything that occurs from it, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed there is a fragment of bone that is piercing, then it is necessary that you align it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, cut over it and remove it, and treat with that whose remembrance has preceded, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this hip fracture is bound without splints being added to it, as we said regarding the shoulder and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in repairing it when fractured in such a way, lameness does not occur in the patient.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is repaired alone, without the other leg being attached to it, then it is necessary that its owner will always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little more is added, or a little less: all that is according to the diversity of constitutions and other conditions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the Repair of Fractures of the Kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that fracture rarely occurs to the kneecap, but bruising happens to it many times.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a fracture occurs to it, then it is nothing but either a crack, or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is either with a wound, or without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And all of this is determined by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its repair is thus, that what is broken from its parts should be evened out with the fingers, until it is brought together and joined according to what is possible in terms of alignment, ease, and craftsmanship.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster made of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white: and place upon it a round splint, if you need it: and bind it above with a binding suitable for that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the conditions which we have described in other fractures: such as hot swelling, and similar things: so that you may counter every symptom with what is appropriate for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the Repair of Fractures of the Leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the Leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called by the name of Leg: and the other thin, and is called the Splint-bone.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And both types of fractures occur to them which occur to the two bones of the arm: and because of that its repair is done just like the repair of the arm equally, and the procedure is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If the two bones break together, the Leg turns to all sides.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone breaks, the Leg turns to the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone breaks, you find it lower: and it is among those things which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, alignment, and binding of splints according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it is necessary, if the fracture of the Leg is an ugly fracture, having many fragments: that the extension be lesser, and gentler in your relief.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And indeed in the Leg there is something in the procedure beyond the arm: and it is that when you align the splints, and complete all your procedure, then take two bands of pine wood, which is used in the construction of floors that is placed under boards: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from those which have small thickness, and are not from the minute ones: and let their length be according to the length of the Leg from knee to below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap each one with cloth in two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the Leg from one side, and the other from the other side: and let them be from the knee to below the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two bands in three places from the two extremities and middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when binding is prevented, the Leg declines to right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed a cradle of wood should be administered according to the length of the Leg, and the Leg should be placed in it, so that it may preserve it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And most importantly it is necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is especially a wound with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then examine the Leg every day, and study it with ultimate attention for swelling, or inflammation, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore any of these occurs, then counter it with what is necessary, until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, fracture never occurs in the heel bone.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the Foot, and fracture rarely occurs in the Toes: and nothing happens to them except crushing in most cases.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If fracture occurs in the bones of the Foot, and you see those bones raised up against each other, then let the patient put his Foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand, and place your Foot on what is elevated from those bones: then press, or step on it: and level it until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster, and put tow on top: and place under the sole of the Foot a small board, which should have two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with the Foot with proper binding, after you wrap it with cloths and other things that are needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones leveled, whether they were fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore the procedure for them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if any toes are broken, then restore them, and align them according to what I told you about restoring the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place on your finger a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be slightly wider than it: then place under the Foot this board which I described to you, and bind it with proper binding.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed what is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place over each toe a splint of its size, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the board to the bottom of the Foot: and let it stand on one of the ends of the board outside the sole of the Foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is proper for you not to forget to consider everything I told you in the remaining fractures about the accidents we mentioned: and oppose each accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	¶ On the fracture of a woman's Vulva, and of the pubic bone, and of a man's penis.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's Vulva is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her slightly toward her back, and let her be held from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her Vulva with cotton, until she fills it: and let it become in the Vulva like a sphere from it.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton comes out, until it becomes before the entrance of the Vulva like a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a small cushion on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	Therefore when she wants to urinate, let her remove the cotton carefully, then urinate: and return it according to the way in which you first inserted it: then let her return to her first cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do that for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself heals.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and bind over its opening a reed pipe, and insert the whole bladder into her Vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the pipe with force, until the bladder inflates inside the Vulva, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with cotton, and let it remain for some days, according to what we described, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the pubic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and its leveling that which we described for the hip bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the correct way is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially for one who has some study or practice.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine much, since the fracture itself indicates to you in most cases the right way in its restoration and its binding: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when a man's penis is broken, take a goose's throat: and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a wrapping of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and let it be left for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, God willing.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	¶ On the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is appropriate for one who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, like a hip bone or shoulder bone or similar to it, that you hurry and bleed them immediately, if the conditions for bloodletting are favorable, as we mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound is flowing with blood, then it is necessary that you hurry to stop it, by sprinkling powdered vitriol over it, if nothing else is available to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, unless inflammation occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If however hot inflammation occurs, then leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the inflammation subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth day at all, for you would cause bad complications.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however the fractured bone is protruding above the skin exposed: then you must try to reduce it and align it with your hands with gentleness and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If however its extension and alignment cannot be achieved with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is about seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them according to the amount needed for treatment in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it does not bend during compression upon it at the time of operation: and let it be sharp-pointed, with an edge at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be of thickness from its middle down to its lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that its curved sharp end be placed on the end of the protruding bone: and push it with it once, until when the bone returns and is somewhat aligned.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore try to align the ends of the fracture with each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	But if its fractured end is thin, and the instrument cannot get a good grip on it, then it is necessary that you cut the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If however you cannot reduce them with what we have described at all, then cut it with what is suitable from the cutting instruments we mentioned: or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small fragments.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and the patient finds severe damaging pain after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you bring great benefit to the patient when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then submerge a cloth in astringent black wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not put wax ointment on the wound, nor anything containing oil: lest it cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then apply splints at the time you complete the bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound exposed: so that you cut with scissors a hole in the bandages according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take every precaution not to constrict the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times foolish physicians have done this: and have caused either death, or gangrene, or zuche (that is, pus) to occur in their patients.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your binding be soft, gentle, different from the binding of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	But if the wound is bad, or if the wound is large, and you fear over it certain bad complications which we have described, and you find persistent pain in the area: then you should not put splints on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make bandages for them from hard cloths in place of splints, and bind it with these.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When it has been one day or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus: then remove from above it the cloth which you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer lint cloths and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is proper for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every day morning and evening, until it consolidates and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that pus flows from it downward with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	But if many days pass for the wound, and it does not consolidate, nor does the pus cease from it: then know that there are small bone fragments there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary that you examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	However many of those bone fragments are loose, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those which are not separated, and which prick the limb and cause pain to occur, try to cut them and remove them in whatever way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	But if zuchen or ekileten (that is, gangrene) occurs in the wound, or another type of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary that you treat each of these with what is appropriate for it from the treatment, whose description preceded in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And among that which it is necessary that my discourse should emphasize, and to which you should give your present attention when a bone is broken and protrudes over the limb, like the hip bone and shoulder bone and similar ones from the large limbs, is that you should not attempt to pull it, for often death occurs from that, but rather leave it until it decays.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore treat the wound, if it seems right to you: and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	¶ On the Treatment of Nodules in the Site of a Fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This Nodulation often occurs in the site of a healing fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially that which is near the joints: and the appearance of the limb is disfigured by it.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider therefore then, if the nodule is recent: administer medicines which have astringency to it, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things to these.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, take some of these, or all of them: and combine them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them over the nodule in tow, and bind them over it with good binding.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the binding, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and repeat another, until the nodule is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind a lead plate over it appropriately.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the nodule has already turned to stone, and is tight, and necessity quickly calls for removing it: then cut into it from its upper part, and cut away the protruding excess: or scrape it with certain rasps, until it is removed: and treat it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	¶ On the Treatment When it is Restored, and the Limb Afterward Remains Thin, Not According to its Nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored, and the limb afterward remains thin, weak: then this happens only because of many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, frequent loosening of the bandage and binding it not according to what is proper: or because of excessive tightness of the bandages, until nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb: or because of excessive moistening at the wrong time: or because of scarcity of blood in the patient's body, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its treatment is to feed the patient, and to make his body soft, until blood multiplies in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch on the limb: so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And continue its moistening with tepid water, until nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural appearance.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	¶ On the treatment of fractured bones when they heal crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a limb that has already healed after treatment becomes crooked, and there is a protrusion of the fractured bone, or a nodule: and the form of the limb is disfigured by it, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural function: then you should not accept the advice of one who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have indeed been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this procedure is indeed very blameworthy, leading to death, or great fear, namely that it might be fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and nodule are recent: then it is necessary to apply fomentation with tepid water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves, and its root, and melilot, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make a plaster for it with a softening plaster, such as properly made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucilage of marshmallow root, and shake it with chicken fat, or sesame oil: and make a plaster with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take fat figs, and grind them with pigeon dung, and similar things which are named among medicines that reduce consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the nodule is dissolved with persistent, long-term, and gentle friction, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb should be administered in all directions at all times.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the crookedness has already preceded, and has become strong, and has turned to stone, and there has arisen a necessity for treating it with iron: then it is necessary that its upper part be cut, and the continuity of the bone be broken, and what is excessive from the nodule or bone be cut away with fine cutting tools: and ease should be administered in that with care and attention.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	¶ On the Discussion of Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of any joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Whereby it is prevented from its movement, and the shape of the limb is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pains and injuries to come upon the patient.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore when dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hurry to its treatment: and do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the area becomes inflamed, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Because of that therefore it is not proper to move it, nor to extend it during the time of its inflammation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Since many times it causes spasm and harmful pains to occur.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then it is necessary that you hurry to bleed the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left until the inflammation subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be fomented with hot water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with care.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every limb should be treated with that which mention will come of in its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I indeed have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, also according to what preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated except on rare occasions.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Either they are removed from their places by a small displacement, and are slightly loosened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated with a complete, full dislocation, until they loosen towards the chest, until the patient's saliva runs, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue becomes involved in speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When its dislocation is small, then it returns in most cases by itself with little intervention.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete, full: then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and it is that an assistant should hold the patient's head: and the physician should insert the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the dislocated jaw between its bone, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should insert both his thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he aligns it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to clear his jaws, and release them for chewing in every direction.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician should align the jaw, and push the jaw, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved together: then administer steam with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	Therefore when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth closes, and they do not loosen: then place cushions of cloth over them, with a wax plaster that is made from wax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be bound gently with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the patient should sleep on his back: and his head should be positioned between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor should he attempt, or be forced to chew anything: rather his food should be made into a mild soup, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is knitted: then he may eat what he wants, and this should be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not strain over the operation of his mouth in eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is knitted, and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	But if the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places: then often fevers occur from this, and persistent headache: and perhaps the patient's bowels are loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore when you see this: then know that it is destruction, and often the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of dislocation of the Clavicle, and the extremity of the upper arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	Indeed the clavicle is not dislocated from the inner side, because of its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated to the outside: and this is apparent to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the patient should lie on his back, and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then compress the area with your palm with strong compression, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster over it, and cushions, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	Indeed its extremities which follow the elbow, and are connected with it, are not dislocated, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it is dislocated on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and aligned according to what we said, and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster over it, and cushions, and a bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the patient to maintain tranquility and rest, until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the extremity of the upper arm is reduced, when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	¶ On the Reduction of Dislocation of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder can only be dislocated in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is when it is dislocated towards the armpit downward.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is when it is dislocated towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And sometimes it is dislocated to the upper part of the shoulder: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated posteriorly, because of the shoulder blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated anteriorly, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And most often it is dislocated and moves downward towards the armpit: especially in those whose flesh is sparse.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because in them it moves out quickly, and moves back in quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of this, namely that it moves out with difficulty, and moves back in with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And sometimes it happens to some people that due to a blow, or a fall, the shoulder becomes swollen with a hot swelling, and because of this it is thought that it has been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you examine it, until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And a dislocation is recognized when it is downward towards the armpit: and you should distinguish between the dislocated shoulder and the healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find between them a clear difference, and you find in the head of the shoulder a cavity, and under the armpit upon touching the head of the shoulder it is as if it were an egg: and the patient cannot raise his hand to his ear, nor move it in any direction.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upward: then you find clear evidence upon touching, nor is it hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed the reduction of this dislocation becomes easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is thus: let an assistant raise his hand upward.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under his armpit, and raise the joint forcefully upward to its place: and let the assistant raise his hand, and extend it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him lower it, for it returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return by what we have described, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if marshmallow roots, fenugreek, and melilot are cooked in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then let the patient lie on his back: and let there be placed under his armpit a sphere of wool, which should be balanced between softness and firmness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then let the physician place his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the shoulder with force, and pull the patient's arm downward.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And let another assistant hold the patient's head, so that it does not move downward: for it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: that is, have present a man who is taller than the patient, and let him stand at the side, and insert his shoulder under the patient's armpit: and raise his armpit upward, until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And let another assistant pull the patient's arm downward towards his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the patient is light: then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, to weigh him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: that is, let a long piece of wood be fixed in the ground, whose head is round in shape: like the handle of a mortar: which should neither be thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let it be placed under the patient after soft cloths are placed on the head of the wood: and let the patient be standing according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then let his arm be extended downward on one side, and let his body be extended on the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If its reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this treatment: that is, take a wood whose length is the measure of two arms, and its width the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers: which should have a round head, so that its entry into the depth of the armpit is eased, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then let soft cloths be tied over the round head, so that the wood does not harm the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then let it be placed under the patient's armpit, so that the hand or arm is extended over the wood down to the lower parts: and let the wood be tied over the upper arm and forearm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then let the arm be placed over the step of a ladder by its width, and let the hand be extended downward, and let the rest of the body be left suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint goes in immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore its entry is completed in whatever way possible: then it is necessary that you place under the armpit a sphere of equal size made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a plaster prepared from mill dust with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it is wrapped over it.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind beneath the armpit with proper binding: and let the bandage be wrapped over the plaster above: and let his hand be tied to his neck, and let it be left, nor let his hand be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that the patient's food be little, until the limb is strengthened: since it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then let it be made more abundant after seven days, or five, and let it be exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it becomes firm and does not soften, then it has already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If however the joint dislocates many times, because of moisture that affects it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that cautery be administered to it with three holes, according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done, and the bandage is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not secured, and the plaster and binding are reapplied over it several times, and it does not hold firm, and falls, and cannot be raised upward: then know that its nerves which are at the head of the humerus have already been cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The reduction of a dislocation that occurs toward the chest and breast, or toward the back, is accomplished with pushing and extension using the hands: until it returns, and the remaining binding and treatment should be administered to it until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use the bath many times, until that heaviness is relieved, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	¶ On the treatment of Elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the Elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and it can indeed be dislocated to all sides, and especially to the front or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: since it is apparent to sight and touch, in whatever way it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, this becomes clearly evident to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint becomes hollow, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hurry, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot swelling occurs in it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot swelling occurs in it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is toward the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is the worst of all types of dislocations, and causes the most severe pain of them: and death often follows with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is among those that are possible to reduce, is that his hand should be extended with both hands: and his arm should be expanded, and the physician's hands should be above and below the elbow, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of both his hands together, or with the heel of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or if the dislocation is toward the front: then it returns thus, that he should bend the hand with his hand, until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the heel of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer very forceful, strong extension: that is, two assistants should extend the arm: and two assistants should also hold it, so that it does not move during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm should be rotated to every side after a long folded cloth or wide bandage is wrapped around his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil: so that this may be among those things that help in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the joint with forceful pushing, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed over it, in which there should be astringency and drying with egg white: and it should be bound with proper binding.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the patient's neck: and left for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint becomes firm in its place, then remove the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint is not well tightened, then repeat the plaster and bandage, and leave it for several days, until it tightens.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however heaviness occurs in it after reduction of the joint, and there is a condition in movement: then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is soothed, or place upon the joint the fat of a ram's buttock.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it should be bound, and left upon it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and put him in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat the aleliati [possibly a medicinal preparation] on it once, and a second time, and a third time upon entering the bath, until it softens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place wet cow dung on it, warmed with butter, and bind it tight.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it will soften and return to its normal condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the Almahassem [wrist].
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The Mahassem of the hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that there be swiftness in reducing its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the area swells: or a hot swelling occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in it is that you place the Mahassem of the diseased hand on a board, and the assistant extends his hand: and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary that it be observed, if the palm has already receded to the belly of the hand: then the patient should place the back of his hand on the board during the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be internally on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the board, so that the physician's hand falls upon the prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a poultice that reduces swelling: and leave it, and do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it cannot tolerate it, nor can you achieve its reduction, after days pass, however the joint remains according to its crookedness: and it does not harm the patient in any way, except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grip anything: then know that the nerves are severed, or worn away.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no technique for it, except that it should be bound with a cautery near its fall.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that will not help at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore the Almahassem does not return, then place upon it the poultice, which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be bound, and left for five days: afterwards let it be loosened and left, and let the hand be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however its movement is lost, and some heaviness occurs in it: then soften it with heated water, and with friction several times, until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the Fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a Finger from these is dislocated to any part, or from these a Finger to the back of the palm, or its belly: then extend the Finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the Finger, and suspend it toward the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is made straight on that day of its own.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore it is night, bind it according to the same account: and do not cease to loosen it in the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days, until it is tight.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do with it, if it is dislocated to the belly of the hand: and bind it to that part, and do your first operation with it, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to the remaining parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When someone suffers a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back or neck, or many vertebrae are moved from their places: then there is no cure for it, since death hastens to the patient.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the patient's waste comes out without control, and he cannot hold it: and often certain of his limbs become paralyzed, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them: or a single vertebra is moved from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Indeed it often happens that their displacement occurs in four directions.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is displaced toward the back is called Gibbosity [hunchback].
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment for this is that you should then consider, if the Gibbosity occurred from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But for that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things, the ancients have already described methods of treatment in lengthy discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Most of which does not return with benefit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have indeed abbreviated from it, whose little excuses from much of it from my proximity to the intention: and in my exposition which I have explained it, and I have formed its instrument in a different way from that which they showed it, and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore I say that in gibbosity which occurs from the anterior part, there is no remedy, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which occurs to the two sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And none of these are cured, except that which occurs in the back specifically, with that which I describe: and it is that the patient should be stretched out on his face on a level platform near a wall: and a moist bedding should be spread under him, so that his chest is not injured.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight pole be fixed in a pit in the ground, at the end of the platform, around his head: and another pole around his feet at the other end of the platform: and let an assistant hold the pole, and let it not be firmly fixed in the pit.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let another assistant hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap around the patient's head, and under his armpits a soft, firm bandage: and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is at his head: and tie it to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another bandage above his hips, and above his knees, and at his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the other pole which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let each assistant pull the bandage toward the pole's side, and let the two poles not be moved from their places in which they are fixed: however they should not be firmly fixed, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And let the physician place his palms on the vertebra with force, until it returns: or let him place a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then let him attach his feet over the board, until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms' length.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And hollow out in the wall which we said is near the patient, a place into which the end of the board may enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board over the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him press well, until the vertebra is compressed, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, work with the winch which is turned with your hand: and it is that you fix in the ground at the head of the patient at the back of the platform two poles, whose length should be one arm's length: and at his head at the back of the platform two poles.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length which is between each pole be one palm: and already a hole has been made in each place, in which the winch runs: and let each pole be fixed very firmly in the ground, lest it move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round pole be inserted: and it is a winch in which the bandage is wound in the two holes of the two poles.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end there is a hole, in which is fixed a wooden piece, whose length is a palm including what revolves: and in the other two wooden pieces it is similarly so.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the bindings which you fastened on the patient's chest with the turner that is at his head: and the bindings which you fastened on his legs with the turner that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let an assistant stand at each turner, who should turn his hand with the strap by which the turner is rotated: and the physician should align the vertebra, according to what we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turner that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the vertebra returns and the area is aligned, then it is necessary that you apply a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then [apply] tow (hemp/flax fibers).
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards place above the plaster a splint made from a board, whose width should be three fingers, or thereabouts.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should be enough to cover the area of the hump and over part of the healthy vertebra.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then let it be bound with the binding we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the patient use light nourishment until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	But if some protrusion remains in the area at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the application of the board which we described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And a lead plate is now applied to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a protrusion occurs in the back of the spine's vertebrae: and through this a dislocation is suspected, and it is that bone which protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore one should not attempt this treatment on it: for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	¶ On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the joints of the hip and the joints of the shoulder suffer nothing but complete dislocation: nor do they suffer what happens to other joints from slight displacement and hollowing.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the hip joint is dislocated in four directions.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it dislocates forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And most often it dislocates inward: and rarely dislocates forward and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation inward is: that when you join the patient's healthy leg with the injured one, it is longer: and his knee protrudes more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his foot at the groin: and the area following the groin is swollen with hot swelling, because the head of the hip has arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of one who has suffered dislocation outward is that his symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one who has suffered dislocation forward is that he extends the healthy leg completely: however he does not bend it without pain which is in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot [move] forward on it: and his urine is retained, and his groin swells, and when walking his stepping is on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of one who has suffered dislocation backward is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin: and his leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the location of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of these types of dislocation is that you should then consider if the dislocation is old, which has already become chronic in the one having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains in its condition: then there is no treatment for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore one should not attempt it at all.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in one whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four types of dislocation: then hasten to rotate the joint, and extend it inward and outward, and move it right and left: for perhaps it will return, and does not need other treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if it does not return this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he should extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a binding, which is tied over his leg above the knee: and another assistant should extend his hand from above, so that he puts his hands under his armpits.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then let him bind with a soft bandage above the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let its extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the collarbone area, or from the posterior to the back area.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all of them be at once, until the patient is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains suspended.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And indeed this type of extension is a common type among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then each type needs that which I will speak of regarding proper treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In its proper reduction when the dislocation is toward the interior, it is necessary that the patient lie back on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then place the bandage above the root of the hip, in that area which is between the head of the hip and the place below the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upward from the groin area to the higher part of the body, to the collarbone area.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong assistant take his arms, and reduce the thick area of the diseased hip, and extend it outward with vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Indeed it has already returned to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the remaining types of treatment by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it defies you, and does not yield to entry with this type of treatment at all: then it is necessary that the patient's two feet be bound together with a strong, soft bandage, above the two heels and above the two knees: and let the distance of each from its partner be four fingers' width: and let the diseased leg be extended more than the other by two fingers' width.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the patient be suspended over the head of a wooden beam, which should be in the house: and let its height from the ground be two arms' length.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong young man to secure the head of the hip: and let another young man be suspended with the patient: and let another young man, securing the hip, push with force, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In its proper return, when the dislocation is outward, it is necessary that the patient lie on a bench, according to what we described for one having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the bandage be bound over his diseased leg specifically, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then let two wooden pieces be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let an additional piece of wood be placed in the middle of the bench, firmly fixed: over which wet cloths are wrapped, so it does not harm the patient: and let the wood be between his hips, so it is not pulled downward during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let each assistant extend toward his side, and let the physician equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it yields to return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place a board over it, and press it, as we said in the case of the hump, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is toward the front, then it is necessary that the patient's leg be quickly extended: and it is according to this same account upon a podium: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand over the patient's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then let him compress it with the other hand, and with that compression place it extended downward toward the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is toward the back: then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downward, and be elevated above the ground: rather it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard surface, just as is necessary if his hip is dislocated outward, according to what we said about his lying on both hips: and he is on his face, and the ligaments extended: according to what we just said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also over the place to which the joint exits, when the reduction is completed as necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend the patient's two legs: and when you see them equal, and the patient tightens his leg, and extends it without excuse: then know that the limb has already returned as necessary: then join the two thighs, and apply a plaster, and bind with an imemati, that is, a wheel: so that the hip does not move to any side: and let the patient adhere to rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation has already been secured: therefore release the patient to walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any looseness: then return, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make him delay in walking on both for some days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	¶ Concerning Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, that is, backward.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to join his leg to his thigh.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If however it does not join with the thigh: then know that the Knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all types of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he extends his leg if he can upon it, and your back joins to his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his Knee join with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over his Knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm both sides of his Knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And let another assistant extend his foot, until the Knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg joins with the thigh in smoothness, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it, and make the leg join with the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a band for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the patient not use walking for some days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If however its reduction is refused to you, then administer strong extension with bandages, whose account preceded in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Heel
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel sometimes moves with a small displacement, and sometimes becomes completely dislocated.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding toward the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its displacement is easy to reverse: it is to extend it gently with the hands and align it until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In treating it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you have the patient sit upright: and a very strong assistant should hold him from behind his back, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you hold his foot with your right hand from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot toward you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left hand twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left, and push the instep with the right hand toward the leg without strain.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the instep toward the leg a third time, while you pull the ankle.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it returns in one or two attempts in this way, and you see the foot aligned, it is good: and if not, then repeat the procedure on it: for it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if you are prevented from reducing it with what we have described: then have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a peg firmly in the ground, so that it falls between his hips: and you have already wrapped cloth around it, so it does not harm the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let an assistant take his thigh: afterward let another assistant extend the foot, either with his hands or with a bandage tied over the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let each assistant pull against the extension of his companion: and let the peg stand between the patient's two thighs holding him, so that his body is not drawn downward during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the physician align the dislocation with his hands, and let another assistant hold the healthy leg downward.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and its proper return becomes clear to you: then apply a plaster and tow, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot to the leg with a bandage.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or fear for the nerves, which are behind above the heel, so that the bandage is not too tight over them, and harm them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage loosens, tighten it: then loosen it on the third or fourth day: and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If indeed he attempts to walk before that period, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not recur in him, and become corrupted, and not accept treatment after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	But if a hot swelling occurs to him: then it is necessary that you administer for its calming that which we have previously described in another place regarding treatment and fomentation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the Dislocation of the Toes, and Treatment
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that whatever is dislocated from them be aligned with little extension without strain: and that indeed is not difficult, rather it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in some of the joints of the top of the foot: then it is necessary that the patient sit with his foot on a level place on the ground, or on a board: and he is standing as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot over what protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with force, until it returns, and you see it aligned, and no protrusion appears in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the sole of his foot a board which takes the whole foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with appropriate binding for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secured from recurrence.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	¶ On the types of dislocation with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this sort happens, and you attempt its treatment and its restoration, death often follows: and because of this, it is not proper that anyone should undertake the treatment of such a case, unless he is skilled in the art through long practice, compassionate, dutiful, cautious, neither bold nor presumptuous: and that he should use at the beginning only medicines which reduce hot swellings: and leave the patient to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for recovery from destruction with mildness of the illness, and in which there appears some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot swelling occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that reduces swelling: and treat the wound with what is suitable for it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	But if the dislocation is with fracture, and separated bone fragments occur, then attempt their removal, and do in that case what we said about simple conditions from what preceded in their sections.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear: according to what I previously advised you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you before your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and safer for your body among those in your time.
