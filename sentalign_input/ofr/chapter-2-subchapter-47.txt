Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupt, so much so that they resemble women's breasts; and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wishes to treat them, must cauterize them according to this form from this line .b. up to .g.:
then peel away the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitching, and treat it until it is healed; and if the breast hangs down, and is softened by its size as happens with women, then cut it into two sides above, by two similar incisions; of which one joins the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line .b. up to line .g.; then peel the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply there what we have said about stitching and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed; and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the bleeding, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
