On the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter 29.
When pain occurs in the liver due to cold and moisture, or from thick winds, disrupting its natural balance by excess, and treatment as prescribed does not help, then the patient should lie on his back, and mark with ink three cauteries in this shape and this same size below the hypochondria, at the point where the elbow meets: allow space between each cautery the width of a finger, and let the cautery be straight in the length of the body; do not press your hand too hard with the cautery.
Let the amount burned be half the thickness of the skin, not more; and let the patient be standing on his feet.
If he is not standing, then he should be lying down, with his legs extended and arms raised.
This is the shape of the cautery.
Indeed, it is possible to perform these cauterizations with a knife-like cautery, provided you possess skill and precision in the art.
Be cautious not to go too deeply with the cauterization, so as not to burn the full thickness of the skin, for this would burn the entire body and reach the intestines, as the skin there is thin; know this well.
