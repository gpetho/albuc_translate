the procedure is such that you take a delicate needle, and place a soft and delicate silk thread in it; then join the ends and tie them both subtly, and let the length of the threads be a palm in length; then prepare in the loop another delicate silk thread shortly, and tie the ends of the thread; then let the patient place his head in your lap; and let it be near the sunlight so that the procedure is illuminated, for it is a delicate and fine procedure, then place the needle with the loop in the root of the added hair, and make it pierce the eyelid quickly until you pull it above the natural hair; then pull the hair up to the loop, and place in the loop that hair, if there are one or two or three or more; then pull your hand so that the hairs come out with the loop in the eyelid with the natural hair.
And if the loop is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, then you will pull the loop downwards with the thread that you have prepared in it, until the loop comes out from the hole above and you see it with the eye; then you will pull the loop and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hairs are attached to their place and flesh grows over them; and if the hairs are small, then accompany them with a long hair from the natural hair, and let it be raised with it or leave it, until it is extended and then lift it.
