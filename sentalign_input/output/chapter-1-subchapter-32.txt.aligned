On the cauterization of the feet and thighs.	On cauterization of the legs and feet.	0.98001355
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with yellow water, you should cauterize the feet on the top between the little toe and the ring toe, lift your hand with the cautery without twisting it; then lift your hand and do not completely return it, because the yellow water will discharge.	When, in the sufferer from dropsy, these swell and become full of yellowish fluid, you should cauterize the upper surface of the feet in the depression between the little and fourth toes; hold your hand upright with the cautery; do not let it slant. Then remove your hand and do no more cauterization whatever; for the yellowish fluid will exude.	0.81685144
The cauterization is done in this way: make two cauterizations on both thighs, and on each thigh, the cauterization should be done with the tip of the knife-shaped cautery. The cauterizations should be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh; and make two cauterizations on each thigh.	The cautery should be of this type. Then sear the legs with two cauterizations on each leg; cauterize with the bladed end of the cautery, and let it be along the length of the leg: one under the knee, the other lower than that, about the middle of the leg; and two more cauterizations over each femur.	0.87915254
Leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some of the water can discharge from it.	Leave the burns open without treatment for a long while during which the fluid will exude from them.	0.813239
