Certainly, O fellow! Please complete this book which is the last of science and medicine for its completion in it and through its disclosures, and by its declarations, I urge you to please comply with that towards this treatise, as it is a part of surgery itself.
Certainly, O fellow! The operation is now closed in our region and time of private disclosure; it is very light on the science itself, and its witness has ended; and except a few descriptions in ancient books, which can be found, they will correct any errors and clarify any doubts about what we have learned from it and what follows.
Certainly! You should now translate this treatise following the way of disclosure and declaration, as well as abbreviation; and to be added are the forms of cautery tools and other instruments of that work with its addition of declaration preparation which is necessary.
Certainly! The reason for which the artifex failed in our time is that the art of medicine is long and to know from which actor practicing this science anatomy as we continue with Galen into knowing the youth members forms and how they are connected, separated, and have their names listed with their roles.
"And for this reason Ypocras says that it is called 'major' in the small arts and 'minor' in the large ones.
"For those who do not understand the anatomy of this matter, they are in error and may die from it as well, just like someone has seen many examples where such things happen frequently when people have no knowledge or understanding of these sciences.
"When a surgeon found an abscess in the groin of a woman and incised some arteries from it to prevent large blood loss that could kill her among many.
"Another surgeon decided to remove the tumor of a man in his state, and it was large, and he cut off part of his bladder so that the man would not die on the third day.
"You have already appealed to separate that, and saw that because of the size of the tumor and the condition of the patient, he would die.
"Another surgeon who took a stipend from our country for surgery, even set on a black castrating that was to be fractured in the chest of him; and because of his ignorance he fractured it instead over the lungs and the heart, causing him great pain.
When the patient's desires are known and approved by you, open the door to the bedchamber, make preparations for intercourse, remove any coverings of the body, and after washing yourself properly, enter into it with your partner.
You have called upon him and he will open the door to make love, after which you both will find tranquility and forget your pains.
However, if the corruption is already established in a member and cannot be removed without causing harm to that member or any other part of his body.
Another doctor who performed a cautery also inflamed the patient's feet after several days, and it was noticeable that he had malice towards his lord.
The cause of which is cold humors is purely accidental and not all parts are affected; instead the part that suffers most from this is the one that was covered in it.
For this reason you are advised to make two operations: one is for the member that is associated with health and another is for the part that is in greater danger.
You have already succeeded in this matter at that place where an operation was performed which was an error and fear: so you must keep it safe as well, to prevent others from speaking against your order or striking you.
When you have opened a space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands, here comes
Through the grace of God, may you find salvation and success in your lives, bear terrible evils with ease in healing, and bear your weapons that now cause terror upon you, so that through faith and by the name of Jesus Christ you will not perish: for how much more shall remain to your glory, and with the one and other among your saints.
In regard to certain matters which No matter illness shall not be called ill doctors.
And you have to decide on three capitals.
Begin the division of liberty, and first of all choose a starting point The first capital ordered from the bottom of the foot, in the forms of instruments and in the movements of the cautery, and that which is necessary for operation.
The division of the second part. The second capital, from which hole to make a perforation, and of the vein, and of the plague, and of the extraction of scales and of the arrangement with those on top, all capitals ordered in the forms of instruments.
The third capital is to repair and move around it, and the act of straightening and straightening it.
Determine what kind of incision you need to make with cautery and how deep it should be, and in which combination is prohibited cautery.
The vocabulary of the quality of youth and the quantity from it is long and prosaic, subtle in nature, and secret.
Cautery is used universally as the material or materials it contains, except for two combinations.
In the combination of dry and hard materials it is burned; if any one of them should be too young to that, and others should be contrary to that, cautery not suitable in bad weather due to its quality and dryness.
And so it is contrary to that, because for cautery is always young in all bad weather hard and dry parts of the body where when you compare the body of man and the humidity of him with the combination of fire, you see the body of men burned.
When the pain of the joints is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, then it is customary to call it gout among doctors
This sentence is very difficult to translate since it doesn't have a direct equivalent in English and its grammar and structure are not similar to Latin or any other language I can think of at the moment. It seems like an attempt to convey complicated medical information, possibly related to joint pain or exercise routines for some ailment that affects men specifically.
This sentence suggests that complications arise in the joints when cold humors or damp conditions are prevalent and doctors often agree on this issue but may not always prioritize it early during examinations for other ailments.
This sentence implies that when focusing on care and curing of ulcers, the warmth or heat applied during cautery is crucial for its effectiveness but only to the part being treated and not spread to other parts of the body unless specifically intended as a preventive measure.
This sentence suggests that the application of medical remedies is applied to those affected members and may cause side effects or complications in other parts of the body if not used carefully.
This sentence suggests that heat has its own properties and substance that are beneficial but can also be harmful if not used properly. It encourages experimenting with different methods of truth discovery related to its effects in the body's organs or expulsion of ailments, as the text implies it would be demonstrated by philosophers as a virtue in illnesses.
When doctors decide to perform cautery it should be done at a moment that is most advantageous in terms of healing time
You are saying that cautery should be performed at any time, in order to prevent the discomfort caused by waiting for a longer period of time, especially when it's about urgent pains or necessary pains which would otherwise take too long and cause discomfort, therefore making it advisable to perform cautery quickly.
You are saying that doctors should not perform cautery on those who do not accept or support the general population and its physicians, because if cautery were to be performed when necessary it would cause long periods of waiting time for healing which could lead them to regret their choice.
The cause is that the cautery procedure itself changes the body composition and affects the humidity levels which are a cause of pain
However, cautery should be performed very carefully to ensure the well-being and health of its patient as it involves a significant surgical operation.
It is also possible that the pain may return at a later time due to the composition of the patient and its location within the body, as well as the fluids in their body which have caused the pain, therefore it would be advisable not to perform cautery if necessary, so that there will never be any pain recurrence.
When the vulgar language is about cauterization being a remedy for medicine, it seems rather strange that I cannot understand what you mean here as to whether or not you believe this to be an appropriate use of cautery in addition to medical care.
The cause is contrary to this; and I understand that cauterization being a remedy for medicine only applies when administering the methods of cure in certain ailments, such medicines do not confer benefit, and at the end of the cause administer cautery along with it. The pain caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body is known to doctors as gout.
The ancients believed that cautery was the most important treatment for cauterizing, and they did not do it only for its equality in nature with its substance.
When performing cautery with fire on the eye, make sure not to declare it and prepare to receive it; if you adjust over it ignites it in the fire, which may cause blisters from the cauterizer causing an occupation of that part.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
The first sentence.
This cauterization is caused by coldness and humidity on the surface of the body which can lead to a variety of symptoms such as severe headaches from the top of the head to the soles of the feet and palms of the hands, difficulty sleeping, pain in teeth and gums, and overall weakness throughout the entire body.
The form of this cauterization is to command the patient to remove himself from a hot bath for three or four days next until exhaustion and then examine his face, ears, eyes, nose, throat, and other areas to ensure that he has no other ailments.
You command him to shave his head and place a bandage between your hands on the table so that you can place it over his chest.
Place a cushion under their thighs, another on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands And if the tongue was found in a different location, please note that location and try to use olive oil as the cautery.
And place it on top of that location, make sure you're standing straight and try to gently move it there.
And gently lift your hand and look at the location, if you find that there is some amount of fat on top, then increase the size gradually as well, and if it does not come off easily, try another part or method, depending on whether they are frozen or not.
And sprinkle a little salt over the location and leave it there for three days.
And place it on top of your forehead and let it sit there until the area is completely dry from the heat. And take care of the location with tetra-farmacón, which should be safe.
When the plague is gone and many people get better quickly, it's most fortunate and most youthful.
And do not let the cautery on top of your nose become too dry and cause any damage to its surface.
When pain occurs in the feet (gout), it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When a pointed cautery is used on the buttocks to release pain that has spread there. It's believed in this location the cold humors are released.
The bandage was applied for a long time and is now cured.
If you do not find any specific cautery points anywhere else, but if the head is affected in a way that worries or frightens you, and it is necessary for the solution of continuity to continue as has been testified by other members more frequently when the head of the patient is naturally flat
The first specific cautery point to be used should be saved, and in this way best possible solution is given.
Second.
Of the head cautery points.
When the chronic pain of the head becomes prolonged and it is in a patient with a flat head, use cauteries such as cauteries on the legs, buttocks, back, chest, elbows, wrists and forehead. And most often if the cause was cauterized to another cautery that does not heal or remove the causes mentioned above, doctors consider whether the head of the patient is naturally flat. If it is not flat, they would cauterize with another cautery from below. When it concerns the forehead between two people who wish to kiss each other's cheeks, then an opening is made by a pointed cautery. Insert the opening and let it be opened by a pointed cautery in the part of the head where it is called "the parting" - and this opening is being held shut And spread your hand in that way and do not open the mouth, because the patient is experiencing great pain from this different to all other cauteries of the head
You are to direct this cautery to its place, which is the cautery of the head and the occipital area that has a more subtle kind of cautery, as such one located at the back of the head; it's called the occipital cautery
And there you are
Cautery procedure is not antique.
When the pain in the head is severe or occurs between the eyebrows, then the patient must be treated with a strong medical treatment, and if necessary another cure will also be applied; it's not preferable to wait until the pain stops, because the cautery procedure should either involve acute medicine, or
The cautery procedure using acute medicine is that you press a small amount of alum into the patient's hand and apply it to both temples of their head. When joint pain infiltrates each part of the body, causing pain in the feet, it is traditionally referred to as gout by doctors.
Then tighten the bandage around the affected area, leaving it in place for three hours; and apply a poultice with two or three times daily, keeping its surface moist to prevent maceration of the skin at the site of application.
Then take care of him as soon as he is well.
If you have any medicines that you used in the previous treatise on medical remedies, please list them here.
The second method of cautery should be as follows: apply a cauterizing device of the type mentioned below to the affected area
It is called a corkscrew, in which shape the head of it resembles that of an awl and its middle part is slightly bent.
Then pause on the affected area, and remove your hand - to prevent injury from applying too much force  - and gradually reduce its size over time.
If the amount of force required to puncture the bandage is greater than what your hand can apply without causing injury, remove it and reapply a new one until there is no further bleeding.
When you have opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands, you will now administer a decoction of salt water to that area for three days; and after that, treat with mulhat oil on the body part so as to make it whole again.
If you are going to burn the extremity of the finger with a cautery, make sure that artery incision is not made in this part of the body especially on an ancient site
The fourth quarter.
Ancient artery cautery.
When you cure an emigrane artery as described in the previous care and in the divisions of malautias (the same as before), but if you fail to do so, then pay attention that this cautery should be used only when the ulcer or hernia is healed well enough for its incision to heal properly. After placing your hand over the site of pain along the length of the ulcer or hernia, apply a poultice and wait until it becomes warm and stiff; then gently cut into the artery and pull out through the nose.
However, it is necessary to also guard against the continuation of the mandible which can cause difficulty in chewing and may irritate the nerves that control that area, and prevent a spasm from occurring.
When the arteries are blocked with cold and hard blood flow occurs in the patient, who is terrified, and most importantly, those who do not know what to do and are unprepared, let this operation begin
You will remember the order of blood flow accidents in the arteries following a particular method
If you find that the disease is not controllable with this cautery and you find it necessary to cauterize elsewhere on the head as well
If you find that there are two blockages in the arteries of the chest as well, and it is more advisable to perform this operation here than elsewhere.
The heart
Cauterization of the pains of the heart.
When the earache arises from cold and hard causes that cannot be cured with the previous cautery or another cauterization done in a division, if the pain is not relieved by this one either, doctors will call it a point
Then apply the pointed cautery to all parts of the ear so that it is turned around or in the circuit of each attempt if the pain occurs in any one part. "When you hold it tightly on the edge of her navel, you will feel its tip approaching.
If you place a point on the entire areola and also above it, then apply pressure to the spots inside where they are sore.

Treatment for burns
Burn treatment is the application of ointments and cauteries that come from the veins as we mentioned in the sections on wounds.
Cautery for a rash or spasm caused by dryness or nerve tension.
When you treat this rash with care and attention, apply three cauteries in a specific order: first the edge of her navel, then place another on your temple, and thirdly place two more on both lips.
Pause before applying any cauteries to prevent the rash from worsening in the part that has already been affected.
The way to apply the cautery is to put it on the right side of her areola and above a small portion of her forehead, then another on her temple, making sure that the length of it corresponds with the length mentioned earlier, as well as applying pressure until all the moisture from the affected area has been evaporated.
This is a method of cauterization, especially for the surgeon's use, which we call mesha. The caution is that excessive moisture may cause a small amount to be superfluous fat.
And you should apply it with great care, so as not to cause harm when performing the procedure.
Thank you!

Cautery on the eyelid area
When treating fistula on the eyelid area as mentioned in the previous instructions, first have the patient close their eyes tightly, and place a cloth or gauze between their two hands to prevent any movement of the head during the cautery procedure.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customary to call gout among doctors.
And if it's necessary to make a point on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.

If one penetrates into the other extremity as well. And if you want to do so with both hands as well.
However, anyone who does this must be careful when performing it on the patient's abdomen.
And after placing it if it is necessary to press hard on the fistula and remove all moisture from around it. If not, then open that and extract any remaining pus.
After burning the cautery and placing it on your palm, put that hand over the patient's nose, such that neither their hand nor the patient is burned, and place the other hand in front of their mouth to prevent them from being burned as well, then remove the cautery from around the nose and burn it.
If the cautery enters through the nose at first time, it's fine; if not, place it another way or two times as needed; and leave that for three days, after which you should then put it on the body surface to be dried out until it is dry enough so that it will not harm.
When there is a feverish illness without any signs of healing, then the doctors wait to apply a caustic medicine within those two hours that were mentioned in their article.
Another form of cautery for sealing the opening is to enter into it and then hold it closed with a pointed cautery in that small gap from which it occurs; and after doing this, place your hand over its hole as mentioned above or below, so that the pointed cautery does not come out through the hole.
If the fistula has been cured with cautery and care mentioned above, then yes; otherwise, it is necessary to administer a nosebleed treatment to reduce the fistula down to its original location.

Treatment of toothache.
When toothache is caused by coldness or dampness, heat it with hot water and/or vinegar; if no treatment works from medicine, then cautery on the surface of a foot will be applied as a second option
Cautery on the surface is to put a hot foot pad over it and apply it on the painful tooth with a finger, making sure that you do not burn yourself while doing so, until the tooth becomes cold.
Then apply the cautery in small quantities as needed to bring heat from the fire towards the root of the tooth.
If so, place the pad or cloth over it and apply heat until the fire goes out of control towards your own body.
When performing cautery on the patient's genitals, be careful not to touch any part of his body other than those parts being treated and avoid causing burns in his chest area or increasing its heat as it could cause pain at the patient's mouth.
Make sure the form of cautery is correct, place your hand over it to make it cool down, and do this several times as pain may increase or occur on different days.
To perform the cautery, make sure to prevent the patient from spitting and hold his mouth open for one hour while also placing it on their chest so that they can breathe easily during this time. This is how the cautery should be performed.
Cautery may need to be done in such a way as not to cause unnecessary harm.
The form of the needle is this:

When the patient's urine is very dark in color and accompanied by dryness of the whole body, doctors will order that the bladder be evacuated with laxatives, and then burn it at the spot where it was found.
Be careful not to apply too much of the cautery on the bladder, and do not comb the incision either, just a little
Burn another cautery into the junction between the rectum and the thigh. The cautery of him shall be done in the same manner as before.
Then apply that which was done previously until healing is complete.

Cauterization of pneumonia and coughs
When the pleurisy from the lungs causes dampness and the patient does not have a fever or chills, and it is an ancient ailment, doctors will burn the skin with two points on either side of the breastbone in those places where they breathe out air forcefully; and another point between the breasts.
If you wish, then place your cautery points in the same location as where pain occurs at the joints.
The points are placed inside that area and you apply a remedy to alleviate any subsequent pain there.
And if the treatment for those points is threefold, with three points in this manner:
xxv
The cautery for the top of the thigh.
When the top of the thigh is dislocated due to dampness and cannot be fixed at the time of its return you should place it in that position until it returns on its own, then gently move it slightly so that it can do as we have stated, doctors will say that first reduce dislocation, then put the intestine back into its cavity or hernia.
And prepare the pointed cautery as follows
And pierce another hole into the other lateral, then arrange the cauterization of the two holes
And adjust the amount of attempts accordingly, following these rules.
Then put your hand on the patient's forehead and gently press down to stop any bleeding, ensuring that the limb does not move while being supported.
If the dislocation is at joints of the extremities and the pain is confirmed, then doctors burn onto a muscle with a pointed cautery or between the fingers to confirm that the joint is fixed and the humidity has been increased and the patient feels better.
This completes the sixteenth chapter of our medical treatise.
The treatment for stomach ulcers.
The treatment for stomach ulcers: when you feel pain in the abdomen and notice excessive mucus, take three punctures between the ribs or costal cartilages of the ribcage to confirm the diagnosis, then cauterize each hole with a triangular shaped cautery as follows: puncture one hole for the amount of one digit on the forefinger tip, two holes between the two ribs, such that it forms a triangle; and extend them so they do not come together.
When making incisions for a curettage procedure, make sure to measure the depth of the two blades used in order to prevent any complications from occurring during surgery
The shape of the cautery should be chosen according to this form. If you wish, a larger cautery may also be used on the stomach in that form, and this is another cautery in the shape of a circle for that same form
If you wish to use the cautery on the stomach, puncture it with that same cautery and, afterwards, if necessary, apply another cautery in its points. And make sure any previous cauteries are removed before proceeding.

Cautery procedure for the foot
When the foot gets pain due to cold or dampness or excess moisture inside its normal structure, and it is necessary that the patient's bowels are being treated in order for an excessive discharge from them not to occur, then place the patient on a couch with their head elevated so that they do not have difficulty lying down.
The space between each cautery should correspond to the breadth of the fingers and the length of the chest.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, it is customary for doctors to call this gout.
The quantity of the gout that is applied on the surface of the foot should be appropriate in quantity to the length of the finger's span, and not too much; if the patient is lying down, then the gout will spread out and stretch his legs.
If it's possible to use cauteries of this type on the cutaneous cauteries when one has both subtlety and prudence in their art.
Remember that you should not overdo it in the cautery, and apply a sufficient amount of the ointment all over the body so that it covers the whole body and penetrates into the bowels as well, for this is subtlety; remember this
Chapter xxviii.
About making a hole in an artery with a cautery.
When you want to cut an artery in the leg and wish to know if it is in the muscle of the leg or in the tunic of the patient, doctors will tell you that it is in the muscle of the leg; pain arises from this.
If it is in the tunic of the leg, and the pain is great and sometimes doctors get tired treating them.
When the patient is lying on his stomach and you place your hand over the anus to try to stop it from coming out (the bowel movement). Then apply a point on the surface of the foot and do so with a pointed cautery to cauterize it if necessary (if bleeding occurs).
And then care for other hemorrhoids by curing them as well, if they are also sick.
Do not use this cautery method unless you have studied the art of medicine in depth and understand it well, otherwise you may cause harm to yourself or others.
[No text provided]
Bleeding control (bleeding stop).
You should apply the ancient cautery of phlebotomy to stop bleeding from this artery rupture. If you find a clot that is stuck in an artery, it may be necessary to cut through it as well, and remove it if possible.
You should submerge the object in oil and ignite it with a fire to cauterize that place between the fork of your arm and the neck; and also apply two cauteries near where there is a decline between the fifth rib and the chin, declining only slightly behind, and also apply two cauteries near where there is a decline between the fifth costal margin and the sternum. And also do a cautery on that place of the stomach, as well as one above it, and three cauteries in back from the spine; and another below the sternum, among two ribs of the breast, apply that cautery which is between two breasts.
When you have opened up space between the patient's thighs, placing cushions under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest holding their hands, here comes to apply the first cupping glass on the patient's back.
And they would apply the second glass in the same manner as those who do cupping to make it similar to ray and thus put that one into place between the shoulders, so that it may be applied from both sides simultaneously just as is said by the physician of medicine.
If this incision has been done properly and there is no fear that it will cause any harm to the place where the fistula occurs which cannot be healed
The end of the text
From the cupping procedure for the left arm.
When you cure the gout of the left arm in this way as we have said for its cure in division and do not observe your cure, then apply cupping in that limb using these two methods, which are correctives, one of them is to make three cups or four lines on the length of the arm according to the figure of the cups of the body, the figure of which precedes.
And in each cup make the diameter of one or two inches, and the hand movement of the cupping be the same as that which we have described for the cupping of the body.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Another method of cautery is to use a heated object, such as a hot iron or a cautery tool, which causes the vein in question at the muscle's origin to harden and contract, thus preventing dislocation.
Your elevation should go from the chest down towards the length of your body in order to place the cautery as close to its location as possible.
Place both hands on the patient's thighs between the two incisions, ensuring they are placed directly in front of the other incision.
Remove the cautery and apply four more cauteries.
If you want to use three points of cautery, cauterize at least three incisions.
Ensure that the previous cauteries are taken care of before using more cauteries to prevent complications in treatment.
Chapter 21
Cautery of dropsy.
Cauteries should not be performed in dropsy, unless specifically indicated by a doctor.
When curing dropsy using different methods of treatment that are not compatible with your care, the pain will come from four cauteries placed on the abdomen, a cautery over the stomach, another over the liver, and two between the shoulders, one at the right side of the chest, and another over the stomach. When making incisions for cauterization, the depth of the incision should be proportional to the urgency of the situation.
The cautery is being placed over the area in order to prevent the hand from coming out for a long time.
After making incisions, attach the intestines to the cautery with these stitches so that they are joined securely and the operation can begin.
The form of the cautery is like that used for cauterizing the belly but slightly different from its previous use and similar to the one previously used on the thighs.
Chapter 22.
Cauterization of the body parts and thighs.
When removing the stitches and applying new ones with water, make sure to cauterize the buttocks by between the ear and the nose, raising your hand over the cautery to prevent it from twisting away; then raise your hand again without returning the previous one that was used for strangling.
The second form of the cautery is as follows: And in each thigh there should be a cautery located at the cutting edge of it. The second form is that the length of each thigh should be taken into account, and put one cautery on top of the other at the joint point between the thighs; for both legs.
The first sentence translates to: "With a long time hold it in place, ensure that no water leaks out.
With the causes which have been mentioned
The next sentence is missing part of its text. I cannot complete it accurately without more information.
Cautery on the stomach
When the stomach is inflamed and humid, you should perform digestive and retentive cautery at the stomach. This is done in the stomach as well as the intestines, through a great cautery over it to follow after what has been done on the stomach, also the circle of Cauteries which are on the belly button, four Cauteries in the semicircle by the delicate veins, and Cauteries above the elbows around the thighs, or two Cauteries.
If times the humors are abundant and the patient is tolerant, then doctors perform a Cautery on the liver and the pancreas as well, and place two Cauteries over the stomach to control the digestive juices that may be excessive.
The next sentence is missing part of its text. I cannot complete it accurately without more information.
Cautery on ancient hemorrhoids.
When so is in the nature of ancient hemorrhoids or one with gross humors or corrupted humidities, and are treated as what has been mentioned earlier by division without conferring the same cure, doctors perform Cautery on three points on both sides of the buttocks which are small and triangular, and Cautery on each ombilicus through two cuts.
When the stomach of a patient is chilled and the vein of the patient is paralyzed, with the face of the patient turning pale, doctors apply a cautery over the stomach as a second one after it has been applied; they also have another cautery on his hand, and another above the belly of the patient at the elbow cautery. Let them leave this cautery open for some time, and apply medicine to him in order to heal him
Chapter 55
Cautery is applied over the abscesses
When you cut off an abscess, doctors remove the cautery that has been attached to it. When you cut off an abscess in the vein from which it came, finally remove both the cautery and the bandage that had been applied to the opening of that vein.
And if you apply it frequently and often, doctors burn each of them after a while, and treat these as they come to their wounds that are within the time for healing.
If you apply a large cautery on someone's arm, it may be more painful in youth.
Aor la cauzeria de las artels per a lor, e apuns l’artel de loa de la vena o l’arrel del cors am abietir cauteri, lor que fa que aquo faien, e la horaz de lor, e aprops la lor que son los.
First aid application on fistulas that are found in nature or on the body
When the patient refuses to comply with the recommendations given in this location, and is agitated by it, then do first aid application.
When there is any fistula in the natural course or after it has been established, then apply these remedies: cover them with something suitable to prevent further infection and ensure that you use a correct quantity of water according to the depth of the wound when applying this remedy.
Place the cautery in such a manner as it resembles a ray. Then apply that cautery to this fistula and follow the quantity mentioned on how you should apply it.
After using that cautery to burn off these ulcers or sores within a short time of one or two or three times depending on the quantity necessary based on your need.
Then, do not burn the nerves and veins unless it is on the bladder or bowels, in that case hold everything back from those areas; otherwise only apply when you know it's penetrating.
After doing first aid, then treat the area as needed.
If that location is sealed off and you have removed all materials from it for a long time, then the wounds will eventually heal completely on their own.
When there are no more causes to recall in their memory, they know that the disease has taken hold of them.
Chapter 77 of the Capitularies
Cautery on veins.
When pain occurs in the veins or due to great swelling, and it is desired by the patient that cautery be applied to each vein separately with a small cautery on each vein so as to remember which one was treated first.
And after the second one has been cautorized with a small amount of each, so that three cauteries will be applied in total and therefore may be the latest ones to recall first.
Chapter 88 of the Capitularies
Cautery on the bladder.
When it happens in the bladder with pain and softening due to swelling or humidity that the patient cannot hold their urine in, doctors cautorize there in a small space under the bladder itself near where they sit on the bench, and cautorize one above and another below as well.
The length of each cautery is determined by the amount of blood vessels to be treated, and if more than two veins need to be cautorized it will require as many cautories.
When joints are afflicted by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet
The next sentence to translate is "Sia cauteri clavilh segons que es processit.
Cautery for the artery
When veins in the artery become inflamed and infected, it is forbidden to treat them directly with cautery, so their membranes are damaged, and healing is delayed, and pain arises due to their obstruction; therefore, doctors customarily cauterize three times around the abdominal aorta as they do for the vesica's cautery, or two cauteries depending on the location, one cautery
The next sentence to translate is "E am cauteri sobre le loc pus dejos del dos, o am dos cauteris.
Cautery for the dislocation of the artery.
When the veins are inflamed and cause obstruction in the artery's location, causing inflammation at that point of the vein, it is customary to make prolonged stitches on the other vein when comparing them. The location for the dislocation will be noted here.
After you have cauterized the artery at the location of the vein as mentioned above, it is customary to wait until the pain subsides and then attempt to remove the obstruction by making a loop in the course of the artery so that its opening becomes aligned with the circle of the vein.
The cautery of which preceded the previous form in the stomach's cauterization.
If this cautery is not at hand, then doctors will cauterize three other cauteries instead of the missing one.
It should be applied to a specific quantity of the entire cord, and cure that which is healthy.
The end.
Cautery for sciatic vein
When pain occurs in the lower part of the thigh and it is caused by cold phlegm or moisture, then treat with that which you mentioned earlier and do not confer any other remedies, except for cautery.
There are two types of cauteries; one is cautery with medicinal ointments or cautery with fire.
The other one is cautery with three triangular cauteries in succession on this form; and apply it deeply. There are between each cautery the quantity of its breadth, whether a small one or a large one.
Sometimes you may need cauteries on both sides near the top of the thigh to be four cauteries.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and pain occurs in the feet, it is customary to call gout by doctors.
And if you want to cauterize around where the pain adheres to the anus and does not extend into the cavity, here comes the first sentence of how to do it:
And if the pain does not extend into the cavity, then doctors will use two points of cautery on both sides of where the patient feels the pain to prevent it from spreading further.
And if the cutaneous cautery is used and its depth depends on the amount of the skin's thickness needed to prevent it from spreading further.
And if the patient complains that pain extends to a location near their feet, doctors will cauterize there with three or four points of cautery depending on what is needed for that area.
And if the patient complains that the pain has spread to their buttocks, doctors will cauterize there with a cutaneous cautery.
And please remember that you will not use any cautery if nerves or great arteries are involved, and in this case your focus should be on the patient's location or contortion.
And you already inserted a cushion and another under the patient's thighs, in order to hold them down during the cautery, and place it on fire so that the tumor is completely burned through, while burning both hands and corrupted the whole foot. The most common solution for the bellyache was to let a fart pass, or else death would follow closely.
If pain occurs in two waves, cautery is applied to each wave separately.
The usual size of the cautery is that of a nail, and it should be placed so as to encircle the patient's hand completely.
These circles should be one after another. The space between them should equal the quantity of steps taken by the patient. And in these circles there should be two or three points, and place it at a distance so that it can be easily placed within the circles; this is how it must be done:
When fire has been placed on the patient's forehead and burns through to the eyebrows, then it should be placed over the side of the body affected by gout. Cautery is applied three times in a row.
Cautery is placed on the body for three days, over the affected part and applied until it becomes healed.

If bleeding occurs in a location that requires cautery with fire, the doctor will use sharp stakes to cut off the blood flow and then apply it later on.
Cautery should be used completely in order to stop all bleeding, without leaving any trace of its passage.
"After three days, place a cushion on the cauterized areas, and let them rest in a mixture of salt and vinegar until all sores are healed and all impurities have been removed.
Do you mean "cure" as in treating an illness or injury?
If after three days the skin becomes healthy without any impurities, then good is that; otherwise, put another cautery on the affected area to remove the impurity.
Do you mean "alchemy" as in a type of chemistry or do you mean "medicine"? Cautery is used to treat young people especially?
Do you mean "dosing" in the context of medicine or do you mean "division"?
Thank you!
Goodbye and good luck with your work!
Gout is a condition of the foot that causes big pain and swelling, often due to a buildup of fluids in the area?
Cautery is a treatment used in the case of gout, where pain occurs due to fluid buildup?
After pausing on the clot and applying pressure with your hand over the clot to stop it from spreading deeper? When this occurs for three days, it begins to hurt in the arm Then apply a poultice with salt and vinegar to that place for one night
Then cure the sore on the generated flesh
Then apply a poultice with cold water and wrap it in your hand, so that the poultice doesn't come out through the needle; then place your hand over the area to prevent the poultice from coming out; wait for one hour, remove it, as the cloth will be frozen on the affected part of the body.
Then take the other one and place it over all those parts that are injured in the chest.
Then cure these blisters on the nails as soon as they occur, by cutting them off the affected parts of the body.

Cautery for tremors.
When you have to cut through the nerve or cause fever in order to free it, or for any other similar reason, then doctors should cut into that with four incisions around its spine between each vertebra with one incision; and onto the stomach of him/her, onto the liver, onto the gallbladder.

Cautery on the abdomen for injuries
When a person's abdomen is opened for surgery, and pus fills the wounds that are formed with coarse corrupt materials; therefore at the beginning of the treatment, it should be cauterized over all parts of the incision using a subtile cautery device extending from the tip to the side; or by using a long needle, or lenticular cautery.
And when there is excessive bleeding after the operation of the second kind, and it is not controlled, then it should be cauterized with a breast milk adhesive to stop any excess fluids, and heal those.
May I add that this is done before the operation of evacuation through phlebotomy.

Cautery on the abdomen for injuries of the artery incision
Excessive bleeding from the artery incision which opens up the wound may require that sutures or cautery be applied to the member, and such cases are difficult to recover.
Therefore when such an event happens to you, put your hand on the wound of the artery, and hold it with a pointed cautery device so that no excess bleeding occurs from the injury itself, and prevents further bleeding.
When there are small ulcers in the lungs that have to be treated,
When the artery in that location is broken, you must carefully treat it with cautery to prevent any blood from flowing into the lungs and causing further damage.
If the artery is broken and you remove the cautery that was applied to it, then immediately apply another cautery over the other cauteries in the lungs, so as not to stop doing this until the artery has been healed.
Remember that you should not apply pressure here and also prevent any other harm or injury to the patient.
When the artery tears, it is not possible to restrict the tear further than you already have, and especially if it is a large one. If it involves both legs or arms, then stitches should be used in addition to cautery with fine needles that are placed carefully; or else it may cause too much pressure which could restrict the tear.
The doctor should administer a restriction that is not too strong and does not cause discomfort or strangulation, but rather to maintain it for some time so as to prevent the tear from reopening.
When a patient is on the table, and there is no doctor or medicine available, then the attendant will inform them to make sure that they are laying correctly in order for the treatment to begin as quickly as possible.
The incision, perforation, amputation, and phlebotomy are some of the procedures mentioned in this sentence.
In the first chapter of Al-Buhuti's book, you will find information about all forms of treatment for gout and the causes that lead to it, as well as the necessary instruments used in the procedures related to cautery; furthermore, the chapters on the abdomen are ordered from top to bottom.
You should proceed with this chapter in that manner so that all who seek such information can benefit from it.
And when you begin this chapter, son, let's learn that in this chapter is the science of cautery as presented in the first book on cautery
When making great caution, in the operation that is being described here, the evacuation of which is to be done by cutting open the vein or incision near the elbow or above the knee And with these symptoms accompanied by fear and trembling, it is most likely death that comes to mind
I must insist on you not to do this in the way it is described here, for some of the procedures may be dangerous and will harm your health And with this you go to attack your illness and it is necessary to seek help from a doctor, so as not to experience death by haste of the illness, and through fear of the illness, and through length of the illness, and in that illness there is sorrow which means death.
And from this comes to your mind that you have given birth and it has caused great harm, expecting in that illness recovery is impossible.
Then do not consent to that which comes before you from what is this madness; and your caution must be greater than covetousness and rapacity; and do not presume any cause for it but have certain knowledge of the kind which will verify this for you, and by means of success, a great praise.
In the care of all your ailments for prognosis and indication thereof to which you are converted in health that is to help you on acquisition fame and memory, praise and glory
Oh, children, please hear my words of wisdom and not be afraid to follow them or protect yourself because that is in your best interest
And you have ordered this chapter to follow the preceding chapters of cauteries and from care for the head down to the feet because it is in your best interest
The first chapter.
From the care of water which contains a head of children.
You know that this illness will go away from the children if they treat it and when the nurse comes to remove their head lice
And some are treated for a cause that is not known to be true
If you do not see this illness in the children, and for those who have seen it but will die from it, so are they in my view sickened by that.
You saw that one child's head which was full of water became magnificent in size compared to what could stop the sun from reaching if it were to burn it, and may humidity be only slight to avoid death by fire.
When the moisture or humidity is added between the knee and the ankle, or between the legs, it is added to cover the floor.
When performing the operation in such a situation where the moisture is between the knee and the ankle, or between the legs, doctors prescribe that you must make a small cut on your head at its latitude. And also note down the length of this cut to determine if it runs through the moisture, as that indicates the formation of a fistula.
And if the humidity is greatly increased and between the legs are more pronounced, doctors prescribe that there should be two cuts in this way.
And if the humidity is at the knee, as soon as it touches that place, your veins swell up and become inflamed when you come into contact with water on those parts of the body, do not worry about it. When you make a small cut on your head at its latitude and observe that there are two cuts in this way, doctors prescribe that...
The physician places incisions on the forehead, above and below them, and also at the back of the neck to relieve the heat and humidity, and to drain the fluids and cure the abscess that has formed there, and to cover the wound with a dry bandage to prevent infection while maintaining equal moisture in all parts.
When making an incision, consider the size of the opening and the flow of water: if any veins are dilated in the occipital or parietal region, it may occur on that side; to the right or left; hence, be attentive at the beginning when placing the aperture and the removal of the water, so as to ensure a second attempt is possible.
Be careful not to cut an artery and cause the patient unnecessary harm in that flow of blood as you remove moisture.
The third sentence translates to: "The second".
When you reach the back of the neck or chest area, and it is customary to do so in this manner without consulting a doctor for the care of those two arteries
Then you will cut into those that lead to the head and place it tightly against the chest area in order for them to be visible; and make sure not to miss any of them when they are about to be severed; and consider putting a vein over each of the locations where the arteries run, and so on
When the person is on their back
If you wish, remove the bandage and apply it to the wounds as quickly as possible
The length of the incision should be adjusted to two digits, as if a vein is injured there will likely be a pulsatile exit, indicating severe bleeding.
If the artery does not appear in the incision, doctors will assume you measured from the hairline to three fingertips, and place it now.
This is the quantity of blood you need to get rid of completely, and if it is not all, or only a part, this will be based on how much can be removed from both the patient's veins and arteries.
Then apply a bandage, but if there is any cause of bleeding, do not remove it to prevent further loss of blood.
Then apply the bandage securely over the patient's shoulders and limb dressings until they are stable.
And so on.
Remove all arteries that were in the temples.
When it comes to the head injuries that cause confusion or catatonia due to humidity and temperature fluctuations in temples, or if they are severe and resemble those seen here, doctors would remove the arteries from the temples by cautery as is done here.
The incision and extraction of the hernia are to be made in the temples, as well as understanding that this is done with great caution due to its sensitive nature
If the hernia is hidden and its location is uncertain, doctors may ask you to lubricate it with a cloth that dries quickly so they can clearly see if the incision has been made properly. The doctor will use this bandage in order for them Then, they will remove the bandage and examine it closely to check if the incision has been made properly; additionally, you should look for any signs of internal bleeding or other problems in the tunics as well.
If the artery is delicate, doctors will wrap it around the affected limb and check for signs of circulation after a certain time period to ensure that there are no wounds or abrasions elsewhere on the patient's extremities; otherwise they may cause damage to all of them.
Then remove it from the wound as quickly as possible within three days.
If the incision is large and you cannot use one of your hands to hold it steady or close to your body, doctors will recommend using both hands instead; otherwise, it could cause infection as well as damage blood circulation during the healing process.
When the excess fluid between two ligaments occurs; do this at that time or another time thereafter
If you want, cautery can be applied to the external hemorrhoids in order to stop them from bleeding; or alternatively, it can be used on that part of the body where they have occurred.
The best treatment is not to give the patient fever or hot baths because they can complicate a severe condition; instead, cautery should be applied to those causes that lead to final dryness of humors and it's most effective in youth
Apply cautery to the excrescences that grow from the surface of the flesh in order to stop them from bleeding; afterwards place a poultice on the affected area and apply warm compresses so as not to make things worse, lest they become infected with cold water.
If while you are dealing with any other external bleeding from the veins, you will also stop that bleeding; cautery can be applied to it or compress the area where it is located and tighten your hand so as not to let the bleeding go on. If the cause of that is not at hand, pause treatment on that area so as to allow the wound to heal; and afterwards, place a cloth soaked in very cold water over it, tightening it so as to stop the bleeding, while remaining second-in command.
"When you have opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion underneath them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest holding their hands, then comes here to cauterize that vein with this cautery.
This is how the cautery works
The sharpness of both needles varies. If the sharpness of both needles is similar, then puncturing each with one needle will not cause harm to the skin at high speed.
In such cases where there is some fat around it, you must apply heat from fire on that area and the flesh will be burned off gently.
This work is most effective in all works and easy to do.
The space between the two needles determines how much fat will be burned off.
The fourth part.
For the cure of the limbs, use sharp and strong needles.
When treating the limbs with acid needles and veins which are near to the crown of the head that do not interfere in this cause for medical treatment but times they cover and feel on their own front when walking as if it were the gait of fleas, and become exhausted from using them so often that their claws lose strength, and their fur becomes scaly due to the sharpness of the tears, are treated with this method in the cure of these veins, and it is performed.
"You command the patient to raise their arms so that they are in view from above, and then place incisions on both sides of the forehead at an equal distance as measured from the top of the head. "The length of the incision should be two fingers: one incision will extend from just below the nose to the end of the forehead, and the second slightly shorter, measuring about a finger's width away, for incisions on both sides of the tear ducts.
"And guard your hands from making incisions where the tears are located: on both sides of each eyelid. "The space between each incision should be three fingers wide.
"And if the skin is fragile or dry, apply a protective dressing to prevent cracking it further.
"Place two sharp instruments between your hands, which will be the form of the incision: "It's from the beginning of the temples to the second incision. "Cut the cord between those two incisions to the one that is above your eye, and place it into the second incision. "Place another tool called a cautery in the first incision, but not on both sides of it.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And if necessary to continue the incision at this point and close it in the crease of the arm.
You need to add more places for washing the hands.
And then apply a piece of cloth soaked in vinegar and oil over the poultice gently and repeatedly until it is completely absorbed into the poultice.
And in the third day remove the bandage and apply a generous amount of warm water or broth, and then wrap it around to heal the wounds.
Certainly.
From treatment of limbs and down towards the hands descending from the head parts.
When the arteries come to an end and continue, and if the patient's limbs become exhausted, and their hands are ulcerated, and in the forehead there is severe pain that radiates and extends downwards, the doctors understand that the materials and vessels of the limbs only bring blood from veins of the extremities.
"The first aid in this case is to command the patient to raise his head, and then make a small incision at the top of the forehead, just above it (and as you come from the left temple towards the right temple; and after that, make an incision through the nose; and elongate your hand from the temples to which the mastication must be done. And when the mouth is opened.
"After making a small incision at the top of the forehead, place two fingers on either side of it. "Then insert your thumb and forefinger into it carefully, so that you do not damage the patient's eye or nose.
"When you have finished this and see that the aperture has been reduced, then apply ointment made from two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophonia to it. And so if you take oatmeal made from two parts of bran and four parts of colophonia mixed with water, and place it in these patches on the native skin.
"Thank you very much.
"For the cure of this thing use the ears.
"The cause of this thing is one of four varieties: it may be mineral or similar to poison, or else it is plant-based, just like the venom from the bite of an adder or viper; or it can also be influenza, as with water and fever, or any other animal.
When any of the following causes are present that do not match those of the heart, and pause the chest if you wish; in case it comes up with a cause like this one, then treat it as stated above for gout. Pause the chest circulation of fats or fumes, and remove any excess fat that may be causing pain; if you wish to address these causes
If not, then treat it as stated above for gout.
Then, if you agree to do so and wish to continue; otherwise, treat it as stated above for gout.
Then, if you do not agree to proceed with this procedure, treat it as stated above for gout, using a needle and inserting the catheter into the arm vein in order to remove blood from the area while keeping the catheter at an angle that prevents both the needle and the catheter from being removed. Then, if you agree to proceed with this treatment, which is also recommended given your past experiences.
If you do not agree to proceed with this procedure, treat it as stated above for gout by placing a bandage over the affected area while ensuring that it remains still and stationary. With a cushion under their thighs, place another one on their legs, and yet another one on their chest, holding onto them with your hands.
And if it's found that there are several causes for the pain you mentioned earlier, then doctors will tend to recommend applying warmth or using a massage to alleviate the pains.
The method for doing this is to start by massaging the patient's superficial vein and extending it out of their second hand, then applying a cautery between your fingers and pressing gently on the surface of the foot below, making sure that no part of the intestine comes out through the small opening in the heel. If the tear of the lunar figure occurs in the foot itself and is not caused by a puncture wound that occurred earlier, then you would need to use an appropriate instrument for closing it; after applying this to close it quickly, ensuring its safety as well.
If the cause is found to be fat that has spread and infiltrated there, then doctors will administer treatment such as drainage or extraction of it. If you are unable to remove it yourself, they may recommend further care in this way: They will provide surgery to remove the fat that was found on their foot.
When joints are inflamed by the heat of fever, and pain occurs in the feet, then it is customary to call gout by doctors.
First the space between the patient's thighs is opened, a cushion placed beneath them, another on their legs and another over their chest, holding their hands And if it should happen that the water becomes heated through fever heat, then pain occurs in the feet.
And if it should happen that the water becomes heated through fever heat, then pain occurs in the feet. And if the water becomes heated through fever heat and it should happen that you run out of paper or cotton, then place one extremity on the abdomen and extend the other towards the flame to prevent injury to your hands.
And as the water becomes heated through fever heat and you run out of paper or cotton, then place another spoon against which to remove it from the patient's body.
And if the abscess comes out of that opening in the abdomen, as long as it is small enough, you should spread and press on it similarly to how one would squeeze a pimple from the body. But if the size causes swelling at the entrance of the body, doctors administer treatment for that too along with treating the abscess itself, because the cause could be more severe than all other reasons in the abdomen.
In the hollow of a newly born calf, when you cure that which I mentioned in division and treatise on distillation, do not expose it to direct sunlight.
And if there is here any cause of worms, remove that substance gently or delicately, unless there's a cause, use the long needle and this broad one which is like this: Insert the thin end into the calf's ear according to the amount necessary for healing, and apply it in a manner that is gentle but strong enough to kill all worms.
If it is not necessary to do so at that time, apply and wrap around the needle as described above; remove it in the treatise on distillation after it has been applied for treatment of worms.
And that your juice is what you use to heal the ear with this instrument which is like this: Use either silver or copper wire, thin enough, and tie it in a knot as described above.
And then it is necessary to apply it at the place where the needle of continence should be inserted, that is: "If you want, take the ray and insert it into the patient's abdomen gently, and put something in the hollow of their arm or a herb extract that you wish for these medicines to be given through this tube - that is within the ear canal.
"The one inside the ear canal has already been inserted with a small incision made in its focus. "Remember that if the cause of what is to be drawn from within the ear canal is too deep, then the medicines in the ear canal may not work.
I am unable to translate this as it appears to be a mistake or an incomplete sentence.
"Regarding the insertion of tubes into the ear canal.
"The insertion of tubes into the ear canal should be done with caution in order to avoid perforating the drum or soft tissues. In case there is a perforation caused by inserting the tube through flesh instead of cartilage, that incision should only occur at the point where it was intended - and any other incisions made elsewhere are unnecessary.
"In case of perforation in this location which is not understood by the patient, it requires more difficult and challenging surgery.
In that case where you find a moment to pause the patient's arm outside in the sunlight and keep watch over it there And if such an opening appears suddenly, do this method which is most subtle, that is how to proceed
If the limb for which this is done has a small latitude, that one part of it being sharp and the other not; and if its surface is of two lengths such that it does not cause injury to the arm.
And if the opening is done through naked flesh on the arm or on the body of the patient, then you perform this most subtle incision and quickly make it so that all the flesh has been opened up.
And if it is done on the front of the arm, then you take a small piece and fasten that to the body of the arm.
And if the opening is done in such a way that the patient cannot easily bear it due to great pain caused by its use, force the release of this from the body gently; and remember not to harm any nerves on the arm.
And after it has been wrapped tightly around the arm as you would in Egypt's way of binding, wait for several days to ensure that the bandage is secure; or if needed apply another bandage over this one and smooth out any wrinkles on it, and use a sharp implement like a knife to cut through it, but do not tear anything. And after you have wrapped tightly around the arm as you would in Egypt's way of binding, wait for several days to ensure that the bandage is secure; or if needed apply another bandage over this one and smooth out any wrinkles on it, and use a sharp implement like a knife to cut through it, but do not tear anything.
When a flux of sin arises, the pains are poured over or laid on linen and water, above the navel, while another servant holds it back with care to prevent its flow, as is mentioned in the treatise on distillation
This sentence seems incomplete without more information about what "sanc" refers to. Is there anything else you know that could help me understand?
In order to cure the illness of which eye, it is necessary to apply a poultice made from the aforementioned substance.
The illness in question affects only one eye and does not spread to other parts of the body
Then put it as you would onto a clean cloth and gently apply it to the affected parts of their face, and place your hand over them to prevent any further scratching.
If pain arises from the flow of the blood, then you should burnish with a subtle lancet these parts that are affected.
The preferred cautery is to apply it in the creases and folds of the affected areas, where it will remain until all signs of inflammation have disappeared completely, at which point the affected parts will burn up and not reappear.

When the pain is so great in the palms of the hands that it seems to increase strength and hardness, then it is called gout.
This means "when there's a swelling of large moisture on the eyelid.
In this case, the doctor's action is to check if it comes from the hand and is accompanied by swelling throughout the whole area of the palm, which may indicate gout as a cause.
"Then fasten that opening onto the lateral area and then close it gently to facilitate its closure, preventing any loss of blood.
If the figure is large, tighten that opening up to ensure it is healed.
"If there's not much, you won't do any harm by restoring and closing it.
"If the swelling is diminishing from the palms of the hand then you remove that opening and gently close it, leaving some room for insertion if necessary, otherwise press it all down to ensure its closure, but if it's already closed and the hand is swollen in this way, there's no cause.
The first sentence translates to: Begin by washing his hands with salty water, then treat the location where the ailment has occurred as best you can for health's sake.
This appears to be a request for clarification or correction of a previous statement made in the text above that I cannot identify without more context. Could you please provide more information about what needs to be corrected?
The sentence "Cura le loc am aquo que encarna entro que sia sanat" may need a correction in the phrase following it, which is "axcirnah.
The corrected sentence is as follows: "E grays le qual es engendrat en las tunicas de la palpebra desus, e majorment endeve als enfantz, agrava les huels de aquels et accideyso a lor catartz le mayti; e no podon reguardar la claror del soleilh per aquo quar lagremas se coytan ad aquels.
This sentence translates to: "And because of the times that these sores appear on their cheeks when they are awake and on their eyelids while they sleep, as well as the tears from those with wet eyelids caused by the inflammation, which have already been treated with a cautery and there is an imminent danger of recurrence in them; and whenever you apply lotion to the affected areas you'll feel a burning sensation inside them.
This sentence translates to: "No matter how many times you operate on the patient who stops bleeding from the top of their head with a cloth and then applies it wet over them, then circles second around the amount which contains all the parts, and then places it above that one and presses against the entire area in order for it to be tightened up into a circle, if there is no moisture on the outside surface of the wound when you perform this procedure, because there may not have been enough time spent on the application.
"You should be careful when inserting needles into the patient's abdomen, as punctures may occur on a hernia.
"Take care while wrapping the bandage around your right and left thighs, being careful not to twist it between the legs, so that it is properly positioned.
"Remember to keep the incision clean in order to prevent infection and heal well.
"Make sure not to apply pressure on the incision site immediately after making it, and adjust your bandage slightly so as to avoid irritation of the wound; and do wrap it tightly with soft cloth, adding water and gauze over it to keep it clean.
"And remember to keep the bandage moist around the incision site in order to prevent dryness and heal well.
"Take care of it until it heals.
"If anything happens to the wound and you're in a hurry, treat it with haste while seeking medical attention.

"When the eyelids swell up due to inflammation and itching, doctors usually apply natural remedies or use old techniques such as cautery. The cause of this is called blepharitis, and it can be cured in four ways: by burning with fire; applying acute medicine according to what was described in the capital of cautery; doing surgery; or by using a hook.
"You should now put the finger of the right hand on the forehead of the patient and, if possible, convert it to pierce through, otherwise you must insert an iron needle into that part where it was faithfully removed from the eyelid, and proceed as follows.
"Next you should put the finger of your left hand into the upper eyelid and stretch it towards the inner corner of the eye; then remove the finger and sprinkle the eyelid with water or wipe it clean.
"However, please note that this measure may vary depending on the height of the eyelid as it differs among people, so those who have a more delicate eyelid should be cautious when using these methods.
"Next put your finger on the lower eyelids where you made incisions earlier and proceed from the inner corner of one eye to the other. "If there is a natural furrow at that point, it should be as smooth as possible in order for it to heal correctly.
"Next, put one of your fingers in the corner and make sure it is clean; then gently draw back its nail to avoid tearing the delicate skin around the eye or eyebrow.
When the intestines are opened for three days or four, it should be treated right away
If you want to close the opening in the intestines and restore fluids, you should seal it with a stitch and then apply pressure on both sides, as closing it will heal better than doing nothing at all, especially if done quickly after the onset of symptoms
The treatment may seem severe but is a good operation and should not be feared.
Then the opening should be closed as quickly as possible, and apply pressure on both sides to seal it in this manner.
If it's not possible to close it immediately or if the closure is not successful, doctors will insert a needle with a filament and put it into the eye socket of the affected side, then place another finger on the outside corner of that same eye so as to apply pressure evenly across both sides.
Then firmly grasp both lips of the opening and sew it closed, making sure it is sealed completely.
If you have cuts or wounds that need to be treated, seal them with sutures and clean the area around it carefully, being sure not to contaminate it.
"First servant, open the space between their thighs and place a cushion underneath them.
"Second servant, perform this action next: "Second servant, open the eyelid and make a slit in the shape described second, so that it extends from the edge of the eyelid to the edge of the pupil. Also place two thin strips below which run parallel to each other and at an angle equal to half the length of the eyelid divided by twice the height of the pupil. "You have already opened the space between their thighs, place one hand in each of their hands.
"In the meantime, tighten each of their fingers as much as possible and place them on top of the slit in the eyelid, making sure to keep them in place for as long as necessary.
"If it is late, stop applying heat and take care to cover the wound with something clean.

When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Do not apply heat to the affected area if it is painful or inflamed.
When the swelling is natural and hard or sharp, avoid piercing it with a needle in that spot; instead gently press down on that area and apply heat to help reduce inflammation, making sure not to use excessive pressure as this could cause damage. The length of the foot is equivalent to the width of a palm.

Then slowly raise his head up into the air while pronouncing your declaration clearly and distinctly, for this is a delicate operation that requires great care and attention to detail.
Then gently insert the needle into the affected part of the skin, adjusting it so that it enters the eye only very slightly and does not penetrate beyond the natural tear film.
Then gradually remove the skin from above as you insert it into that area gently and smoothly until the skin is removed in one or two or three pieces without leaving any excess.
Then carefully take your hand away from above as you remove the skin gently and smoothly until it is removed from around the eye into the natural tear film.
"When the veins swell and are painful in the patient's feet, it is customary to apply poultice on the affected parts.
"The poultice will be applied to the swelling and painful veins; it should be kept on for two or three days, until the wound becomes covered with good healthy skin.
"If the poultice is too tight or painful to apply directly on the patient's skin, adjust a natural furrow of hair and lift it up; do this gently, so that it will stay in place until the wound becomes covered with good healthy skin.
"After healing...
"From the cure of the last eye infection that was cured...
"When the eye is infected and becomes swollen or contorted on one side of the face, either left or right, due to improper closure of the eyelid or suture, it is called an epiphora; this may be accidental or intentional, depending on whether it was caused by improper closure or sutures.
"The surgeon should make an incision between the two eyelids and separate them so that there is a space to place a dressing over; then close it as soon as possible after healing has occurred.

"The accidental operation may be done by stabbing or incision or cautery or any other means.
"The way of performing the operation is that you take a needle with which make two passes and place it in the skin and let it pass from the inner to the outer part of the eye.
The first sentence translates to "Open up the space on either side of the patient's chest. "After you have returned the eyelid figure as described above, if it is so, then close [the split] eyelid and make two slits in its lower part.
"The two slits should be made at the corners of the eyelid, which will allow them to enter when they align together.
The Greek letter for "eye" is lambda (Λ).
"Take the amount of skin from between their eyebrows to make a slit in it.
"Adjust the separated parts and cover them with a piece of woolen cloth, and also apply the soothing medicines mentioned earlier to ensure they are all in order.
"If it is necessary to perform a slit or incision with a cautery, then you should make the slit flat on top of their eyebrows as described. "Then adjust the gap between the two lips as mentioned earlier.
"In the context of performing a cautery when they are ready or needed for surgery, after it is prepared in the manner described earlier and that shape varies.
When joints become inflamed and filled with cold humors, they can cause pain throughout the body including in the feet, it is customary to call this gout by doctors.
And if necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery
From adhering to the eyelid to the conjunctiva or the cornea.
When adhesions occur in the eyelid causing it to become solid and unable to move freely due to a restriction of natural movements, then you must remove that extra bit from under the lid, lift it up or extend it along its edge.
And if the adhesions are in a very subtle place where incisions cannot be made without causing additional damage to the eyelid itself, then you must remove that small piece so that the patient is not overly concerned about the operation and retract it away from the edge of the eyelid.
And that incision should be made in such a way as to allow the adhesion to return to its normal state and to be completely healed.
And when putting in a salted water that you wash with, or distill it of the impurities from alcohol.
And if necessary to separate the eyelid from the eyelashes by pulling them apart and placing a wet towel over the eye in order to absorb any remaining liquid or impurities after shaving it free of hair.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
With incision wounds and the emission of blood from tears.
It is the second of two veins, one nervous and one not-nervous; like a subtle cephale or a cold white humidity which when touched either way, is free from taking effect, it is obstructed and does not take place in that vein.
The eyelids do not communicate but with the tear duct which goes little by little towards covering the eye and prevents it from moving.
The vein of the work in the incision is that the patient's head should be placed towards it, and the hands are placed there, and raise the eyelid with your hand, and close them a few times to extend that to the edges of the wound. You take one needle and insert it in the navel or beneath the arm pit, or between the shoulder blades, or diagonally to the side of the abdomen, double up the needle little by little until it reaches at the edge of the wound, and inserts into the needle, and holds close the eyelid; and prolongs that with many folds, and releases from the hair on the edge of the eye which is the pupil. When joint pain occurs due to cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, it is customary for doctors to call this gout.
You should gently massage the eyelid area with a small brush or sponge to help remove any remaining mucus that may continue to flow from the glands continuously
If you find yourself in a situation where the surface of the eyelid is already swollen or inflamed as mentioned earlier, and if it is necessary to remove it completely by using a sharp instrument like a scalpel, then this would be the method used to do so.
Remember not to touch the cornea and cause injury or rupture it, as that could result in a perforated pupil.
After the incision has been made with a small amount of salt water or saline solution, let it sit for a moment and then gently wash it off in another bowl, and afterwards care for that area as if it were injured.
If the eyelid is not swollen and you are unable to thread a needle through it without tearing or puncturing it, then doctors will treat this specific type of eyelid injury by medication, and it would be advisable to consult an ophthalmologist for further treatment.
If you wish to perform this procedure, then first remove the gauze pad and gently squeeze out excess fluid with a soft cloth as described earlier. subtlety If the aforementioned is rarefied and confused when engaged in that manner, then pain is caused by cold air or dampness infiltrating into it to cause such pain.
Then apply ointment on top of that to heal it, unless the contrary is proven by a doctor's order, in which case he should immediately treat as if it were a wound.
Then do apply treatment to that part to make it healthy again.
The emission of tears is when the tear ducts become blocked and inflamed; if it occurs frequently and persists without improvement or cure, that condition should be examined closely for other causes to prevent further eye damage.
Then distill into the tear ducts air or dampness to cause such pain.
Chapter XVII.
On the incision of a gallbladder and that which is born in the liver.
Any veins in the hands that are born with rough skin and over-raised will cause pain when pressing on the eyes, close them or press against the cheeks to raise their eyebrows.
The operation on him is to pause the head in the tie and fix his eyes closed as much as possible; then apply ointment onto that part of his body according to what works best for him at this time, either with a forceps or a needle; after that start treating the skin from there until everything has been finished by making incisions.
When the incision is made according to which method we recommend in the previous chapter or fashion of the wound, after it has been applied, you will come.
After completing the incision and removing all of that flesh, pour hot oil on it or distillate in alcohol to cover it with corrosive medicines, and then apply a pointed cautery.
If there is no cause for the cautery to be used and you are afraid of pain from the cautery, then apply a pointed cautery on it while covering that with this procedure so as to prevent that from happening again, and do similarly in the adjusted flesh which causes the pains in the oil.
Please do not remove all care from the wound either naturally or accidentally, otherwise you may miss that part of it which was operated on.
Chapter eighteen
The collection of salt to put on the oil.
Sabel should be poured over it and prohibited from that procedure, to prevent the oil from becoming rancid or spoiling the operation, and remove it after days of use.
Therefore, you should initially consider whether the oil in which salt is used is good and not another type of poison that may harm it, and then apply the salt to it.
And you command the patient to hold his head in such a way that it is at rest and let one or both of these veins be stretched.
And if two are held tightly, have them gently moved apart in this manner
And if the two veins are stretched with great force and subtlety, stretch them gently but firmly, and take away at once those that are being obstructed or blocked, so they may be relaxed.
And be sure not to hold the hands of the patient's feet while performing this operation on their abdomen if it is being done in broad daylight; and make your movements firm but without cutting off circulation, so that veins may remain intact.
When you are done, apply something cold or hot to prevent any further erosion of this area that has been cut open.
If it is not possible to attend to the patient at that moment, and if there are still pains from them, then you should leave this care for a certain number of days until the pain subsides and it has been ensured that the cauterization will heal properly.
And when returning to attend him, make sure there is no further bleeding from this procedure.
This is how the operation should be performed:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
When you cure joints with cautery or acute medicine after the account is given and it is not a secret remedy, then the sores are opened in the same way as before to extract all of the moisture which is within them by the nose.
And when it is discovered that there is corruption or blackening in it, then you should apply a treatment of which type this way:
It is called "the quick and easy way," and it consists of placing a poultice on it, then applying heat, or alternately by puncturing with the sharp point of a needle or applying a subtle puncture.
And if you find it necessary to make the poultice between the toes and press your hand gently bit by bit until you know that this corruption is cured.
And if it is necessary to make poultices with damp and hot compresses.
If the spot is healed and is in good skin and has been removed from the body by washing it with water for 10 days, without healing or being applied ointment, nothing happens to him accidentally, then you know that he is cured.
When the fissure is not in the nose but rather on the face and its severity increases, then you should make incisions and it is customary that doctors prescribe acute treatment or medicine.
If the tear is triangular-shaped, first extend your fist towards it as often as you can be.
Then place your hand over the eye and on the eyebrow; and put a little of it into your hand, and remove your hand from above to prevent entering into both eyes, that is where you should hold your hand.
Then the doctors restore the location with strict medication and it must be done as often as possible.
Then with the material that it filled in the parts of the body return to the nose; then put it over the patient's head.
This is a translation error and there are no further translations available for this line
Reduction of the prominence of the nose.
When the nose becomes prominent and does not occur in any other way than a slight increase or decrease in size but is generally constant, it is customary that doctors prescribe laxatives, and put their hand over them, and place your hand above to prevent the mucus from escaping through the throat and falling into the chest; and then rest on the nose ointment that contains acacia, aloe, and sandalwood.
"The doctor's assistant rolls a bandage over the patient's mouth to cover their tongue.
"The servant places one more on top of the other, according to how much is needed for treatment. "The servant tightens the bandage tightly to prevent strangulation, and afterwards applies a poultice of warm water or oil to soothe the pain.
"If meanwhile the ligament is softened by alcohol application, then loosen it after treatment.
"The servant applies the ligature as described above.
"If pain occurs after treatment, then the servant applies a poultice of warm water or oil to soothe the pain.
"The end of this medical treatise.
"From the beginning of this medical treatise.
"When the rupture occurs in the tunic, and it is evident and clear to see this way of doing things, one does this operation as described above; inserting the needle at the point where the tear ends, and holding it tight.
When you have placed a cushion under their thighs, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest holding them by the hands, then insert a needle into the vein infused with alcohol in order to draw out the phlegm as it may happen that the thread will come out along with the phlegm.
And then apply a cold compress over this area, which should be healed.
And place the rags soaked in cold water around this area with great intensity of wetness, and pierce a small hole that will allow the phlegm to escape, then run cool water over it and inside as well.
And continue doing so until they are healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of cataracts.
The ailment called cataract is nothing more than a swelling that can be treated with cool water and not by this one.
The procedure of the work is that you should pour water on their face and put it in a cool position for them to drink from your two cups placed there by doing this, avoiding it going down unless necessary, holding its head so that it sees the remedy coming, and then after applying it, do not descend but remain still.
And if you will not come down from above, you know what water is.
When the descent to the abdomen is prepared as we have said, the gout will be removed between your thighs and gently applied to a small piece of cotton over the abdominal skin in order to prevent the discharge from continuing onto the conjunctiva or cornea of the eye (insert location).
Once it is done, the gout will be distilled in a liquid containing salt or sugar, which you have mixed with vinegar and water.
And then take care of all other causes that may exist
Chapter 22
From the treatment of the gout descending from the urine.
You have specified in the division where to make a hole for declaring that this is done for the health's sake.
The gout will be removed between your thighs on a flat surface and its urine will drain well through it, the strictness of which you should know.
Place your right hand on the eye's eyelid if its urine is the left one, or on the left hand if it is the right one.
Place your right hand on the top of the stomach if its urine is the left one, or on the left side if it is the right one.
When the patient's abdomen is to be touched at its lower edge near the eyebrow and on the surface of the tear duct in the lobe of the eyelid, approach gently with your hand towards it.
If you suspect that the pain is due to an abscessed liver or gallbladder, approach very gently and ask if it has already burst open.
Approach the pupil at its lower edge towards the measurement of the space that is found between the iris and the limbus, which includes the eyelid's margin; when you are approaching this pupil from within the eye for clarity in the corneal epithelium.
Approach the patient with water, gently place your hand on their shoulder a short distance away, and if they complain of vision problems as well, ask about any other pain that may be affecting their sight as well, such as the gallbladder.
After a short pause, if it is determined that water has been applied and the patient still complains of pain after applying another hand over their shoulder gently but firmly, ask about any other pains they may be experiencing as well, such as abdominal pain.
When it has been determined that the water is still causing pain and not receding, ask for the patient to gently stretch their abdomen, approach with one hand at a time towards it, and place your hand over the ear as well; then wash thoroughly the eye with clear salt solution to remove any infection or irritation from the cornea.
In our time, it's customary that when someone has eaten a meal rich in purine from an album of food,
When a person becomes obese and suffers from excessive hunger - which is the case of many men for whom this happens to be true - doctors recommend that they consume food in moderation.
And when it comes to joints, and not the extremities of your hand or foot, do consume food in moderation.
Once you've eaten something that has been mentioned earlier.
You must give the patient's order to remain still on their back with a soft cushion between them and their feet, and strictly forbid any movements.
Pausing in nature of it to allow its nature to be quiet and not encourage any movement towards the right or left side either up or down.
And for those who's disposition is within three days
And place them in a very dark and quiet room, and ask for causes of their pain, and return the order within seven days.
Do not do this during or just before feeding. Be careful when you remove it, because water can flow violently and heavily from the wound.
When a gout attack occurs in the morning or evening, they say that it is caused by cold humors and ask for treatment right away to stop the pain from spreading through the day/night.
It is customary to remove the bandage from their face and cover it with a cloth or something similar in order for them not to see the blisters that may appear over time on those days
This sentence suggests that the doctor should investigate the cause of gout as quickly as possible, asking questions and seeking answers accordingly.
They say that one should not excuse a disciple who has been caught looking at certain forbidden fruits, and they ask the doctor to inquire into their operation as well
They mention that they have been to the doctor who performs acupuncture, and they say it is important to note down when the needle was inserted into the arm.
Although it is true that this may not happen in our land as we know it, or be done according to the old ways of free people, but it could still be a new thing.
This is how the methods used by magicians are performed in order for them to control those things that you don't know about:
It may be necessary to have an acute point at the end of this line as well as another way that is more subtle and triangular-shaped, using one's hand or something similar.

From the care of flesh none in the nose
When the flesh in the nose becomes infected with various adjusted worms of which no cause is the assembly scorpion or polyps, and this disease is called polyps, because it resembles the appearance of that worm represented. From which flesh becomes cancerous, it turns pale, and from it is that flesh becomes white
Then in the case where those worms are neither fraudulent nor cancerous, make a space for the patient between your legs and expose them to sunlight, spread their excrement on the nose of him, and sprinkle salt over it in order to heal the sores on those worms. And with the aid of that subtle instrument which you have comprehended from these fine parts of the one opening through which it is clear to you that all flesh has been opened, if any cause arises for whose removal is possible, the doctors are advised in this case to take advantage of a simple means to facilitate the movement of this cause. If the sore is caused by cold or hot sores, the doctors are advised to pause there and cleanse it with a cautery; if it is from malignant sores, they are advised to burn away all the cavities that have been opened.
When you have opened up space between the patient's thighs, place a cushion underneath them, another servant on their legs, and yet another one on their chest while holding onto their hands. The mouth is open and the servant approaches to moisturize it with water or wine.
If the moisture doesn't penetrate when it is moistened because of a blockage, then you know that he has a blocked nose and his nasal passages are inflamed in those areas where they have not been obstructed.
Then you know to introduce it gently into the nostril where there is no obstruction, and place your hand between each nostril counting the quantity of that one or another, and insert them gently in the nostrils due to any reason which may be possible.
You know to make them inhale the smell through their nostrils, and be sure it reaches into their throat so that they will vomit what is there when they have eaten too much of this remedy which causes children in schools to do this action.
Then pause the two fingers from one hand, and place another finger into their nostril which is towards the nose, and insert it gently in the nostrils as well, knowing that the flesh has already become moist with the nose of the person.
When the body part is first exposed by a cautery, place a cushion under it and put another one on its chest to prevent injury during this procedure that lasts for three days or more until all wounds related to the foot have healed
When the cause is over, place a needle filled with poison in its nose for three days or more until it's cured.
If there were no curative measures available at that time, then use this one.
This is the form of the instrument used to open up and drain any fluid or medicine from inside.
If it is filled with silver or other metals that resemble a small vessel of goldsmith's work, and has the same shape as such an object.
If you wish to use a closed cautery as well with the needle, and place the instrument in such a way that it is flat on top, uncovered; having its muzzle at the lower part of it, through which you will draw out what you want from the juice or causes of bleeding.

Joint pain caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, including the nose and lips and the chin when continuity is dissolved through either plague or through laughter
"When solving the problem of continuity in one of these vessels, please refer to that operation instead of this one.
"Then go ahead and if it is fresh blood in the vein, adjust the two lips of the plague by the incision, and apply a cold compress to that affected area.
"If the lips of solution to continuity are already separated and each is healthy, then you should remove one piece from its cavity as soon as possible. "Then adjust the two lips by incision and stretch them tightly, and place a compress of dragon's blood on them and wrap it around each in a strip like bandage, then lay that over another of those consolidated plasters or similar, and let it stay for 2 days or three, and remove it and exchange it with another one, and let it stay there to prevent any escape, and apply it over the affected area as soon as possible.
"The remedy of the incision is that you apply the solution to continuity or with needles as recommended for abdominal surgery, or add the solution to continuity if it has already been applied in this manner and you know.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors
The reasons for the pains that come from the toes on the steps of the house
These reasons are considered very harsh and severe on the feet, as well as some others that are softer and more mild.
To prevent these harsh wounds from spreading throughout the whole part of the body and to clean up any injuries that may have occurred during this process, it is customary for you to wash the area with warm water and then dry it thoroughly before sealing it.
Here comes the next sentence to translate. Do not add any comments, like "here is the translation", just reply with the guessed translation and nothing else:
To sew up the skin on the lips.
You should stretch the skin on the lips over the upper teeth and close it with your lower lip or fasten it between your teeth, making sure to leave a small opening so that saliva can flow through easily.
After sealing up the wound, you should place a soft or absorbent material on it in order for it to absorb any pus or other substances that may have flowed through during the process.
If the skin returns after being sealed up, then you should cut it open again and apply a cautery to seal it once more, as the cautery will not return.
When severe joint pain is caused by cold humors that spread through each part of the body, and especially if it happens in the feet, doctors customarily call it gout.
The reason for doing this is unknown, but please continue with the next line anyway:
When the gums around the teeth and between the front teeth are tightly pressed together and covered in blisters, it is customary to call this condition canker sores.
And if you place the patient between your breasts and hold his head in its position so that it cannot move, but the teeth are in the gums where these blisters and causes seem to be going into them because of some cause, and this is due to blackness and citrininity and other things being mixed together, then they are considered as a mixed infection.
If this is where the reason begins, then good luck! But if not, you should go back to the previous day and the second one after that until tomorrow.
You know that teeth may need different treatments depending on how they are prepared for your surgery. To ensure that the reason is prepared for when the tooth comes out of its socket and another for when it is removed between teeth.
"When joints are affected by cold humors that permeate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet.
"Remove them if necessary
"Treat the cause of pain by removing it if possible and prevent any further causes arising from its removal.
"Make sure to remove the affected part if possible and make it clear that this is a gout pain caused by cold humors so that future pains do not occur in the same area.
"If it is necessary to remove the affected area, you should do so in stages from the outermost edge of the tooth inwards towards the center.
"Take great care when making a large opening or causing a fracture in it, and put the top of your hand over the patient's head to prevent injury from being done.
"If not possible to remove it directly, you should take one of these instruments and put it at the very tip so that you can easily feel around inside.
When the tooth is decayed or perforated, doctors recommend covering it with a dressing and keeping it covered to prevent infection at that location until the next check-up time approaches when you can examine it more closely
Doctors recommend covering the entire length of your gumline and be sure not to touch it until you are certain that it is completely healed, as returning to it prematurely may exacerbate the first pain of recovery
Doctors advise against allowing ignorant barbers or others to perform a suction excision without proper training and expertise as they may find it difficult and may cause complications, especially when attempting to remove cysts from the eyelid or other such areas.
The excision should be performed by a qualified professional in a controlled manner using caution or scissors
If there is bleeding or injury from this procedure, then proceed with caution and apply pressure to the wound if necessary, using a cautery if bleeding continues.
Use the forceps carefully starting from the longer end outward to prevent injury during use.
When you first open a door to enter into that which has been sealed up until now, it will be opened with great ease

The procedure to open the mouth and loosen the jaws of a person whose jaw has been locked up tight
When you need to loosen the jaw that has been locked up tight for no particular reason, do this. Place your hand gently or with a pair of tweezers on the area around the mouth so as to make it soft over one or two days until the place is softened; and then apply a small piece of flesh between the lips by way of forceps:
These procedures should be used in the same way as before, either gently or with tweezers.
If you do not have the forceps or tweezers available, then hold your hand steady and bring out the instrument by which this operation is known as such, a small one with a form like that.
"The extremity should be large but not too big to prevent it from being cramped.
"If the issue is as described, then proceed. If not, use this other tool which has these forms: the form of the first tool is a triangular extremity with some thickness.

"Use this tool with two ramps, where the following shape is correct: "Use this tool for shaving with razors. Originally it was assembled into one large piece, and the shape is:
The triangular extremity should be long or short but never too thick to prevent it from being cramped.
"Other tools for shaving your face are similar, just not razors.
"The subtle art of shaving and the different types of cuts mean that other tools are needed to perform these various operations on the face which previous instruments could not handle or predict.

Care for teeth is important above all else.
When teeth are important enough to override natural functions of those teeth the way they were meant to be used, and more so when there is an issue with the front or back teeth, as well as with the bottom lip; it means that you should consider removing them both if one cannot be saved, unless otherwise instructed by a doctor. It's important not to remove any other tooth without consulting this instrument which identifies whether they can be removed at all.
And if the incision is made in such a way as to save that tooth for many days due to its importance and not another one's, it means
And if the prominent tooth is lost in battle, the doctor will sew that back on by using this instrument which identifies whether it can be put back at all.
When the first tooth is extracted due to pain and swelling of the gums near where it was extracted from, there will be little or no other teeth like it in motion days that follow, for fear that another tooth may come out as well. Then return the intestines to their cavity and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
If the tongue is injured and torn off its root, then place it back in place so that it does not fall out or get damaged due to speaking.
The thirty-third chapter of Capitulum
To restore a missing tooth with gold or silver.
When an injury occurs on a tooth due to concussion or bruising from impact, and the patient cannot withstand it anymore, you should seek immediate medical attention, as your care was not taken properly, so that they may not lose their wisdom teeth made of gold but not silver, because silver may break easily.
The manner in which to restore the missing tooth is by placing it between two healthy teeth, and cutting it so that half of its length lies between them; or if there are only one or three parts, then you should place the fabric over both of the teeth on the side where the other part is. The first sentence in English is "You have already prepared the space between their thighs...
"...and strained your hand to facilitate and ensure it does not cause harm.
"Add those in any location you choose, and close them between the healthy tooth and the one that is damaged to ensure there's no injury to the tongue. "...and straighten it as before with a Roman.
"If the patient is on their side or stomach, keep them in place and support them gently to prevent any harm coming from a change of position.
"...this is the shape of the teeth and figure for two healthy teeth and two damaged ones, like this...
"When returning a tooth or two to their place in these locations, it is recommended that you use the same way and remove them.
"This isn't just any tool; it serves a purpose.
"Some vegetables are good for cow bones and it's used in the same way as a tooth, with its surface smoothened off at an angle to prevent slipping of the tooth, and tightened like that which was mentioned earlier.
The passage describes a method for treating various medical conditions using cautery points on specific parts of the body in order to prevent them from causing pain or damage when they occur.
To slit an ulcer that is located in the tongue and prohibit it speaking.
The ligament of which part of the body can cause some swelling or is normally found in that part where people speak, or accidentally occur due to a previous solidification.
The operation is to remove the tongue of the patient from its place and elevate it, so that the nerve ligament is cut after a certain length has been reached which can be solved by the tip of the tongue touching the palate of his reception.
If there is no pain or injury and it was only meant for the formation of fluid, then you should cut through the ligament at that point where you first cut through it in order to dissolve the knot.
And remember not to make a tear in his forehead, and that you will cause bleeding if you split through here.
And make sure that the vestige of the incision is covered or wet, and pause from allowing the tongue to lick it; otherwise, make sure that the tongue does not become solidified or swollen in any way.
If bleeding occurs, put a bandage over the bruised area; if an injury is about to occur, then burn it with cautery points in order for that to happen. When health fails due to the presence of certain causes between the thighs, this ailment becomes gout.
Chapter fifty-five
You remove a bandage from your tongue.
Some of the symptoms that happen to you when your tongue is bandaged are: it becomes swollen, and it hurts due to being pushed away from its normal position inside your mouth.
The operation involves holding the patient's mouth open for several minutes, and considering a bandage placed over it.
If you notice that the color or blackness of your feet becomes painful and unbearable to bear without causing pain in others nearby, then stop doing so immediately.
If the whiteness of your feet becomes damp and uncomfortable to handle, then you must soak them in something warm; and if they start to swell during the operation time, stop using any sharp objects that may cause further swelling; this is very dangerous as it restricts blood flow
Return to your work and try various remedies such as water, salt, and vinegar. If this does not help for the health of the foot itself, then proceed with other solutions.
Chapter sixty
You remove the bandage from both thighs and also from any other area that is not on top of your groin.
When the gout comes from the glands that are assembled together and those cause sores and are called urates, when you apply it to the section mentioned earlier and is not healthy, then consider if the treatment is needed, of a purplish color, with little feeling, do not touch or use it
If the treatment is of a purplish color and has large veins, do not use it to apply to the affected area as soon as possible; stop using that immediately if you notice
If it is of a whitish color and its veins are small, then do not use this one; rather apply the following one.
Before your operation, consider if the bandage to be used has already been removed completely or if it is necessary to remove some of it; and then apply ointment between the patient's thighs, place a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
It should be light or dark in color, subtle as cotton.
When you place it in the mouth and show it to the patient, cover it over your own hand; then put it into the affected area, wipe it off frequently as much as possible. The initial sentence seems to imply that the medical treatment involves an instrument of some kind.
The initial sentence seems to imply that the medical treatment involves an instrument of some kind. The initial sentence seems to imply that the medical treatment involves a pair of forceps. However, the extramitaz (what I assume is an error for extramità) of them are broken, so none of those can be used in its place, but it's suggested that we use another instrument instead.
If this instrument is not available at the moment, then please indicate which one of these tools it should be replaced with: And that tool shall act as if it were in its place on one side only; do not use it for the other side.
If you have used a spoon, then please indicate which of the following utensils should be used instead: And apply this cooking utensil to protect the patient's mouth from being washed out.
If the patient is suffering from bleeding or spitting blood, please use the following utensils to protect its mouth: And apply this cooking utensil to ensure that no external fluids enter it during bleeding, and treat it as soon as possible if needed.
The last sentence seems to imply that you should indicate which of the two spoons listed below should be used together with one another for this procedure:
The female patient had been treated with an ointment that was not in her stomach, the ointment tended to cause a violent color change and few feelings, as it closed off her stomach, she was unable to eat or drink water, and was likely dying if left untreated for one day or two.
The steward has already prepared that there were two steps inside, so I had to pass through two doors.
Then you should first remove the first door completely and take that one away, after which there will be a large hole through which you have to pass, so I had to go through two doors.
Then remove the large part of it and only leave behind a small one Absolutely remove the large part of that thing and then start to drink water, so you shouldn't keep putting in a needle until long after it has been inserted into that place for a while, and finish it off at that place where it was inserted, which is inside somewhere for quite some time.
Then you should engrave and cauterize the large part of it, so attach to that; after which you should prepare a meal with something edible near it.
Chapter 70
The moment the needle was inserted
When the cold sore occurs on the eyelid and it is large and round, then doctors call it a canker sore.
When you have already opened the space as mentioned in the division and it doesn't cause any discomfort, and every time that is repeated, the pain will become more subtle, so that you notice that which are added to its roundness; and if it is of a long length and bloodiness, that is an issue of black or white color, but not at center, then be aware of the incision in the thigh, for from this point there is fear about the patient.
When you do it for the second time with a hand that is of the patient's whiteness and length, make sure to hold back the intestine or hernia from coming out, place your hand over the area to prevent it from exiting, and cut off that in two pieces using one of the two instruments mentioned in the incision of the thigh.
And when you don't cut it but instead adjust it over the natural addition of its circumference, as if you cut off from it more, then lead it to speak louder.
After the incision is done, use one of those that we recommended in the division of two thighs and sew it up so as to be healthy
If the patient feels nervous during the incision of the thigh and the cautery instrument water causes pain and trembling, place your hand over its head to prevent it from moving and quickly take hold of the tongue with the recommended instrument, push down on it and let a sharp stream of water come out.
"The space between the patient's legs is prepared with a cushion and another servant on their legs; an additional one is placed over them to hold their hands in place while administering medicine, which may include applying it directly into the mouth or onto the chest.
"After placing the medicine on their chest and into the mouth/throat area (not specifying how), it is necessary to prevent any saliva or mucus from getting in, as this may cause irritation.
"If desired, you may also place a cotton ball on the affected extremity and submerge it in the medicine; insert this into an intravenous cannula so that the cotton adheres to its interior walls, ensuring continuous exposure for 24-72 hours or more depending on the severity of the burn.
"If you do not wish to administer the medicine directly into the vein of the affected extremity using a cannula: instead, continue to bathe it with warm water and apply creams containing moisture, emollients, and disinfectants in order to protect and maintain the integrity of the skin.
"This specific care is recommended for those who have been exposed to long periods of fear or terror.
When you have removed the clothing and exposed the body to air, apply a cold cautery and incision gently over it so that it is not painful for the patient.
Insert one end into the patient's mouth and apply heat to the uvula so that it is covered over the vulva
Then gently remove the pad that you have placed there and do not apply this treatment immediately after inserting it because it might be uncomfortable for the patient, so only declare that the pad has been applied to prevent anything coming out through the urethra.
If you are not using this instrument, place a cloth pad on the patient's side to prevent the urethra from being burned by hot air.
This treatment is good for health.
Chapter Fifty-eight
Of spines and of causes that adhere to the gallbladder and other internal organs.
The clothing adheres to the gallbladder or spine, or any other cause.
When you have extracted that from those it is evident as to what the eyes can see and your tongue cannot perceive, please declare aloud that this is in Latin
When you have extracted that from those it is evident as to what the eyes can see and your tongue cannot perceive, please declare aloud that this is in Latin. You may remove a chicken and have it cooked and prepared, or take a pork and prepare the meat as well.
If not for those causes that I mentioned, then do with an instrument of gold according to this manner
The greater the distance from it is the easier it is for you to enter into its cavity in a simple manner.
The head should be raised in him and make sure that the touch of his throat is gentle to avoid choking or tearing the muscle tissue or veins, or having the doctor put their hand there.
The patient should enter the intestine and remove his hand from the instrument there after making sure that it is in its place due to the cause added on and is pulled out gently down while keeping their hand over it as much as necessary for the extraction to be successful.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot
And if it is necessary to make incisions on the surface of the foot.
Then, when making cuts on the surface of the foot, be gentle and subtle about it.
If it is not possible to perform an incision on the surface of the foot, then place a soft and curved needle into its cavity, making sure that you preventively close its opening with fire, so as to avoid any damage (in case of death or rupture) in the process.
And after the wound has been cleaned with water and closed its mouth in that way, wash it clean using that same method; avoid causing any further injury or harm to the patient's body for a duration of one hour as long as the gout persists.
If not everything is done as you were instructed to do it, then the doctor will apply a cold or hot object through the instrument that was recommended in the treatment of the tonsils.
When joint pain arises from cold humors, causing infiltration in each part of the body.
There is another type of operation in the smoke, namely to use a hollow cover on which there are hollow and covered holes near the instrument's handle; it covers that part to prevent the smoke from escaping into the other parts; pause the patient if they try to open their mouth during the procedure.
If not, stop the smoke procedure and prevent the patient from drinking salty water or eating anything else; it is also necessary to ensure that this treatment is discontinued.
This is the shape of the instrument that is used for such an operation as mentioned earlier. When placed on the chest, its extremity is similar to that of a cicone beak, which catches things and holds them tightly; when any cause occurs, it will let go immediately.
The end.
Which is the sum of all the meaning in this treatise, and it includes the parts of words and their endings.
When the patient's pain occurs in the feet
The physician will make cuts and incisions in various places, such as those mentioned above, to drain the humors from them
The second servant will be placed in locations where the body's organs are located, such as the head being one location and the anus another location; it will also have incisions made for them, so that when they occur (organs) surgery is necessary.
The servants mentioned earlier are those whose openings should not be made by cutting but rather with the application of a poultice, whether on them or in relation to them.
When the servant is crushed or injured at its location and not healed properly after that, it can cause damage to the main intestine (large intestine), leading to a fistula being formed, either at the anus or another location; if done without proper preparation, such as improper positioning of the opening of the large intestine may lead to hernia formation. "You know that the time has come for the puncture of the vein, as so it is when matured.
"You know that it is mature when the cutting of pain and fever ends, as well as the reduction in swelling and pulse, and the sharpness of the vein's head, and others nerves.
"You know that the puncture must be done in a very small location between the vein and the surface to prevent bleeding from the vein or nearby areas.
"The puncture must be done on the surface of the flesh or the body, if the veins are in the hands or feet, and at locations like those between the ribs, nerves cords, arches; and finally, in all places not reflected, where it is used; wherever there is reflection, use a second puncture for that member.
"When the vein is in a place that bleeds easily, it is customary to make the puncture inside and confirm digestion of it as well; but if you puncture it this way, prolonged pain in the belly area or throat may occur, and very painful labias are caused by deeper penetration.
"If you pierce the veins in a position that is necessary or in which part of the body it is important to do.
When you administer a small incision, a larger one, or make a large incision with a scalpel depending on the variety of sizes needed
When the abscess is completely opened and closed, when you do it in terms that have already been described, as well as with those who fall into the second group of abscesses.
The ones with three angles are the abscesses that have been described as those who have a funnel-like shape, and those which are incised in such a way that they resemble the angle of a miter.
Of these ones administered with a round incision or a crescent-shaped incision, and those like them.
For that one for which it is not necessary to make a surface incision as you do with those who have a superficial incision or only one.
When the abscess is large and has already caused some damage to the body in that moment, you perforate it with no need for external drainage at that time; extract from it one piece, place it on another day, and if necessary do a larger extraction, and prepare the abscess cavity by removing any accumulated pus as needed.
If the patient is very sick or in critical condition, or if they are weak and frail from old age, let the spirit of the animal lead to the exit of the abscess, and do not remove it gently unless absolutely necessary, so as to avoid harming them.
When you have opened a space with great caution and placed your incision in the manner that allows incisions into this, consider whether the plague of the incision is small or flat, then adjust how you administer any remedies to it or its opposite side; if the incision is large and the fissures from the incision are wide, pause for any other wounds nearby.
If the incision is completely closed or convexly curved, then you must apply a dressing to it and wait until morning; if there are any tears or fissures in addition to them, keep them moist, and stretch that part every third day; take care of this and cure whatever comes into contact with it so that everything becomes healthy.
If you encounter bleeding during the time of your operation, then administer cold water and apply a dressing to it, and place that on top of the location from where the blood was flowing.
If bleeding continues after the operation, then you must administer medication and care as recommended in other locations from this book and division.
If it is in the winter and the location of the incision is a nerve area, then you must apply powders from cold water and oil on top of them, placing that there.
When it is hot and the limbs are swollen with water or oil or wine, then such gout occurs in these parts that cause them to come out suddenly through openings between them when touched; hence, one who knows how can prevent this by treating such gout promptly as I have mentioned above.
It is therefore necessary to consider the common knowledge of universal treatment methods and also discuss individual case treatments separately.
The sixty-first chapter.
In the following section, we will examine those that appear in the scalp area.
In the scalp region, there are two types of nodules that contain tunics which can be seen; and the smaller ones.
The nodules on them are small, and those containing moisture similar to lime. The nodules of the latter type contain moisture similar to dust, and they are rough on the outside; and those that are soft.
In all sections, except in the section dealing with them [nodules], and apart from their removal there is no need to worry; but when it comes time for removing these, then you should not let your guard down.
The operation in the section of nodules is to remove them with an instrument that you have just described; which is called extramission, through which it should be known.
When humidity is present, the pain spreads to another part of the body second, then it spreads in a superficial section, like this way:
The pain is first spread to the part between .B. and .G., then it spreads in a superficial section like this:
If the humidity is present, then apply it in oil and salt; otherwise, apply it wet and dry; and put it on that part of the body where you want to remove it, as long as there are no other causes for its removal, so that it dissolves entirely from that layer.
Then apply it again to that part of the body second and third times when you confirm there are no other causes for its removal, in order to cure the pain from that area.
If you suspect fatty deposits, then apply it like this way: In the section of the body that you suspect fatty deposits to be present in, apply it between two lines at the end of that section and remove all from its entirety, while stretching your neck in order to extract what is present.
If your arteries are stiff, then apply it first.
"The doctor will now make a small incision and examine the patient's abdomen in order to check for any signs of infection or inflammation.
"The doctor will first make an incision in the head of the patient to check for any signs of inflammation or infection.
"The doctor will then make additional small incisions in the patient's other areas such as the ears and eyebrows.
"The doctor will then apply a small amount of saline to cleanse the body from any remaining infections in the wounds.
"The doctor will now begin caring for the patient.
"Chapter 62.
"The doctor will then make a small incision in the abdomen to expose the ovaries, if necessary.
"The doctor will then examine and treat any other areas of the body that may be affected.
"And for those that are affected in the abdomen and between them, and all sores of these are part of its own clothing, as well as in the head's veins and organs.
"The symptoms of these sores are multiple, from those that contain moisture to those that contain malignant matter, and those that are both moist and malignant.
"In that area where you have good disposition towards the Circumflex, its color is indicative of the color of the Circe, and it's malignant throughout; do not insert anything into any superficial part of this line until you have inserted it into another line.
"Be careful that nothing is inserted into a vein or nerve.
"Do not insert the knife into anything except for that which is necessary to incise; if you inserted a vein or artery and it prevents your operation, pause in the bloody bandage applied or powder from those that still flow with poison, cover them up, and lay down this thing so that its sharpness will be softened. "When the incision is complete.
"Then return to your operation after completing it.
When it is suspected that there may be a small abscess in one of the thighs or legs, immediately look for and examine those parts
If you suspect that it is a large abscess in one of the veins, then look closely at that part Look carefully and see if there are any openings or leaks through which fluids may flow out.
Then place a cloth soaked in ice water on the affected part and keep it there to cool it down.
If you suspect that the abscess has already ruptured, then place a cloth soaked in ice water on both of your legs and hold it there to prevent any excess fluids from coming out.
If you suspect that the abscess has already burst through swelling of the abscess (scrophula), look closely at it and drain it with a needle to prevent further damage and to this end.
The abscesses that contain fluids should be punctured with a sharp needle here where the surface is easily accessible to prevent any further damage and to this end.
Then provide a bandage soaked in cold water on the affected area, cover it up and try to control any bleeding from that. Then, when you suspect that the abscess has already burst, look carefully at it and drain it with a needle to prevent further damage and to this end.
When joints ache due to cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, as well as pain in the feet, it is customary among doctors to call gout.
The doctor's assistant will cut off a section of the patient's hair at the nape of their neck.
They shall remove that section from the head and show it to nobody in our land.
This is the inscription of the medical treatise.
In the meantime, if it is necessary to remove that section from the head, by this means they should not be severed immediately and all veins of the patient will be here.
If the patient coughs when eating hot food or drinks, and if the illness is not in the throat, it would be necessary to remove that section of hair so as to prevent its escape by tearing.
When we want this (removal of the section from the head), then insert three circles into the circles of the head or four smaller sections near the latitude at which there is space between two circles in proportion, that section should be made on a pillow rather than in the flesh, and this location serves to prevent the escape.
If the doctor is afraid that spreading the cold humor in that way may cause an illness to come out through the channel, then they should try to prevent this by closing it off so as not to allow any of these causes for disease.
"Here, the passage is being translated: 'Then place a cushion under them and another on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.' This means that they are performing an abdominal examination.
The physician has taken out his bag of tools for some time now.
When the time comes that a passage needs to be made, add two blades of the surgeon's scalpels and cut into it with one stroke.
And then administer medicines which make sick flesh disappear when they are sick.
And the summary of what we have recommended is that you should see if the ulcers caused by the disease have been cured and the patient has recovered from the illness, and then the ulcers are to be closed, and the ulcers must be cut in such a way as to prevent the ulcer causing the patient from coming out through the passage, so they cannot breathe it out through any breathing hole, and will be saved from death.
And by this command the bag is to be placed into what has been cured of the illness in ulcers, and it lasts for three days, so the physician commands thus that it be done with the bag, and cures it until it is healed.
And after you have seen through my means, it is that a servant places their hand on the chest and cuts into its cavity with one stroke; then they are called upon to care for him, and also bring down the sack which was from the bag's part
Indeed you confessed that there was no wound or injury, and the wind was blowing from the plague; and it cured him by fire.
Do not accuse the physician if he does not agree with the oaths, but let him return to his duties.
And now you say that in the section of the epilogue there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Of the section about the apostrophe which occurs in the forehead, and it is called a forehead hernia.
The forehead apostrophe is sometimes also called a big one after the skin of the face, and it occurs in women as well.
It can be caused by nature or accident.
In the case of a natural one it cannot be cured.
The accidental one is the second type that can be similar to a grass knot, and another kind of hernia caused by blockage in an artery occurs as well. Do not assume it will happen if you do not eat certain foods unless the one is small. You should also examine that one and the other as well, for example if it is similar to a fat knot or does not block any vein, then you should identify both of them with those found in the skin and bursa; otherwise, they are considered invalid and appropriate treatment is given to where care must be taken so that the injury may heal.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Then you will divide the parts of the veins.
You have divided all the parts into one division.
And note that there is a difference between nodes and exits, as you will discuss below.
Then you say that a hernia is called heat and fever, and pain occurs as the body tries to expel excess fluid; it also involves putrefaction, which stops the fever, pain, and heat.
A node is neither hot nor fever nor pain, but it is characterized by a lump that arises from the body itself.
The color of the body is next mentioned; at first it appears like a lump and grows as well or poorly, being one of two parts, either wet or dry, containing humidity, with different colors depending on the amount of humidity in the division.
Therefore, when you approach the cure for a node, inquire if it is an introitus or if it comes out on its own as swelling begins; and then examine its appearance in relation to what was mentioned above.
Investigate the openings and all nodes, and make sure to put that one into the moist place where you found it in the aperture; as you insert them little by little until you discover that one has already entered the urethra.
When you have finished preparing the patient's limbs as described above, it is now time to place a cushion on their chest and then extend your hand towards them while considering that it should be in front of the memorial.
If the current humidity is unknown or of an unusual color, you should first apply a superficial incision as I mentioned in the previous passage.
If there is no moisture at the opening, it means that the testicle has been removed (castrated).
Cut through this incision in a straight line. When you have cut through this incision and removed the intestines as described earlier, make sure to cleanse all of it thoroughly with a washcloth or towel.
If it was not removed during the surgery and cannot be reattached due to some reason or another, you must treat the wound thoroughly as described earlier in order for it to heal properly.
If something went wrong during surgery, return to this step later.
If a small portion of it was removed during the surgery and you need to complete the skin incision as described earlier with corrosive substances that are sharp and sting the incision, and place the cautery on top of that which is in front of the memorial, and treat that area with further care until it heals.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If the pulse is against or not-pulsatile, you are to cleanse and empty that place where it was thought (lit: "that vein") with two days or three for it to cease its pain, and postpone the ebullition of this; and then return to incision on that vein.
The following line is a part of a poem from the Roman poet Ovid's "The Metamorphoses". Can you translate it into English?
Because of the forms necessary in sectioning and perforation.
Of these is the shape of the vestibule, it's also three species which are big, medium and small
The great one is this form
The smallest one is this one.
When you are to perform surgery, from anesthesia, on the extremities carefully for fear that it does not reach the opening of the passage.
These are the shapes of the parts, their names are well-known, and one of these is called beard.
The three sizes: large, medium, small
The manner of experiencing great pleasure, the way in which it occurs
The manner of experiencing lesser pleasure
The manner of experiencing a little pleasure
These are the openings and excisions, fistulae and abscesses that lead to these causes, between which bones and other causes there may be
These are the openings that must be closed, great ones with large hooks to sew up the wounds, and those that come from cuts or blows, or from arrows, and many more when there is much pain in the same place.
They are the openings that experience black pain and it is agreed that through these they must be closed in the cavities of those who have reflections that occur from their bodies, which reflection occurs on their chest in those reflections.
There are three types: the large ones that occur less frequently, and those of lesser frequency for others, and those which are smaller according to the amount of the fistula and the constriction of them.
The manner in which great pleasure occurs
The manner in which lesser pleasure occurs
The manner in which a little pleasure occurs
These varieties are of the three types that exist, with some very simple ones, those being only curved and there are also three sorts: great ones, few and lesser ones.
When a person has very cold feet, three servants are needed.
The first servant will help the patient to straighten their bent legs and arms with a cushion support as necessary.
If three servants are needed for curvature, then there must be at least three servants.
Everything is necessary in that place
A simpler way is to do it.
When one has two curvatures, the following is necessary: Another way would be to do it like this: A simpler way could be to do it that way.
When one has three curvatures, the following is necessary:
Another way would be to do it like this:
These are the forms of knives which will cut and pierce the nodes and nails, and have three servants.
The form for a large knife is
Form of the scalpel:
Form of a small scalpel
The edges of the incision should be sharp and the others smooth or rounded, not to cause any damage to blood vessels or nerves, for those reasons the surgeon aims to minimize pain in the patient's body and provide a comfortable environment during the healing process after the operation.
These are the forms of the scalpel blades, there are three types: large, medium and small, as you see.
Those who use it also have similar forms in the hand with which they perform the operation.
It is at the edges of the hidden part that you should be careful with, especially when cutting and removing tissues or bones, as you will do so
The forms of the sponges used in medical practice, there are three types large, medium and small, as you see. These are the forms of the instruments.
The forms of the tubes that separate the flow from air and water are large, medium, and small.
When there are cold humors in the feet, it causes pain.
The areas that are affected by these humors tend to be the joints and extremities (hands, feet), which may cause pain due to their sensitivity and lack of protection in cold conditions, hence it is not considered medical treatment when experienced at the first onset.
The areas affected by these humors should not be found anywhere on the body except for the hands and feet (and possibly other sensitive areas like the calves of legs, thighs, breasts, and belly).
Some veins are affected by these humors in a similar way to the previous conditions; when they become obstructed through phlebotomy (a procedure for removing veins) or due to injury of the vein itself, pain is experienced.
Some veins are affected similarly:
Chapter 47.
The cure of the breasts in men, which resemble those found in women.
Some veins in the breasts of men swell when they sleep like those found on women's breasts, and swelling occurs from this same cause; and are similar to the breasts that you find on women, therefore it is necessary for them to seek medical attention.
"And for that who wishes to learn these remedies, if you want to study the lunar line from this form of B up until the line G and then apply a poultice on every spot where necessary with a medicated plaster, and adjust both sides of the affected area.
"And if the nipple declines to join in on these parts and is too small for this size of patches, then adjust its position between two sides of the affected area until it is aligned with both sides.
"And if you do not fulfill the prescription of this to bring about a sense of calm in the patient and to reduce swelling, then apply it soaked with corrosive vinegar until that which flows from its roots is cured and adjusted for health.
"Chapter 58.
"Of the puncture wounds that come by chance.
"The punctures of the letters that come from thorns are of the species of scrophulas and thorns which have one feature in common.
"The space between the patient's thighs being moist, and those that contain moisture which may become infected when exposed to lunar light for this period: from line .G. to line .B.
"Place the cushion under them and make it comfortable in this position.
"If the abdomen incision is made, and for the abscesses, you should also mention it in this section.
"If the incision is long enough to cause bleeding, then apply cautery here as well.
"Chapter 49.
"Of incisions that occur due to arteries or veins.
"When an artery is ruptured and the clot has settled over it, then the arteries near by become inflamed and the vein will be affected: when the incision occurs through the artery, it will cause a swelling in the chest; and if you attempt to remove the incision at these points, there may be stridor.
"In that case, it is reflected on the surface of the chest.
"The incision over this part is usually made in the abdomen, chest, and navel areas; it should be small enough so that its cure cannot be avoided.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and especially in the feet, it is customary to call gout by doctors.
And if it is necessary to place an arrow and let it penetrate into another part of the body, stretch out the intestine tightly in two places - the one causing pain will be expelled from both openings of the bowels which are near them.
And place that spot between two straps on the surface so it will come out completely when it is in there, and dissolve its purpose.
And administer care to the one born with short hamstrings so that they may come out conveniently, and care for him when he emerges in this way so that he is healed.
If it is necessary to make an incision into the vein, you must have your hand on its surface so that it comes out of the vein's channel, and push the arrow in; and be at this double fold where you extract the other part from another location, and bind it with a second thread for both sides of two parts of the thread.
If you want to remove the thread, open up the vein and insert the needle as before, and stretch your threads in four places.
When the gout is present in the body and it has already become apparent that this is what we are dealing with at this point, doctors prescribe rest for the patient to prevent further complications.
Apply a powder that you have soaked in water and oil, then administer the remedy which is known to be soothing and alleviates the pain when applied topically.
The first sentence translates to "the space between the thighs
When the gout attacks joints and veins as well as when it is caused by a blow or stroke that could be harmful, in such cases.
It is customarily placed on the joints of the assistant or the table, or in any location where the joints are affected.
The gout is severe and spreads to other parts of the body, causing it to feel numb as though in a trance.
It is not customary to apply the poultice on the abdomen or any other part of the body except the affected joints, and after it has been applied, there will be numbness throughout the entire body with no sensation in front or behind.
In such cases, it is not advisable to apply on the joints as further application could cause a contraction of the muscles.
May it be done on top or in the front so that a cordon can be made over his chest If too much is added, then loosen the cords and remove them from their shoulders.
If it's too tight, then take away some of the cordage and remove them, and adjust the padding, and fix the wound as best you can.
I don't understand this sentence or its meaning in context
If a patient has an abscess that is causing pain in the belly.
Among the many kinds of excrements that are ejected from these openings and the various parts of the body which serve as channels for eliminating them with a subtlety similar to those in use by the liver, of which the head is large; and then they talk to those who are small, and to those who are magnificent.
And you saw one in it and then in his belly were two channels which were quite similar to each other, without being different because of their thinness.
And the openings of those would be opened and they would separate themselves, and moisture would run out from them at all times.
Therefore you instruct these and lead them to the one in each of the eighteenth hour, and then to the other which is on the twelfth hour.
When making an incision on the patient's thigh it is considered that if the sores are moist and the color of the flesh is white, humid, subtle dewiness; the sores should be incised at a spot on the lat side near your watchfulness, in front of your cauldron you must burn them with cautery or else they will spread. If you touch them when inflamed, cauterize it
If the sores are purulent and fearful, make a slit near it when you cut into it; if the sores are covered with recent pus, stretch that flesh, the vein of which is called the finger vein; and lay that over for two days.
Then adjust it in the vein of the flesh; then do not stretch the great veins underneath, except if they are absent and cause a hernia to appear through itself.
If the flesh is of great thickness, incisions into it will cause no fear or worry and more in that which is within the belly.
It is possible to make an incision through the whole of it, and then cautorize that so as not to return.
Then cure that within which has been wounded.
And remember to not make incisions into flesh that is of a dark color, few sentiment, and light regard; for such are abashed wounds.
The first sentence translates to: You must remember your appointment clearly.
The corrected sentence is: Remember your appointment clearly.
Stomachache from constipation.
Stomachache from a blockage in the umbilical vein or artery (due to a tear), constipation causing intestinal obstruction, or from a narrowed section of the intestine itself.
The pain may be due to a tear in the diaphragm and pain spreading through the surface of the body, causing the skin over it to appear pale or white like the body's color; this may also indicate pain spreading from there If it is due to the intestine coming out (hernia), you will know that situation from here as described earlier, in many cases there are different pains and sensations; if you press on this area too much, it may cause intense pain and swelling of the abdomen.
The pain may be due to moisture (inflammation), but it won't stop if you press on the area with your hand or feel for anything inside; there is no feeling of constriction or fullness.
If it is due to an obstruction (obstruction), the pain may spread over the surface and appear black as the skin darkens.
The pain may be due to a piece of flesh being caught or trapped inside, it is very hard, heavy, and feels like something stuck in place; if you try to remove it without knowing what exactly is there, the sensation can spread over the body and cause intense pain.
When joints are affected by cold humors, doctors call it gout
If the abscess is located in the groin region or vein location, doctors caution to avoid treatment of that area as it carries a risk and could lead to more serious consequences if not properly attended to
If the abscess is located in the groin region or in the abdominal wall, doctors instruct the patient to keep it intact as much as possible, and extend their arm over that area towards the other side of their body so they can monitor for any signs of leakage, also instructing them to gently press on the abdomen to feel if there are any contractions.
If you miss the abscess and it doesn't leak, doctors instruct to squeeze as hard as possible to try to get rid of it and urge them to press firmly on their abdomen to feel for any contractions that may indicate leakage.
If you find the abscess, doctors instruct to pick it up and examine its contents.
If it is contrary to the artery or vein, doctors caution you and instruct to redo your procedure using two needles placed in opposite corners of the area where you punctured it, making sure that both needles penetrate, then stretch the abscess over them four times.
"When you wish to, cut the skin and let it bleed freely so that all the fat can be removed easily; or if there is a suspicion of any internal disease, make an incision in such a way as to drain out the entrails.
"If the prominence of the belly is caused by fat and not moisture, then doctors advise to cut through it as before, or if there are signs of dampness, drain off that too, and close up the wound.

About care for a wound
We have said that in the division of care for a wound and how to approach it from medical practices, which is important when carrying out such care because not all wounds are ulcers; we have also mentioned the generation of new wounds through excessive caution in caring for them.
Whenever old wounds are found in locations where it is possible to eradicate them, as well as when they appear on the breasts or buttocks and any other part of the body that can be reached with ease, especially if they occur first thing in the morning
If it is old and large, do not attempt to remove it, because if you cannot heal from this wound or prevent further damage, do nothing about it.
The operation is when it is inserted like this as we have said, you precede and loosen the ulcerated flesh with cold water jets some vegetables, and then proceed to that place if found clearly manifested.
Then prepare the ulcerated flesh for the operation, and proceed to that place where you were previously directed; then focus on a thorough examination of all parts until nothing remains unexplained in the causes of this disease. Then loosen the sutures and remove them gradually, examine all places, and treat with the largest possible ointment or instrument that may be among your instruments.
If it is necessary to make incisions of vein or artery, the ulcers will be burned until the flow of blood has ceased, and then treat as before with another treatment.
Afterwards.
The treatment for dropsy.
We have recommended in the division of dropsy from water and the necks of each species, to treat with medicines.
And that which is treated by burning alone is the species of madness only, and it's not recommended to treat the species of tinnitus or hydrophobia because this would be fatal.
"When you have already applied the specific diuretic medicine and it does not interfere with your treatment, the doctor considers that a bladder infection has occurred or another urinary tract infection is present, so if this is in the abdomen area as well.
"If the bladder is bursting with urine and there are no other infections present, only urinary tract infection symptoms appear in this way.
"In this case, the operation will be performed in two parts: first, an acute extremity and second, an acute point of approach.
"Consider that the cause of the urinary tract infection may be from both kidneys and also note that doctors often take three samples to determine whether it is in fact an infection or something else.
"If the cause of urinary tract infection is due to kidney disease, doctors often take three samples from the left side of the abdomen.
"If it's due to some other cause, then doctors will typically take three samples on the right side of the abdomen.
The first sentence translates to: "Do not place your section on the side that will hold back the patient, as it may cause too much tension there.
The second sentence translates to: "Put the instrument all the way in and then move into that section, placing your hand between the incision site and a flap of skin, you should elevate it and then remove it. If one flap is sufficient or not.
The third sentence translates to: "Put the tissue between the incision site and a flap of skin that extends beyond it, as it is located at the edge. The fourth sentence translates to: "Then retract this one and move an instrument whose shape is like this... The fifth sentence translates to: "...its shape is like a fine needle. It can be made of silver or iron or lead, at which in the beginning it is a small trap, and on its sides there are three traps: two from one side and one from another side; and this extremity is fixed by placing your hand over it, as shown below.
In the extremity of it where there is a small trap when the instrument penetrates water, the hand should be placed over the instrument to remove it from the water as quickly as possible, because if you do not evacuate it in time, then severe pain may occur for the patient due to inflammation of their internal organs, or you might die within five minutes.
"Firstly, remove from that quantity of the virtue of him and secondly what they mean by the disposition of the patient in terms of the goodness of him.
"Then take the instrument and apply water that caused it to be kept hidden by a seal which seals over the place where they recommend you to perform this second time.
"Then apply the instrument on that day if you are able to tolerate it, and extract a small amount of water, and do so for many days until it subsides, keeping your hand out of water unless it is very little.
"If you are worried about the patient, let them drink large amounts of water and cure that by immersing their feet in a bucket full of sand, wiping it with cloth, and exposing it to sunlight for some time; and cure the dry medicine when they are thirsty.
"Burns above the stomach and gently apply water extraction after applying this medicine as mentioned before.

"The care for children who have not learned the paths to urine retention.
"Some vegetables should not be given to children whose belly button and head are not cleaned, or if the hole is blocked, the stool will come out very hard.
The surgeon's knife must be so sharp that it cuts through a small piece of flesh smoothly.
After pausing briefly on the point to bind it tightly, and then for three days or more...
When urine is excreted, return
If you do not pause the point, it may be that the urine which has been over the area does not allow this hole to open.
The surgeon will use a smaller blade for making this cut, as mentioned before, and it may take days or more to be fully amplified.
The ones whose urethra is obstructed by this cut will have difficulty urinating at the opening of the day, and it is necessary to elevate the vagina with your hand over that area during urination in order for semen not to come out when ejaculating from the anus.
The procedure's method is that the patient is seated over their own back, and you extend your left arm towards the vagina to insert it gently into the vagina while holding tightly with both hands.
"In your operation for bleeding from the vein, where are the veins located? And do you stop the bleeding and treat the wound if it is healed?
"The sixth letter 'I' in Latin.
"Remove the part of the brain that causes headaches and dizziness, and increase blood circulation to the head.
"The vein causing this pain is in the neck; sensation of numbness in the arm.
"If it is malignant, and if not, what should be done?
"If it is not malignant, then apply a subtle incision to remove it entirely, and place your hand over the affected area to prevent any further damage or infection. Then treat the affected area with medication until it heals.
"If it is malignant then call for a surgeon and let them perform the incision and remove it.
"If the vein is in the neck and not circumcised, and if its removal leads to healing immediately after it's removed, but there's a chance of recurrence; then cure that recurrence by treating the previous wound until you heal.
"When one or both testicles are inflamed and sore inside the scrotum, if you want to treat it with harsh means and want it to be corrupted or ruined; do put a line on that place so as not to let it mix with any other parts of the body.
"Do apply another treatment, if necessary, in order for it to be healthy.
If you have an abscess that needs drainage, the doctor may administer a caustic therapy.
A young man has two remedies at his disposal; one is for abscesses and the other is for ulcers when they become corrupted.
If the tip of the vein is corrupted and destroyed at that moment, it may be necessary to insert a needle through the anus in order for the patient's urine to pass from there.
When the adhesion between the veins of the penis (and this adhesion should not occur in those where the penis is soft, and over it no circumcision is required; and when adhesion occurs through a fistula or abscess) you must excise all the adhesions that are dissolved and deliver the tip of the vein completely.
If it is difficult to remove them completely, the doctor may excise any cause from the vein and penis, so that they are separated; as well, when the penis is soft and easily perforated by its own fragility.
Between the anus and the head of the vagina, there is a small hole through which urine may sometimes leak if it is not covered properly
It should be maintained as tightly sealed as possible.
VII
To circumcise children and the care of that which happens around the time of circumcision.
Circumcision is not the solution for longevity or to prevent these plagues: but if it is part of our operation and our will, and if they are performed in children, then we need to assign this as our best operation because otherwise there would be great difficulty finding doctors who agree with us on health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients would not circumcise in free persons because it is not used in their laws and only because of experimentation, which causes this to be a major part of circumcision and mutilation at new and young; they use faith and obedience as a constant companion.
And you already have forbidden all these manners and not allowed the best circumcision with faith, because it is sure that the urethra will never be blocked by anything except two rings; it seals both the top of the prepuce to two tunics, covers the tone inside with a soft membrane, and is very light so as not to cause any other injury or pain. When the opening of the urethra is painful and urgent, it can be dangerous to the genital member, as the urine may flow too fast into the bladder.
During the operation, you must stay still and prevent any movement that could harm or contaminate your surgery. A baby's cry is short by nature and usually stops within a few minutes without any medical need for catheterization, unless otherwise indicated
When making a catheterization that goes through the urethra and prostate gland, it is important to use an appropriately sized catheter so as not to cause any unnecessary damage or injury, as the pain experienced should correspond with the pain of urination; additionally, if you pre-measure your urine output before starting the process, it can be done in one time period. The compression cuff on the penis contains a hole for the urethra and its contents, preventing it from coming out accidentally.
The first priority of the operation is to ensure that you stay still and only apply the catheter gently into the urethra without causing any damage or injury; it should then be left in place for another day.
The most important thing to remember during this procedure is that it's up to your discretion on how to perform it, so please exercise your intelligence in order to achieve the best possible result. In order for your preparation to be complete and not cause any discomfort, it is recommended that you place a cushion between the buttocks, do not let them touch each other; and also cover up the fingers in your hand or put a bandage on the foot so that the child will not see those or anything else of the instruments.
Between your hand and the vagina of her, blow on it gently; pull it out so that its head is outside, and arrange it in such a way as to make it hard when excited.
The way to make fingers move is as follows:
The fingers should alternate between touching and not touching, so that the length of their stroke is as the same as the length of two thumbs together.
When there is a mistake in the making of the intrinsic coding that cannot be resolved or is missing altogether, it has to be programmed anew.
Then go on extending the amount of time until you reach your target heart rate and continue taking breaks at regular intervals.
If you can't hold it for as long as your target heart rate, extend the break and take that one instead.
If it takes more than three days to flatten the bruise and you notice that it's healing slowly, then go ahead with applying the ointment, as it is the most effective one, and use this instead of the others once you are prepared.
And remember to cover your bruise from head to toe so that nothing else can be seen above it.
Then use the ointment as described in the chapter on powders for healing your bruise.
If it is missing from the coding that you have mentioned and misses out the parts thereof, then don't worry about it at all.
Then use the ointment as described in what I said was healing for it.
The Eighth Capital
For urinary retention, you should seek treatment from a urologist.
Urinary retention can be treated through various methods such as urethral dilation or catheterization (introducing a catheter into the bladder), or even pouching and skinning, according to what I mentioned in that section on urination care division.
If it is not caused by what we have already mentioned above, then the doctors advise to apply a syringe made of silver and fine thread with a very small opening at its tip, which resembles a tiny finger in shape; this needle should be inserted into the urethra gently, ensuring that it does not cause any pain.
The procedure for emptying the bladder is to gently insert a syringe made of silver and fine thread into it in the outer part or hole of its opening, near where urine comes out; after inserting it, you should remove the needle from inside the urethra, making sure not to cause any pain.
When you have finished examining all of the patient's relevant organs and areas, such as their bladder and urethra, you should lubricate them with olive oil to ease any friction or pain that may occur during your examination.
When you put the catheter into the vagina, make it as soft as possible to prevent stretching of the urethra; then gently pull out the vagina and place it on that side; then carefully insert the catheter into the bladder, ensuring it does not touch the prostate gland; finally, secure the catheter by pulling both sides.
When putting in a urinary catheter, make sure to do it slowly and steadily, as urine can damage the urethra.
When inserting a urinary catheter and using it to empty the bladder, ensure that you do not push or force urine out; instead use the catheter gently to remove any blockage in the urethra, as well as to relieve any discomfort in the patient's bladder.

The clamping of the vesicae and similar instruments that are agreed upon for this purpose should be applied at this time.
When vesica ulcer occurs or when a stone is stuck in it, or if there's any obstruction due to cancer, then you should use the tool called the clamping device; this is its form.
However, if there are no sounds outside of that area, it means closed off. In addition to the other two mentioned above, one is from the urethra and another comes from the bladder itself; in this case, they are both present.
The first sentence translates to "In the beginning of this location there is a thing that inflames and increases in quantity.
To pour out the humors from the bladder, insert the urethral tip into the moisture of the clitoral area and pull it back to remove the humors in the vagina.
Insert the urethral tip into the vagina after you've suggested in the urethra, and then pull it back to pour out the humors as they move towards the bladder, so that the moisture does not go back into the vagina.
The urethral tip is inserted gently at the point where the bladder is opened, and it should be like this.
It can be made of silver or gold with the shape of a small feather, and it is used to insert into the urethra gently.
After introducing it into the bladder, pause in that moisture you want to pour out of the bladder, and then gently pull this between two fingers with a firm double grip, so as to pour the moisture over the flame.
Insert the urethral tip into the vagina.
"The servant is to place his hands on the bladder, to apply moisture and stretch it inside until the urine is released from the bladder.
"If the bladder is not present, then you will take a sponge and place it in that circle; and perform all of its roundness; and firmly press into these troughs as well, so that they are rolled up; and add to the circle as if you added fat, unless you pause on this part where you want to apply the moisture.
"Then place it in an instrument and apply it as you did with the bladder, expressing that the moisture is penetrating into the bladder.
"The end of this medical treatise.
Translation: From the conclusion of this text
"We have now discussed the varieties of urine and its causes in both the lungs and bladder, as well as their symptoms.
"Now we will discuss the surgical operation for urine.
"The urine caused in the bladder is called vesicular stones.
"So we present this information briefly and succinctly.
"The urine caused in the bladder is usually accompanied by children and its symptoms are similar to water in its subtlety, appearing as such on that surface; and the patient becomes distressed, vomiting, and froths at the mouth, while urine is coming out.
The first sentence translates to: "We are going to treat children who have reached 14 years old, as it is a difficult treatment in childhood. In young people, gout can be mild due to the proximity of these two things:
The first statement translates to "in those where the attacks are frequent and treatment is more challenging.
To begin the treatment of gout, first you must extract all the waste from between the toes that infiltrates it, and then prevent its recurrence by inspecting for any signs of pain in your feet.
Then, place the patient on their back and gently massage their legs with warm water to help relieve symptoms of gout.
Then place the patient on their back and gently massage their legs with warm water to help relieve symptoms of gout.
Lastly, apply a poultice made from ground fenugreek seeds mixed with water or honey to the affected area as needed.
If you feel gout in that space, then apply heat packs on it regularly.
If you don't find relief from all the other treatments mentioned earlier, then apply heat packs to that area as needed and put a finger in its cavity regularly to check for pain or signs of inflammation. When joints are affected by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body And return the intestine or hernia to its cavity
And place your hand over that area, and expel it from where you have opened it
And order the minister to place his hand on the patient's belly; and command another minister to extend her right hand outward towards the legs, spread them apart slightly from the abdomen as a way of preventing the intestine from coming out, in the area where you make an incision.
And when it comes to making the incision itself, here is how it should be done: And when making the incision itself between the buttocks and the legs, make it in the lower part of the left thigh; and have the cut over that space as well, and have a transverse cut to prevent the intestine from coming out widely or too much, if necessary, so that no more than necessary.
And be aware that from the intestine itself there is an angle and margin to it, in order to make the effort difficult for you
From this incision downward, it should be smooth, rounded, and then made into an angle as well, so that the intestine is held in place.
"When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body.
"And if it is not a hernia as mentioned earlier, put your hand on the affected part or gently press on that area with the subtle curved instrument.
"If you cannot press on that area directly, place a small cloth or gauze over the affected part and if you see signs of infection, remove it gently.
"If the foot is swollen from swelling or gout attacks, first try pressing on it with your hand to relieve pain at the bladder's mouth and then apply a small compress over that area.
"If the foot is very swollen and you suspect one of two causes - obstruction or continuous urine leakage - then apply gentle pressure to prevent further damage.
"If the intestine or hernia is protruding out of its cavity, you should gently push it back into place.
"Once your operation is complete and the dressing has been removed from these areas, gently press down on that area. When the body becomes infiltrated by cold humors (caused by joint pain), and when pains occur in the feet.
And place the cushion beneath the patient's back, leaving his chest uncovered.
And when that happens, put on the area where water is cold and oil, applying a mixture of vinegar and oil to prevent it from coming out.
When the bladder becomes infiltrated with cold humors and cramps occur in the feet, it is forbidden to pass urine until the bladder is emptied.
And when you apply vinegar and salt to the foot, do it in such a way that it prevents urination until the bladder is emptied.
And during all of this care, put on the thighs and adjust any medications that are suspended over there.
And if the bladder is small and it is blocked in this way, you should remove it. If urination is prohibited due to this procedure, doctors recommend passing urine until that time; also after removing it, you must use a needleholder of iron, as follows:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity and place your hand over the area to prevent it from coming out.
Then insert a pointed instrument into that part of the body, making sure not to puncture the bowel, lest it pierce the penetrator. Then slowly rotate the penetrator into that cavity little by little, and make sure it does not go any further than another part penetrating, for urine must always be free.
Then gently place your hand over that part of the body to prevent urine leakage from that area, as it is sealed and secure against injury, and the patient's intestines are safe.
If that procedure is not permitted for any cause which forbids from using that part of the body, then the doctor will use another instrument instead. Then gently place the instrument between those two parts of the body. Then put it aside. Then remove any restraining straps and make sure they are loose enough to allow free movement within the bag.
If there is no need for restraining straps to prevent the intestine from coming out or herniate back into place, then remove those straps only if they are not loose enough already.
When you have opened the space between his thighs and placed cushions beneath them, another attendant should be positioned on their legs, while yet another attendant should stand at their chest with both hands extended in a gesture of respect.

The extraction or phlebotomy of the veins from the females.
Extraction or phlebotomy in the veins from women is not a common practice.
If you want to extract blood from those veins, then it would be difficult and forbidden by law.
One of the reasons could be that the woman is very thin.
Another reason could be that you don't find a female body to show the procedure at the doctor when asked, or because women have less access to medical facilities.
The third reason could be that you don't know any female who is willing and capable of performing this surgery, mainly because the operation itself requires certain skills.
The fourth reason could be that the location for phlebotomy in women is remote and far from where the bloodletting procedure takes place, causing a significant delay which adds to fear.
If you need to perform phlebotomy on her, the attendant must first find a female willing and able to assist, as it is rare to find one.
If you are in a hurry or need to find someone discreet and subtle, or present a female with experience who is knowledgeable about this practice among the females, or a woman capable of performing this task within her field of knowledge.
"Then do as you would have him perform everything that you commanded of him earlier regarding the examination from the beginning; so guard yourself in his presence and wish to see his genitals.
"Then if you are afraid of that [the genitals], cover it with your hand and instruct him regarding that.
"If she is not afraid [of the genitals], instruct her to introduce it into his hand and ask about its nature, placing your left hand over the bladder as well.
"Then if you are afraid of that [the genitals], instruct her to gradually move it from the orifice of the bladder towards your hand, avoiding any contact with his genitalia.
"Then instruct him to place it gently at the bottom of his bladder and towards its exit in that area, not causing any discomfort or pain for either party.
"The passage is short and the examination is done gently as you instruct him to enter that opening and if he feels it, adjust the angle according to how much pain or discomfort one party experiences.
"You know that the parts of the genitals are different; four of them small and large, flat and soft, long and round, without ridges.
'Therefore, you know how many sizes there are of him here from which you will indicate what you want.'
'If you see bleeding from the vein, adjust it to prevent further blood loss and then proceed with your operation as soon as possible.'
'And when you prepare the instruments that are used in the extraction of blood from the veins in men, to assist with these during your operation.'
'If you see bleeding from the vein and know that the expulsion of blood is from a vessel that is clogged, stop pressing on that area and apply pressure to prevent further blood loss; but do not extract it as doing so may cause serious harm.' 'And then proceed with the treatment.'
'Once you have allowed for the pain to subside and the area is quiet, proceed with your operation as soon as possible.'
'Chapter 12.'
'The treatment of hernia.'
'Hernia is nothing more than an accumulation of moisture in the sac that surrounds the intestine and is called a hernia.'
'Some precautions are taken during the preparation of nature in the beginning of the journey, so that nothing is missed or omitted; and it refers to the opening of the intestine through the sac that we have mentioned, not just the one but also the other.'
"The generation of this hernia is due to a certain illness that strikes the genitals, and for this reason there are ulcers that appear on the genitals.
"This humidity may cause various colors, such as the color becoming pale or blood-red, or it can be blackish, white, or yellowish; this is what makes it most troublesome.
"The ulcers caused by this humidity can be: if it is on the phlegm of white color mentioned earlier, then the ulcers are very deep and extend to some extent along the length; they appear in the genitals because the humidity affects that area too.
"If it is on the private part of the skin, then the ulcers appear as if they come from another place.
"If it is between the genitals and phlegm of white color mentioned earlier, then the ulcers spread widely.
"To know the hue of the humidity, you spread out its color in the ulcer before it appears on the skin's surface and then consider what is left behind.
"Then when we come to cure it, tell the patient that if this is possible, he should apply cold water to his body.
When joint pain arises from cold humors that permeate every part of the body, especially in the feet; it is customary for doctors to call this gout.
Place the hand on the left side of the patient and command the attendant to follow with their right hand, extending it towards both sides of the waist at the bottom of the navel button
Place the foot on its side, and stretch out your legs towards the front pillar.
Then insert it in such a way that both ends of the intestines lie within the white membrane, and they are properly positioned.
Then, observe it and keep that in mind so you do not cut it; and your excision should be such that the cut is made to the extent that the membrane covering allows for it.
Then perform a wide incision in the white membrane and extract all of the water out of it.
Then separate two parts of the incision, and extend it to both sides; do not touch the navel button or the genitalia inside the membrane, and insert the incision at that place where you can do so. Then insert it completely or partially, making the incision as long and thin as possible, so that if you do not perfectly execute the incision, then it will be safe to know that water does not return.
"When the incision of your operation has been completed and you have made a small cut in the abdomen to remove the phlegm, return it immediately and put aside the two fingers used for this purpose on the patient's belly button.
"If the wound is infected with another ailment, you will cover it over and extract it immediately, then treat it as instructed.
"If the water is divided into two parts, you will know that both are halves of it; so divide that part also in the same way if it's your turn to pour.
"Firstly, keep the cloth soaked in oil or another oily substance. Then submerge it into a container with water and oil mixture, expand it over both thighs and the stomach area; place it on top of towels and powder to avoid any damage.
"Use two moistened towels in this manner: one towel will go over the buttocks and the other on the thighs. The first will be spread out to cover the anal area and the second for covering the scrotum, making sure it covers both sides equally.
This sentence refers to the surgical treatment of a hernia using a cautery tool. The surgeon will make an incision in the appropriate location and apply the cautery on it. They recommend a subtle cautery technique that should be applied directly onto the wound, and once this is done... ...the Greek letter alpha (A)
Once the wound has been made, it is recommended to remove all moisture from it.
Remove the cautery once you have finished with it and ensure that the wound is well-cleansed, removing any residual cautery gently. If necessary, remove all of the cautery from the wound to prevent any further burns.
You know that this operation is both safe and lengthy in terms of time, and preferable over other operations on the section.
Do not apply the cautery before making an incision or after it has been applied for fear of causing harm to the wound as you should take care when applying any treatment on this matter and choose according to what was said.
If the patient is afraid and does not want a second operation due to its horrific nature, they should administer an incision once you recommend it as this indicates that such a hernia will heal properly.
When a patient is in need of an incision to be made on the upper part of their thigh, first prepare the incision area by placing gauze over it and perform the cut at the lower point of the chest, holding your hand down for support while making the cut.
This sentence means "If you open a large space to drain all the water.
Place your hand over that area and hold it there while making a cut through which the wound will drain. After making the incision, care for the wound by applying gauze to seal any gaps and prevent further bleeding.
If you do not find a suitable needle or instrument to extract the water from that place where it is oozing out, put gauze over the area and seal any gaps, or if there's no need for it because of its small size - in this case you can just leave it untouched.
If the water returns and becomes abundant, make a second incision so that the patient's days will be over sooner rather than later.
The thirty-third chapter of the book.
This section deals with the cure for a hernia and how to operate on it.
In this section about hernias, there is advice to avoid harm and the use of great caution in making incisions on large areas; for I see the discharge of it and its being saved by that means.
The operation should be remembered in that place and the specifications of the stitches.
Then say that the stitches are located in the joints where they cause pain and are caused by cold humors infiltrating each part of the body, or by acute excess fat, which is found in the joints, or by gout.
The color of the stitches should match the skin's color and not cause pain; the stitches are considered severe.
A very dark stitch is called a lapidated one, whose color is black, and it does not match with the skin's color.
Some vegetables are put in to prevent the swelling of the veins or to remember that place where it was applied.
This means that the swelling of veins is caused by the removal of the stitches when you apply it on those places mentioned, and not to touch it.
This means that the swelling from veins is prevented by compression in that place mentioned without any need for removing stitches, and you should avoid compressing it elsewhere.
It is possible that in this case the stitches should be removed and replaced with other ones; also to indicate which joints you have cut into, and apply those on the affected areas of your hands, remove it from the back bone, dissolve the suspension cord for veins, tie them, and insert the suspension cord over all of them.
"When a patient's bowels have been opened, then you should extract that which is in them.
"If there is no specific cause or between those that are between the bowels, then you should remove all of that adhesion and insert a round incision.
"If the adhesion is in a location behind where it should be, then you should remove all of that adhesion and extract the bowels as well.
"Once your operation is complete, you should apply a poultice of warm, moist dressing to it and give another treatment for any injuries that may occur.
"Chapter 14 ends here.
"From the care of hernia, which is to be discussed later.
"The hernia is closed with a band similar to the one used for strangulation of testicles, making it difficult to move and walk around.
"In caring for this illness there is a fear that precedes its remembrance.
"However, the operation should be done in reverse order to those first.
"Then say that you should make the patient lie on an elevated board; and put under his testicles the cushion of the scrotum as well; and place your knees at the side to hold in the bowels so they do not come out; and have these other ministers who will attend to him, and extend them with great effort.
When you have made incisions on both sides of the chest, it is customary to open the ribs from below so that they can be seen.
And you'll remove everything related to the incisions made on top of your temples.
You will insert a fine needle through which to be true double, and place it in the first of the areas mentioned earlier, and put another one farther away from there. You will make incisions in that part of the body for a second time along its length, and remove anything added from the contaminated and putrid fluids.
You will cure the blisters with care of all the other blisters in which you wish to be born through so that they may emerge from the pores where only one of two generations are not harmful for this purpose.
If all the blisters have come out, then remove them completely or cut off those that emerge from this hole of the pores, for it is private to any nourishment for the incision and should be treated, unless they are already treated.
Chapter 55.
Of the cure of an inguinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a slit that extends over the stomach from an opening in the navel area, for which you must remove the intestine through this slit and place it back into its cavity.
When this rupture occurs in the diaphragm or excrement passage of the body, these two symptoms occur due to the following causes: impact, or friction, or loud noise, or elevation of a heavy thing, or resemblance.
When it is caused by the excrement passage, this occurs very little and far apart in short times, without exception; and if there are any pains in the stomach, they will be relieved through a cure for that.
When it is caused by obstruction of the excrement passage, at first pain occurs very suddenly and violently; and that's why they put an end to the cause, making the body to release pressure from the abdomen.
Sometimes a swelling is caused by the intestine being squeezed tightly against the skin; and it's called this intestinal hernia.
Sometimes swelling is caused by a hernia being pushed out; and here it's considered one of the worst misfortunes for the patient, some swellings cause bad and severe pain when pressed.
In the treatment of these ailments it is best to be afraid that you will miss the cure in this case.
The procedure of this operation is that you command the patient to place their hand over the abdomen at the lowest part of her waist if he/she feels sick again; and after it's done place your hand between hers and elevate her legs.
When the anus is to be washed with hot water, first put a cloth between its parts and wash it thoroughly until clean, then dry with a towel; afterwards, apply a medicine or ointment to prevent any discomforts caused by this action.
If you are able to do so after the anus has been cleaned thoroughly and dried, then it can be gently wiped with a dry cloth or paper towel.
After washing the anus and inspecting it for any tears, one should wipe clean each part of it with a white cloth or paper towel if necessary.
When washing the anus and inspecting it for tears, you must first wash the bowel, then inspect each tear for any remaining debris in its cavity, after which you should thoroughly clean the remaining area behind the tear.
After cleaning the anus and inspecting it for tears, you must first cleanse the bowel thoroughly from left to right with the white cloth on your left hand side, then inspect each tear for any remaining debris in its cavity, after which you should clean the remaining area behind the tear. Finally, have a minister extend their hand over both of them, remove their hands gently and thoroughly remove all adhering moisture that may remain behind as a solution is applied.
After cleaning the anus and inspecting it for tears, you must ensure there was no cause of the bowel to be caught within the tear itself, as this may indicate an issue that needs further investigation or treatment. When a stomach ulcer occurs without an obvious cause, then place it in the belly of the patient.
Insert into the opening of the diaphragm as you would normally do in this case that we recommend.
Apply a soaked thread in oil, and place it as we recommend (and sometimes the diaphragm is cauterized, which has been advised to prevent any leakage of blood, or at least put pressure on it until you can).
When the time comes to administer it (the medicine), the doctors may pour water on it and hold their breath until they say so.
They will next apply another treatment for those ulcers, if necessary.
Chapter sixty-six
Ventricular hernia.
In this kind of hernia, there is not a need for surgery to heal it.
The first doctors would suggest doing the same thing they recommended for the hernia that was mentioned earlier in the passage - hold their breath and press on that part where there is weakness to prevent it from coming out of its cavity.
After saying so, apply another treatment if necessary.
Chapter sixty-seven
Of the disease that affects both lungs.
Certain vessels end up breaking in the lung areas as well, causing damage to it.
There should not be any causes of hernias coming from the intestines either way; and if there are some, it is a rare occurrence, and it returns itself over time.
If the time is prolonged and a tear in the pericardium occurs where the hernia should come out of it, this causes the pericardium to expand and place pressure on that area as well, causing pain there too. The physician will then apply cold compress after another until the patient feels better
The cure for it proceeds as soon as its history has been recorded.
After the patient's thighs have been opened and a cushion placed under them, tighten their legs so that they are pulled back towards you as much as possible without breaking any stitches or tearing open an organ near to your level of comfort (second part is unclear).
After having tightened the thighs, gently stretch their calves towards you while keeping them as close together as possible without uncovering any stitches or tearing open an organ near to your level of comfort.
After stretching the calves and ensuring that they are close together, hold their calves in this position while moving them gently towards you on the abdomen.
After placing both calves into this prominent position of the calf, tighten one stitch at each of them together.
After stretching the calf but not pulling it all the way out or extending the hand in any other direction that might cause harm to the intestine healing process, proceed with the cure of an inguinal hernia.
After curing that and marking the wounds with incision, cleanse it and restore the flap within which is consolidated; as you stretch the calf without adjusting its prominence of rupture.
Cure him here, as this position promotes health.
Chapter 58 (end).
The relief of a swollen scrotum
You should massage the swollen scrotum until it is relieved and warmed up by massaging the legs between them as well, after which you will feel relief in that area
When necessary, you should apply cold compresses to the scrotum only on its own side and wrap it around the natural scrotum; then adjust two fingers over the stitches.
If you wish to further compress the swollen scrotum with three or four gauze pads tightly wrapped around and firmly on top of the stitches.
You should also insert a needle between the stitches, then perform the treatment to ensure that all the wounds are closed and can be felt no longer.
The 59th chapter is complete.
Castration.
It is known that castration in our law is excluded, except for certain cases where it is necessary to remember it here so as to understand the doctor when he asks about this matter; and the other purpose is to ensure that we must castrate any of these animals young ones among us who are able to mate, and also pigs and goats.
Castration occurs in two manners: either by traction or through a cut
When castrated by traction, the method of operation is to cut off the foreskin inside so that both testicles are softened and lined up, and they hang down. The approach taken here is to remove it gently without making any cuts.
When castrated by cutting and tearing, you will have the penis held in place between the testicles of the patient with a hand on either side.
The suspenders are tightened and incisions made to ensure that both tubes remain separate
When castrated, the incision is made below the scrotum. Nothing else is mentioned except for the use of a catheter which is placed in the urethra.
The method of castration through traction is superior to that done through cutting and tearing as the foreskin can still cause harm to the testicles if it becomes detached.
After surgery, care must be taken so that the wound heals properly.
The end of the text
From curing hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in humans occurs in two ways: one is when there are only external genitals between the testicles, and another is where a pair of female-like genitals appear that are both present.
When urine flows from a certain part of the body called the urethra
In women, there is something special: when the urethra of the female body is opened slightly like this, urine will also flow from both testicles downward.
The cure consists of three stages: two for men and one for women. It is necessary to insert those pointed sticks into that part of the body where they will be used for treatment and then apply the cure to both the affected areas separately.
In the second stage of men's treatment when urine flows from the urethra as in the testicles there is neither cure nor operation involved.
The end.
For women to undergo a minor surgery and have them removed due to various reasons.
Minor surgery can be done in a natural way, which involves the use of a pointed stick inserted into the urethra and then pulling it out gently to prevent any damage; in women, it may also include the use of a cushion placed between the thighs as well.
If you have excess of minor surgery and want to remove them or any kind, then insert it into your hand or arm.
Last but not least: in such cases where there is a risk of bleeding during the procedure, it should be performed as close to the edge as possible to minimize any potential blood flow.
And apply the treatment to be given when they are healed
A new flesh is the skin that appears in place of a larger one when it becomes full and swells; therefore, if you want to apply this treatment, call us for it as we would be pleased to assist you with this ("malignant ulcer").
[No translation provided]
For the cure of dermatitis.
If a small hole is not made in her vagina, or if it has already been perforated, It can be either natural or accidental
If caused by malignant ulcers as mentioned earlier, and if it is not sutured properly, or through a small incision made in the flesh,
It is also used to remove the larger ulcer from under it, or from between its ribs (the sternum), or from beneath its breasts, or from beneath its buttocks, and is forbidden for cutting into any part of it that extends beyond this limit, and very severely prohibits any attempt at incision or castration, and is strictly prohibited against cutting into it in a manner other than specified.
The knowledge of it is to be acquired by acquaintance with the art, if obvious; otherwise, you must ask about it in terms of the specified measures or procedure.
When done gently, it will be removed by these two blades
And place the soft towels over the two thin thighs, and arrange them in a position to cover the buttocks.
The woman should lie on her back with the two wide thighs exposed, and arrange them to cover the buttocks in a position so that the gentle removal of the blades occurs without the need to further remove the pain.
Then take a cloth and wipe off any excess oil and place it over that area, and put something soft under it to keep it from sticking.
If the blade is thick or heavy, the doctor will tell you that you should use a blunt one to prevent injury.
If the removal occurs through flesh, it is customary to support it with something soft and secure it.
If there are medicines that can stop the flow of bleeding and clotting, for example aspirin or anticoagulants, adjust as per instructions in the book.
Then use a broad needle to prevent it from sticking during application.
Let the medicine be applied regularly over several days, or as directed by your doctor.
Then ensure that any other injuries are properly treated so they do not heal incorrectly.
In some cases, joints ache in early infancy due to cold humors that invade every part of the body, and foot pain occurs then it is commonly called gout by doctors If the abscess is already opened in any part of the body except for the groin, it cannot be closed again with this method.
Chapter 33
Of the cure for hemorrhoids and lymphedema of the leg or arm that occurs in connection with menstruation.
Hemorrhoids are often caused by veins that continue to narrow and cause the veins to become obstructed continuously, and when hemorrhoids occur as a result of them being inflamed.
He then divided the species from those with healing and those without, saying that
Hemorrhoids are not cured when the pain is at its worst and does not subside over time, and the hemorrhoids in those cases should not be treated.
Those who have a lump where they ache severely but are cured are called healed sores.
And for those who use the female in such a way that causes her pain or discomfort, and those that cause harm to her body parts, it is necessary to avoid them.
And in applying powders that contain the active ingredient of a remedy for sores from the pestilence as mentioned earlier to these sores, so too with other such remedies.
When you put a cushion underneath them [the patient's legs], after that time has elapsed, then place your hand gently on their chest.
If the flow of blood continues, then do as follows: apply a mixture of equal parts of wine and vinegar to the affected areas near the groin and below the knee, and also on the elbows and under the arms.
After you have put a cushion underneath them [the patient's legs], then take flour, honey, vinegar and water and make it into paste, apply this to both their thighs.
If the ailment has been cured completely, then you may move on; if not, follow this: apply honey and vinegar to both breasts.
After you have put a cushion underneath them, then take water mixed with aloe vera or vinegar and apply it to the area as well. Then cover the area gently in order for it to be healed completely.
Cure [the patient] completely so they may be healed
Chapter twenty-four
Damage to the liver through an accident.
The specific symptoms of an abscess occur in the liver: they are a lump, ulceration and inflammation around it, perforation, fistulas and aneurysms, and other abscesses. These are the maladies of those people in that division
You can consult in this treatise the particular way that each operation is done, and if you want to know how
When joint pain first occurs and is accompanied by sharp shock, trembling, and fever, it may be a sign of gout that needs immediate attention from the doctor to prevent worsening.
After removing the female from her seat on the bench and placing her on the floor near your feet, recline her body towards the ground and adjust her legs to be close to the abdomen, with her thighs spread apart and her arms resting.
After removing the female, direct your attention to the instrument with which you will open up the main part of it, and form its shape based on those causes that are expected to be performed.
When you want to administer this instrument, put your finger over the main part of the woman's body and into it gently but firmly, so that the instrument goes into her vagina without being larger than its own size and causing harm to the patient. When the greater tool is larger than usual, then it is customary to place powders on the surface of the greater tool so that it prevents all other tools from coming into contact with it
Then the minister will take the tool, and it is customary to roll up any powder that might be on the surface of the greater tool so as to ensure that there are no impurities from the larger object interfering with its use
After a cut has been made on the palm and it bleeds, then it is customary to apply pressure to stop the bleeding
If the veins are evacuated, then it is customary to place a cloth submerged in hot oil or fat so that there is no stickiness on it, and put it over the affected area of greater importance.
Place a cloth submerged in water that has been boiled so as to be scalding hot on the greater area, and then put it over the affected part of lesser importance.
Then do two days after you have applied a poultice so that when it is convenient to do so, this will be a cure.
Then wash the greater and the lesser vessels separately with warm water until they are clean, and apply them to the water that has been boiled so as to be scalding hot, then return to the original place.
When the bladder is empty and you want to prevent any urination from occurring, hold that area as instructed above.
Chapter LXXV
To teach the midwives to attend upon those who show unnatural figures
It is necessary for the midwife to observe at first the figure of a newborn as such through its ears because when she sees the woman trying to vomit or wanting to feel pain in her chest, and from this it is learned that this part is a natural figure, and also the vomiting up over the belly button, and suspending or holding back the umbilical cord.
When you see those signs, the midwife understands that the belly of the baby is compressed in such a way that the embryo will descend more when it descends over its head, so loosen it gently and then bind it again, as this is beneficial for a good outcome.
If this part is another unnatural and untestable one, when the embryo comes out from its body and the baby's body is over its head and its legs, or if it comes out of the belly button and hand, or if it comes out of the head and belly, then it will be twisted around to the side.
When the cause of labor pains is known to be due to the mother being wise and subtle in all those causes
That figure will also show which one of these is meant by this and be placed on that place
When the urine is excreted through an external opening because of a natural process, it is very painful for women and is difficult to pass; sometimes, urination may be difficult due to its tightness and many women have this problem.
Between the second and third fingers on her right hand, place a small cloth to prevent any moisture from coming into contact with that area. Press down on the abdomen of the woman until she gives birth to it
If not, the doctor will recommend that the woman undergo a cervical mucus and fetal fibronectin test.
Command the doctor to perform an amniocentesis procedure, and place a bandage on his chest so that he does not disturb during pregnancy; also put her mouth and nose with tape for one hour as the fetus will be monitored constantly.
If both of the fetus' legs are immediately affected with weakness, then the doctor will recommend reducing these gradually When the belly is not heavy and the pain subsides on a cushion underneath them, support their legs with another servant, place it under them as well, holding their hands to prevent dropping of the cushion or service.
If the feet do not separate and die after this occurs in the belly or in the chest to the hand of the patient is spread out and extended as well, and if it does not happen that way
When the child is placed on their back, have it pushed over towards them, and gently turn the child onto its stomach, and then put your hand underneath to support it, and then slowly roll the baby up little by little.
When it comes out of the cavity into the thighs, have them push it outward, and hold down its chin to prevent it from retracting, unless God wills otherwise.
If you do not agree with what has been recommended, then have them roll back into the fetal position until it is in its normal position again, unless otherwise dictated by God.
If it is prohibited altogether what has been recommended, have them remove their clothes and wet the mortar with dissolved lime, and then apply this to the forehead of the patient, place a bit under their lower abdomen as well. "Take away this feverish sweat from under his armpits.
"Occasionally, when the limbs are weakened, place him gently and support it in that way. "When the sub-fumigation lasts for an hour, place a cushion under his head and support him in that way. Then gently stroke his face and open his mouth, take away from there, and press down on the belly button with gentle pressure to make it stop.
Holding their hand Place the first servant on her arm above mentioned.
If that is not possible, the servant will be placed above her thigh and the muscles of his arms will be stimulated violently in order to administer the gout remedy recommended by doctors.
If the previous method is insufficient, place the servant above her waist and instruct him to bend his second figure naturally while supporting her body with his arm; order him to enter into position as soon as possible so that he can easily reach what needs to be reached.
Place the servant's hand on her stomach, ensuring it is above her navel and at right angles to her side. Ensure that the mistress has the servant's arm, and instruct him to slowly move it in small circles, making sure he is agile.
Once you've done that and placed the servant where recommended by doctors for oil and ointments, pause over his chest in order to administer what was suggested by doctors as a remedy for gout.
Instruct him to gently move it in small circles until you're finished, then place the servant on one knee and order him to lower himself while supporting his head with his hand; do this slowly so that he is not injured. The fetus descends from above
When dealing with a horrific illness of the second kind, consider this and the doctor will recommend that you instill the second one into your urethra while it is being evacuated from the moisture
If the fetus is suspended over the face and head of them, then you should instill that one into their urethra to prevent it from being retained and rotting.
Then place the fetus at the opening of the second kind in and ask for someone to check it periodically; if necessary remove it immediately with extreme urgency, as God wills it
The exit or death of twins or many fetuses Know that twins often have different needs and sometimes three or four are necessary to achieve a result; may be because of nature's causes or not live
If they are twins or multiples, the first one is separated and the second one through a cannula inserted into their umbilical vein; sometimes you may need to remove both if there's an emergency situation like this, so eggs as well as some are removed by removing
If there's difficulty or obstruction in bringing the fetus out and you suspect unnatural figures, the doctor will suggest this as they described it.
When the gentlewoman is ready to proceed gently and subtly, slowly and cautiously, with ingenuity being used as a whole figure from which she proceeds when it comes prepared by an engine tending towards health
The remembrance of this forms in the matrix out of the embryos and are aborted
Some women's vagina is formed in the great one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and many others X, who is a cause of death due to measurement of glory holes.
And therefore in the science of the gentlewoman who is very light and to that extent similar to this, and therefore stop yourself from doing it.
Chapter 66
The extraction of the dead body when done.
When you care for a dead body as we have said in the division of medicine and it is not forbidden to do so, use your own operation as much as possible, taking into account whether or not the woman is healthy and free from accidents that she may be afraid to suffer loss.
The ladies place a cloth on the head of the body and put their own hands in order to hold its head up and raise her legs.
The minister shall have that from both parts, or be laid in the line to prevent the extension of his body towards the outside
You will lubricate the mouth of the bigger one with oil and mucus, then grease and feather it
Lubricate the arms of the woman with oil and mucus, then grease her larger arm and secure it tightly in place so that its tips do not come out of the body
Where it is appropriate: If the body is prepared to send over its head, then place them in the hands of him, or in his collar, or in his mouth, or on his palate, or do not shave his beard, or at the base of his spine, or in any of the indentations between the ribs.
If it is necessary to send them down onto the feet, then put them on his back or in the groove of his ribs.
You should have the left arm in front and stop its curve at that location between the two breasts of her right side, enter it into the hollow of his body where you mentioned them earlier, so they may extend toward the buttocks
Place another arm or the third if needed to make sure it is fixed securely, and not extended beyond its proper location only
When pain occurs in joints caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and pain occurs in feet, it is customary to call gout by doctors.
When you return the intestine to its cavity and it is not retained inside, remove the restraint with a pointed cautery and turn it around so that it enters as quickly as possible into the cavity where it was previously held.
If the part of the body has been removed, then turn it inside out so that everything is as before.
If the hand is separated from the other and it cannot be rejoined by coartation of the body part, then wrap it around that; and arrange it so that everything is as before, or in the joint of the hand or at the cavity.
And do this with both hands.
If the head of the body is big or if you want to make an incision in it, or if the neck is adjusted so that its opening faces forward, doctors say put it between two pointed things and pull out both ends of the skin, or use a tool called "alundat" which has the form of other tools mentioned above.
"When the pain is due to a large swelling by nature; and if its cause can be determined as an abscess or ulcer that causes pain in the same place, then apply pressure with a pair of tweezers.
"If the swelling is internal and surrounded by muscle, then take a damp cloth to apply gentle pressure on the affected area.
"If it is not complicated or burdensome, then try to puncture the swelling as soon as possible.
"If there is a hernia in the abdomen or it protrudes downwards towards the groin area, then press gently to force the intestine back into its cavity.
"If it is on your foot, then gently lift the affected area and direct its movement towards the mouth of the larger chamber.
"If it is internal and surrounded by muscle, then gently lift the affected area with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and press back into its cavity while making sure that it moves towards this point.
"If the other limbs are affected and turn it towards your arm closest to the larger mouth; if the larger opening is open, then press in with one hand or two hands, depending on which way you would like it to move towards.
When the mouth of the lady is closed by a pointed stick that causes pain to her, the doctors say it's not gout but an abscess on its tongue; however they do administer effusion of humid fluids for reasons. The physicians give emetics to the patient in order to make him vomit and thus cleanse his stomach.
If it is on that side of the body, if possible, do so with caution; and if necessary, administer what we have mentioned to him in his current state.
If it is not possible, the doctors will use pessaries or extractants instead.
Do not give any cause for the second part if they are unable to do so in advance.
When you have completed all your work, the doctors will administer what we mentioned for care in the pointed sticks that cause her pain.
If a fever occurs due to blood, they will give strict purgatives and administer another course of care.
You have found a woman in whose belly was born dead and you are now over the same fire that burned her alive; but if death is caused by another flame, then proceed with different care. It hit him in the elbow joint and inflamed it as if a fire burned through it, and he began to put on bandages
When you call for healing of him, and care for him for a long time, the disease does not become consolidated.
After placing gauze over his entire body except for the head and genitals, you are also to remove one hand, wait a while, then another hand. And if it is not relieved through the belly opening, there will be other means taken as well.
After you have given him all possible treatments and care for a long time, think about using bones of dead children
Therefore you have to consider using the bones of dead children as part of your treatments for a long time; in addition to these, there are other bones available from various sources that can be used, depending on how much time you want to invest.
You are not alone in your struggle; many doctors also seek to help with care and treatment of this nature.
The forms that the instruments necessary for the extraction of the body parts are being prepared.
Form of truth which is above all others:
This form of strength to which all people are equal; and in both extremities of two feet there are two virtues. Even this virtue may be pushed by subtle restraint, or by the use of rope, or a fist, depending on circumstances.
When you've identified the joints affected by gout and located where the pain occurs in them (for example, feet), a physician would typically call it gout because:
The second sentence translates to "and the two openings are into the mouth, so that it is covered up when you rotate the two prescribed vices.
Another way of saying this in a more subtle and less explicit manner.
It is customary to make incisions with the help of the blades or fingers, depending on the appearance desired. The first sentence is "May I place them at the end of his body twice, and the length of these incisions is like that of a palm, while the width of each one is equal to two digits.
When you want to raise the heel, place a cushion under their thighs and lift it between the patient's legs. You take your hand and place it on the tool just as you would with a pair of forceps, according to how much you want for raising the heel into which direction you wish
The manner in which they used to do things in the past.
This is how one should act when trying to expel something:
How one should behave while trying to hold back the large head.
When using a pair of forceps on the limb in question, sometimes with caution and sometimes carefully, some people always use them with careful precision to stop the bleeding. How to act when trying to expel something quickly:
How to treat a spine wound:
When dealing with multiple spine wounds.
When dealing with both limbs severed at the head.
How to act when you are dealing with two amputations of the same type on opposite sides of your body.
When using these instruments, and when more varieties of the same type are prepared to be used, and you want to perform surgery on multiple patients, or if you have that many patients to deal with, use them according to their amount.
Do not use these instruments when the need for them is not acceptable.
After making a second incision.
When the second incision is made, tell the surgeon to remove the patient's head and place your hand over his mouth and nose, if necessary, so that you can breathe for him, and if not possible, do it quickly with a sternum press or other means available
When the joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and when pain occurs in the feet These herbs or some other may be submerged in water, and placed on fire
Then insert a cannula into the mouth of the patient, ensuring that any discharge will enter the cavity of the patient's nose.
And then, follow these instructions as quickly as possible.
And then proceed with caution and do not miss it, the doctor commands the nurse to submerge his left hand in olive oil or in micellar water, and place this into the wound and wait until the second one arrives, and when they both arrive, the doctor takes out that little by little. The bandages are applied to both right and left hands easily.
If the patient's mouth is closed, we already recommended the procedure to be performed and medical treatment with herbs.
When there are multiple causes of joint pain and those causes have been identified, please keep in mind that this procedure should only be performed once for each cause, even if more than one cause is present
Please raise the patient's head and stomach as well, let that be done with caution and care.
Please administer the old remedies by inserting a needle or lancet into the nose or ear canal to drain phlegm or pus from there, as needed.
The instrument through which women are subjected to fumigation should retain the urine of the first and second menstruation period.
It is necessary, or not
Please hold the delicate extremity near the face and the broad extremity over the flame, and stop the fumigation on both hands.
Please have that procedure repeated if needed.
The anus of the child should not be perforated.
Please do not pierce or lacerate any part of a child's body, especially delicate areas and lips. Please avoid piercing or lacerating the abdomen of any patient unless absolutely necessary and if possible, perforate that area just below it, keeping in mind to not touch anything sharp.
When pain occurs in a limb due to cold humors that have infiltrated into it, doctors typically call this gout
This means "If you are worried about an abscess, then pause in applying a needle to drain it.
This means "When an abscess occurs in the anus from hemorrhoids or piles, and when that consolidation is infected, then it should be treated with care as prescribed by the doctor.
This sentence can mean different things depending on what comes next, but one possible translation could be "The cure of fistulae wounds.
This translates to: "Fistulas that develop at the entrance of the body are usually small and coarse, those found in the anus or area around it.
This could mean either "it is a fistula" or "it's a wound," depending on what follows next in the text.
This means "If that wound is old and infected with white or powdery moisture, then some of these fistulae may penetrate.
This translates to: "Those which penetrate are known for being able to exit and make openings in the body; some veins may be used for exit only, while others burst easily.
This translates to: "Some of those fistulae are located in the space between the bladder and scrotum, or between the anus and rectum; some penetrate into the joints and into the veins.
The first sentence translates to: In the case of a fistulous opening penetrating and non-penetrating, it is recommended that you make an incision in the anus with extreme care so as not to rupture the fistula
If there is a rupture involved, it is recommended to introduce the fistulas through a cannula in order to feel or probe for the passage into the external opening.
If there is no issue at all or if the fistula does not cause any discharge, vomiting, or other problems, then it may be non-penetrating, and you should seek medical attention.
If the fistulous opening penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, then its meaning is discharge of urine from that area and it should be treated as such so that the medical location has been established.
If the fistulous opening penetrates into the joint or into the penis and causes pain in the circuit, then its meaning is that it can penetrate here if there is not rupture of the fistula at the anus, causing pain along the course; it needs further treatment; and it should be avoided for medical attention as it has not been established.
For all those fistulas that are non-curative and the treatment of which is uncertain from the perspective of the physicians who have seen it, then it should be treated with caution as there may be no medical solution found for this specific condition.
When pain occurs in the feet
The patient has already had the opening made between their thighs and placed a cushion beneath them, another servant is positioned above their legs, and another one over their chest, holding their hands.
If the patient feels a lump between their buttocks, say that you have made an incision in the bowel.
If you feel that the lump is penetrating, then it may be a hernia or cancer between your thighs and the anus.
However, please also note that healthy skin has elasticity, so any new lump could potentially be harmless.
In the surgery for which the opening is made, you should gently insert a cautery needle into the fistula's lumen, as previously mentioned, and remove it from the bowel; repeat this three times or more until you are sure all those tightened fistulas have been opened up properly to resemble a candle wick.
After all those tightened fistulas have been opened up, and after any other necessary surgeries are done, if it is healthy then good, otherwise there will be more treatments required.
"When someone tries to penetrate the anus, and it does not penetrate into the rectum as expected due to a fistula or cyst in that area, sometimes the surface of the anal canal is dry up. The doctor will then apply something to lubricate the fissure so that penetration can be attempted again.
"The surgeon must remove any fistula that resembles an abscess and does not heal on its own, causing the skin to be damaged.
"In cases where a fistula occurs between your hands and the operation when cleaning those parts, it is customary to use an instrument for cauterizing with heat or cold, as appropriate. The abscess should be treated using heat or cold application.
"The abscess should be treated with a compress soaked in warm water or hot oil applied to the affected area, and after several days of treatment it should heal and become hard.
"In cases where the abscess is dry and exsiccated, when it has been restored to its normal condition there will be no further treatment required.
"If the fistula has perforated into the perineum and extends to the surface of the body, the doctor will examine it in that area.
If you find cold humors between the thigh and your elbow, it is advisable to penetrate them with confidence and hope for success
One of three methods to administer it: cauterize them as you have previously mentioned; dissect the hernia in order to remove it through a possible entrance and provide necessary care; or stretch the cloth over the anus, similar to what has been said before, using an instrument with a sharp extremity, making sure that all fistulas are opened up for inspection. After applying this method, if the obstruction persists, and the fistula is still open in the anal area, then perform the procedure on the patient's buttocks. After the fistula has been finished through this method: when you enter it into the fistula, and there is a space between the buttocks and the surface of the body near the margin of the anus. The doctor will then take an instrument with a sharp point to make a hole in order to inspect all fistulas at once.
When entering into the fistula through a small hole, it is necessary to go slowly and carefully in order for the hernia to be removed successfully.
When you are to penetrate the rectum and insert your penis into it, first remove any foreign object that may be inside there; remove the end of the sheath, adjust both ends, tighten each one separately, hold for 1-2 days depending on the pain level if anything is inserted in the flesh.
And once the pouch has been consolidated and healed
If the fistula orifice is not penetrable, do not penetrate it unless otherwise instructed by your doctor, but rather treat with caution as if there were an open sore; and once healed, take care to keep clean.
The shape of the pouch depends on whether it is formed from a fistulous deformity (which has an acute curvature and one non-acute part) or a normal pouch; if you suspect there may be a fistula without knowing for certain, do not insert anything into this region unless necessary.
Suture the hemorrhoids in such cases running through the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are often grouped into two types: external hemorrhoids appearing as protruding lumps around the anus and internal hemorrhoids swelling up inside of them. And from those are small and large, the pain that arises from them is sudden and severe, but moderate in some cases, and falls away after defecation or urination, in the extremities of it.
When the buttocks are very dry due to low humidity and water content of which is citric acid or a small amount of salt continuously present on the body
The urgency is that you ask the patient to lie down and explain what happens if it comes out or if there is any swelling in the buttocks When you want to cut off circulation and support his back with your hand or arm, then move the fingers of that hand towards the patient's side.
If there are no veins in the area due to low humidity and softening of that tissue, then put a gauze or cloth soaked in alcohol on it, and move it gently towards a cautery; or if you have already done so as described before for cauterizing, continue doing so The next procedure is to apply another cure in order to heal them
If the buttocks are obese and prevent ejaculation from occurring when they are pressed down on, then apply a small knife to the wound in that area so it can cut through the flesh and prevent ejaculation from coming out.
If the hemorrhoids are in the buttocks area and you want to treat them with a finger or hand, then press on those areas; if it is necessary to use another part of your body for treatment, then apply that instead. And continue the procedure as described before to heal them.
"And whoever inserts a needle must remember to administer the second dose at that same place: apply a clean bandage and wrap around it with thread, so as to prevent it from passing through another part of her body; and if it penetrates in one direction then cover both holes made by wrapping them up.
"And do all of this: leave some open and not close others, to prevent the overflow from that part flowing into another.
"Place a bandage soaked in warm oil or vinegar over the anus and then place one on top of it, to tell the patient when to pause. "And after that: put a bandage in and then wait until it is completely dry or covered with another bandage to be safe.
"And if those are old and not treatable by that medicine: remember to use them in conjunction with moist bandages or compresses from these areas to prevent any further consolidation. And after they are consolidated you should apply them.
When pain arises in the first joint, severe and fiery
If you know how to relieve gout attacks by using cold remedies alone, it is important; otherwise, if only heat treatments are used instead of color treatments, you will need to seek medical attention for those pains.
If the gout attack has infiltrated the veins or arteries and is removed from its place, then it must be cured.
Then, cauterize as mentioned in the previous sentence if you wish to do so.
A small pimple on the surface of the body will often cause pain in many children.
The cure for it is to spread and infiltrate that thing, or to cut off that part of the body altogether. If you wish to do so as mentioned earlier, apply heat or an acute treatment (like a blister).
A small pimple on the surface of the body will often cause pain that makes you want to squeeze it or pick at it until it breaks open and causes a pus-filled boil.
"You should insert a needle with pain or thirst, and hold it over the rim of the cup so that it contains the liquid in the flow through its circuit; then release your hand from around the cup to indicate that you have finished drinking.
"If you wish, lay down a straw and proceed as follows:
"Make it narrow at the tip, soundless (non-perforated), covered so that you know when its opening is blocked and replaced.
"If you wish to cauterize the ulcer in the same way as for arteries, then cauterize it at the tip of a cautery.
"From among the instruments that are used by doctors:
"Some cauteries are made of silver or bronze or iron; and some cauteries are small ones used for the treatment of children's burns, which one is administered to treat children's burns.
"The form of large ones (large cauteries):
"The top of the needle's point, where you will place a bag wide enough in this manner.
The extremity of him is introduced in the anus, which cannot be unseen by anyone, it causes great irritation; and on one side there are two ulcers, and on the other side one ulcer, and these ulcers become larger as the days go on
The bag in which the bladder medicines of beast or sheep are placed is dry and rough
It is perforated by sharp ulcers, which turn it around like this; if there is space between the ulcers then its surface will be rough
Stretch the bag tightly between two strong strings like this, adjust it so that the mouth of the chest is between two sharp corners; and when it is placed on him, stretch it over his chest as much as possible, without causing too much pain or being too tight
Stretch the patient out onto his back, raise up their legs and place one hand over this area or another, and stretch it to remove the ulcer from its base into the chest; and extend the ulcer and the patient away from each other.
When medicine fails to heal that illness completely, then it may be necessary in the future.
If you are going to operate on that illness in the abdomen and its cause, then doctors will use a pointed cautery as treatment.
If in the anus it appears or burns inside the body, then doctors will use a subtle needle and thread, similar to those used for circumcision on children.
For healing of the wounds.
You have already mentioned in the previous part of the healing process that it was customary to follow a free course for treatment, and you mention here that medical treatments should be based on this course as well.
Therefore, the wounds are classified according to whether they were caused by cold humors or other factors affecting their location.
The causes for which the wounds are caused by cold humors or other factors affecting their location will be listed here.
The wounds located on the body will be listed here as well, such as those on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and other parts of the body.
This sentence translates to English as: You should apply some plaguings in order to prevent another reasoning and regulation of the subsequent plaguings.
This sentence translates to English as: You should start with simple plagues, and then recall the complex ones will begin at the third capital.
This sentence translates to English as: When you encounter a simple plague that hasn't broken it, the doctor considers: if this is for healing or relief, and there has been no bloodletting associated with its application, then apply this potion gently; but if any bleeding occurs, quickly remove the cephalica (a type of poultice used to stop bleeding) from around it.
This sentence translates to English as: And be careful of the opposite of the diseased plague, and keep the patient away from large wounds and from any excessive bleeding.
This sentence translates to English as: If there is no prohibited cause, then the doctor should gently remove the wound and avoid applying it to skin or to blood.
This sentence translates to English as: Upon the plague, if bleeding occurs in or on it, mix oil and vinegar (or any other liquid) with a compress applied gently over it.
This sentence translates to English as: If you are sure of bleeding, then upon the plague apply a compress if it is fresh and the wound has not changed much from what was recommended for application earlier.
When the patient's belly has been made open, put down cushions on either side to keep it from falling in, while someone holds their hands.
If the wound is large or gaping and cannot be closed with stitches due to risk of infection, then doctors adjust it to close later after making a separate incision for sutures.
If the belly wound is visible and gaping, then doctors insert something to keep it open until healing is complete, making an incision for sutures as well in order to close it later on in another place, so that the flesh is stitched up correctly there while preventing waste from accumulating: heads and forms should be straight and similar.
If the belly wound becomes rotten or adheres to the abdomen, then doctors cut through it and remove it, treating the affected area as necessary.
If the belly wounds are arteries or veins through which blood can flow, and not closed by medicine, doctors inquire about it to determine if they should remove it in order to prevent bleeding: if it is clear that it cannot be removed, then cauterize it so that bleeding stops before it is cut.
If the belly wounds are simple and small, then their cause is easy to find: you can simply powder them over there with this powder, making sure that it settles down on those wounds before the wound of the belly heals completely.
The first sentence means: "The recipe for treating the patient's ailment is to apply a poultice once every day, and to change dressings three times; it should consist of linen well-padded with vinegar and strained cloth tightly bound around the afflicted part so that they do not loosen or separate from one another.
"The goal is to strain these poultices as tight as possible and leave them in place until they become so hardened that they cannot be torn apart by the patient's movements.
"It should not only involve applying poultices when there is also pain in the affected areas and legs.
"The procedure is performed on large wounds when it has been observed that the poultice has remained in place for a long time and shows signs of hardening.
"If the poultice has become damp and is becoming soft due to high temperatures, you should not apply it in its usual position as described earlier. Instead, you can place them on their chest or back between clean cloth and water to prevent infection.
"If the poultice breaks in half but is still small enough, you can remove it gently.
When fractures occur in the head
Of the hemorrhoids of the lower part
When a hemorrhoid occurs in the anus, the doctors do not differentiate it from hemorrhoids of the head when simple.
If the nerve of the anus is injured or artery, doctors would treat it as a nerve if simple, but otherwise they would recommend avoiding treatment with strong painkillers and recommending against cutting off that part because it can damage other nerves near to it. And if the hemorrhoids are not caused by any cold humors, but rather by the substance of the nerves being chilled and continued to be so is the cause for this condition in all members.
If it is necessary to use medical ointments, or if you have used a hot water bath without oil and lotion after that, follow these instructions: moisturize the affected area as needed with warm water.
If the hemorrhoids are large, doctors will give stitches or cut out part of the anus and repair it after it is healed.
If a hemorrhoid occurs at the very lowest part of the body, doctors will perform it in that area where possible.
When a patient has opened an artery with bleeding that cannot be stopped, doctors should cut into it to prevent further bleeding.
The doctor should cut into the groin area and save the veins of the colon, sewing over the anus to prevent the intestines from coming out, and place a bandage on it so that it can heal naturally for days; and apply heat or cold as needed to reduce swelling and pain in the affected areas.
If the patient has a wound on their body that needs to be treated quickly due to complications, they should seek medical attention immediately and have any fragments of clothing removed as well; if it is not necessary to apply something to the wound itself, let them know to let doctors deal with it since wounds can become infected easily.
If a patient's wound is recent, they should cover it with powder or something else recommended by the doctor. If a patient's wound is a fistula, doctors should treat it as if they were treating the patient elsewhere in their body.
"If it is a sprain of the ankle or calf muscle, and sometimes deep into them, doctors consider it as potentially fatal.
"If it's not deep and the sprain is recent to them, doctors recommend pausing on that spot for a while, so as to prevent the sprain from returning back into its original depth in the muscle or joint, and to return to the heart if necessary, holding down their hand over the area during this time.
"If the sprain is not at the present, doctors recommend pausing on the surface of the joint and pressing it down gently so that water does not get in between them; and they also place the patient's hand over it to prevent it from coming out.
"If the sprain lasts for three days or more and does not cause any heart problems such as chest pain, muscle spasms, tremors, constriction of airways, or bad feelings that make it difficult to breathe normally, doctors recommend keeping their hand over it while applying cold water and warm compresses until it is healed.
"If the healing of it has been completed and they have already removed their hand from over it, doctors recommend to remove the cushion from above it.
When the abscess is due to strangulation of the throat or chest, and if it's small on the surface of the chest but big elsewhere, doctors cure that with sutures only where necessary, either large or small
If you have already opened the abscess and it is small in one ear but large elsewhere, doctors will drain that abscess and cut away those abscesses if they are separate If the two abscesses are connected, then doctors will drain both of them easily.
Accidents happen in all members at times, and the cure for that which we mentioned is also timely.
Abscesses of the belly.
The discomfort that occurs in the belly is either large or small or moderate.
A small disruption is made difficult by other means, and if the reduction of them is very difficult, unless you prevent their intrusion into that place as much as possible, then they will be difficult to remove because the method of treatment itself becomes difficult.
Therefore, the greatest disruption is moderate, where in that case reduction of the intestine isn't difficult, but it can be very difficult for two other things mentioned.
The incision of the abdomen is second to four layers, many sutures are common in the closure of other organs in the chest.
Two separate incisions specific to that organ commonly join with those of adjacent organs, but no less common in the closure of the abdomen than they are for other organs.
It is advisable to make sure you have made an exposure and declaration as well.
Then it says when the hernia is small and no other cause of the intestine can be found for that one, then there are two ways in which it may occur: either through the weakness of disruption or if coldness of the air has caused it.
When that is the case, you should either compress it with a damp cloth or spray water on it and cover it up, to prevent further inflammation.
Some remedies may include using a compress as that alone can help resolve the inflammation more effectively than just water alone.
Once the inflammation has been resolved, you may gently wet the hernia and cover it with a cloth that is clean and dry as much as possible to prevent further irritation from small causes.
When a gout attack occurs in the joints, you must apply heat to relieve the pain, as directed by doctors.
The first treatment is mild when it is not necessary, and does not require the application of any medication.
Of course! Please provide me with more context or details so I can better assist you in understanding the text.
The first course of treatment should be mild when it is not necessary and does not require the application of any medication; however, in cases where pain is severe or there are complications like pain in the feet, doctors may prescribe other treatments.
If the pain is intensified and unbearable for the patient, doctors may recommend a more gentle approach to their treatment regimen, in their own location if possible, as this could be most beneficial.
When the disruption is widespread and in the lower abdomen, you should place a cushion on either side of their body to support them; if it's in the upper abdomen, hold their head gently and support them as well.
Similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of their stomach, you should support them with their head and arm as well so that the pain in the part where it occurs can be held back more than the other.
When you administer this in great wounds and small wounds
In small wounds pause to administer it and do as follows: place the minister between your thighs so that it holds the whole abdomen tight and adjusts the labia of him/her, and afterwards cover up with a bandage whatever is needed
The common method of suturing: pierce the wound with a needle or count how long it is and make sure to pierce one edge while leaving the other two untouched in order not to damage both ends of the artery; if you miss this part, do not enter through that hole; and then apply four orders.
Stretch firmly in the circle of the needle, and place two stitches between each pair of parts, and sew up the top of the wound with another stitch; stretch out its length by inserting a second needle there, holding it so that it is firm as you start on the first one; do not stop doing this until all the thread around the wound has been used.
Needles should vary in size and delicacy depending on how deep they go into the skin: thin needles are gentler but may pierce more deeply than thick ones.
When the needle is inserted into both extremities of his hand, to prevent injury and for better grip during the stitching process
Sutures should not be prolonged in order to prevent the closure from being prohibited.
The needles are inserted into the extremities of the patient to prevent them from falling asleep during sleep and place a soft pad on top of the stitches, which covers all the extremities with the fingers; and ensure that it is known when the closure has been made.
These types of stitches are used with needles in a way that is most convenient for small wounds where only one or two stitches may be needed around them.
The second stitch is as follows: and you administer the stitches on all four extremities, from the hand to both of his feet, in a single line, with a needle that is tightly wrapped up close to its tip in subtlety and thickness.
Once the needle has entered these four extremities, reduce it from that area which begins first, to prevent the tightly applied pressure on the cloth of subsequent stitches, and ensure that the second stitch in drap is as strong as the first one.
"Place a cushion under each thigh, another servant on their legs, and another one on their chest.
This is the skin of the hand.
This skin was torn from a man in his stomach who had been suffering for 24 hours, and there were tears in the area around two of his fingers where it had ruptured the large vein (the largest in the palm) on both hands and had caused damage to the member; reducing it would prevent further tears.
The wound had been healing for 15 days and over time it had become solid, so reducing it would have made matters worse, but doing so was considered impossible
The other doctors thought it would not heal and so they decided to cover the wound with two gauze pads every day and applied a poultice made of honey for 2 days until it healed
You should apply two pieces of your own skin separately in addition to the previous instructions.
Cut an onion and use its stalk to wrap around
Insert the needle into the onion and wrap around it as much as possible, leaving one end of the onion stalk outside to enter another hole in its other side for the second part
"When you insert it into the body part and cause pain to occur there, doctors usually call this gout.
"And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
"Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
"And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
"Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
"And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
When you put the needle in your right hand at its starting point of injury and advance it to the end, then withdraw both needles from their respective holes; and afterwards revolve the needle and advance it again into both holes on both sides of the wound
Afterwards revolve those cushions and insert one into each of the holes on both sides of the wound; or if it is not in place, put another one in the same side as the previous one
This method of suture is superior to that used for common wounds and requires memory
It seems like a passage from the Gospel of Matthew
If necessary, the sutures of the abdomen are corrected with two needles in order to enter it accurately into this hole and afterwards advance another needle from that one for the second suture of those which enclose them equally
You know that when the rupture occurs in the belly area, healing is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.
The practice of treating a plague is also judged by its consequences.
When you have cured the plague that occurred recently at one time by applying another remedy and reducing the swelling of it gently, doctors pause over this inflammatory blister.
When the patient's buttocks have already been opened and a cushion placed beneath them, pain is expected to occur at this point as hard pressure is applied, causing the skin to burst, and healing ointments are used; and with care that cushion must be attended by someone skilled in treating wounds for proper healing.
If you are not present for the medications at this point, pain should be observed as it begins to worsen rapidly and becomes increasingly painful over time unless wounds have been properly treated with first aid dressings only.
If the buttocks are injured and in contact with other parts of the body, pain is expected to radiate from that location towards the legs or arms, and pause at the area between them as it may be inflamed or swollen.
If pain or putrefaction occurs in the bowels themselves, it is advisable to apply a sharp remedy quickly, and especially if the perforation has occurred and there is an exit through the cavity into the body.
You know that when it comes to healing, remedies are more effective in treating the delicate parts of the body rather than those with a large intestine as they contain less poison.
It is difficult to heal when the intestine referred to as "gurgit" cannot receive treatment for its pain without causing damage throughout it and because of its size and being in that area near the nerve endings; so there are many veins nearby, due to its great number, and because of its magnitude within those areas, as well as its subtlety and proximity to nerve endings.
When one applies a poultice to the skin, and it soon becomes warm, then apply another poultice over that first one so they both stay hot.
When you have passed over the space and it has turned black or dark red, then make sure to stretch that tightly across the location where there is a blockage of blood flow in order to prevent any more blockages forming on the skin as well.
Then apply another poultice over that first one and place both of the servant's hands on either side from where it was applied to prevent any more blockages forming in the cloth or artery, and ensure they do not touch each other as well
Remember when you apply a poultice to the intestine.
If disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then perhaps it could have been restored by those who had experienced that before in their own stomachs after a blow or a fistula was made into that part of the stomach on the right side of the abdomen, which was old and had already healed, but with pain and discomfort.
When you have finished applying the poultice as it was not thought to be effective in healing that part of his body, then stretch tightly over where the pain has been settled so it may remain consolidated.
When the location has been stabilized, place a cushion on top of the patient's abdomen to prevent any further damage from this bad incident in their belly; do not interfere with that as it could lead to complications or bleeding, and stay away when you can no longer help because there are too many obstacles for them.
When you notice a small tear in the intestine and it is just that, doctors advise to use this method: adjust the two lips of the incision and place one finger over the two lips of the incision; when taking hold of those and squeeze your mouth shut, make sure not to open your jaw.
Then pause for another moment and proceed with another incision if necessary, depending on the size of the entire incision.
Then remove that and cover the opening with another incision to prevent the intestine from coming out, but do not interfere when it is already healthy.
Then make it possible for the intestine to be of a fixed length, which is recommended as being more flexible; and you will need to take hold of its two ends separately, making sure they are clean and neat, then insert them into each other with their points overlapping slightly but not too much, cutting away any excess.
This text describes a surgical procedure involving the patient's thighs, legs, chest, and hands to treat a condition that could be gout or another inflammatory disorder of joints caused by cold humors.
If the abscess is large and extensive, especially if it's in a small intestine or one of its branches, then pain may not be relieved completely from all parts of the body.
Surgery for abscesses
A fistula occurs when a cavity or abscess heals and the opening does not close properly, universally it is called a fistula and we call that an ulcer.
A fistula is truly an ulcer that occurs when the cavity or abscess heals with hard, dry, white membranes that do not cause pain and are found in areas where there is also swelling of edema, like the feet.
The membranes inside are moist, allowing for the fluid to be drained away in some hours. Some of these membranes become dry, thin, and rough.
When all causes have been stated and their symptoms explained to a doctor in division
And you should do this, if necessary, so that the doctor can perform surgery on it
Some fistulas occur in all parts of the body; such as those that infiltrate into great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the brain, or bladder, or any part of the flanks, or to the back of the spine, or to any joint composed of several parts; and from these come close proximity with the main limb.
The latter type of fistulas that is associated with difficult or impossible surgery, and which cannot be cured, but only tolerated while working in ignorance and labor.
If any fistulas are of such depth that they penetrate into the areas mentioned above and cause pain or discomfort in healing attempts, you should seek medical attention for it.
If the fistulas are tortuous, doctors should investigate to find a subtle probe as its use allows the slight bending of the body's structure and relieves the tortuosity.
If the fistulas are extremely painful, it is not advisable to seek attention for them in order to avoid complications.
When the intestines are being operated on through an incision made in another part of the body, moisture from that incision must be removed to prevent any infection from spreading there.
Very carefully consider whether the nerve damage occurred or not, and if so, whether it is a long fistula defect or short, or rather an abscess caused by the intestine. You must compress this area with your thumb over that location to prevent further infection from spreading, as well as examining causes of abscesses in connection to the appendix.
Once you have examined all of the causes at that location and the pain is evident nearby, close to the joint, long of connection or nerve, artery or vein, or any of the locations where you mentioned earlier.
Once you have determined that it is a fistula due to the breaking of its lining or due to contamination in this area, and that it occurred in an intestine's muscle layer, treat for healing that wound specifically.
If the fistula is of deep origin and you suspect this to be the case, insert a bandage impregnated with antibiotics into its cavity as well, so that all contaminated tissues are treated in order for it to heal properly.
When acute medicine runs into this, it means that there is a fistula of corruption in the cavity of the rectum.
After restoring it so that healthy flesh grows inside where it was diseased.
If not healed by this, the doctor will burn it after we recommend.
If the cause of the fistula is due to a vein or nerve or main member injury, then ask for this and seal it after we recommend if you do not forbid any reason from veins or nerves or main members as well.
If the cause is due to an ulcer or infection in it, then burn that off and treat this one with this as well, so the latter may become healthy.
If it is not healthy and gets worse as well like that one, then ask if you have already burned off the corruption entirely; also carefully examine both of them and find out their causes and healing methods to strengthen your body further, and after treating that one restore it too.
If it is healthy then go on and if not, ask that the corruption has gone deep into the body and hasn't been cured yet, and after examining there make sure to do something else.
When the stomach is small or it is possible to remove it, then take out with delicate forceps as are suitable for this
If there is a blockage in the passage, gently remove it with your strength.
If there is no cause of concern regarding humidity or infection, and the incision has neither fear nor mistake, then close up those wounds with your fingers if necessary.
If you are not prepared to remove the stitches from your operation, then let them remain as is, and leave it in place where they were applied on or near the wounds that you made during the surgery, and keep a pad to prevent any consolidation of the sutures.
If you fear that the stitches may have been submerged in oil or grease, or from some foreign substance that has entered into them, then when those wounds are healed and the sutures should be removed, and of those threads it is advisable to remove them carefully.
If the intestine or hernia is large and protrudes to that extent, only then do you take out as much of it as possible without causing any injury, and afterward cover up with a bandage
When it is necessary to make the incision of the part which has become corrupted and has reached its end into that location where corruption is occurring, then healing that incision as soon as it becomes solid is a necessity
Recommend to the patient in their thigh to prevent that from happening again, and have an assistant stand next to you while performing the surgery
Focus on the younger person's condition in the xxx area, where pain occurs in that area of their chest, and it is related to an external matter.
After focusing on the younger person's condition in that area for a long time, and having corrected their matters, and had their healing taken care of by placing a cushion over them to prevent hernia, it is necessary to heal the wounds or injuries suffered from external matters in order to recover properly and restore humidity balance.
After focusing on the condition of both sides for a long time, but not on what was wrong with them specifically and in that way, it is necessary to call upon a doctor
By the time we had finished with both sides of that person's chest, and their wounds and materials were all healed up to a large extent, and at this point they were no longer sick and their skin was back to its natural color.
When you have inserted into her vagina a certain object which she will receive from us, gently introduce it to the anus as well.
You should first examine the objects and choose one that fits all the openings of her vagina.
You should insert it into the anus as well and make sure to clean up any debris that may be left after penetration in her vagina, so that there will be no infection or spread of disease from one orifice to another.
You should make sure it is clean and prepared for insertion by examining its condition closely.
If the object was not in the anus but there is some other impurity that you have noticed and cleaned up already, you should check if it has been removed properly.
After applying conservative treatments for a long time, but still not consolidated.
You should also examine the anus again to check if there is any other impurity present after having already checked for one.
You should ensure that you have completely treated and restored the infection after having examined it closely to check if there is any remaining impurity present in both the anus and vagina.
You should examine it closely and perform the treatment bit by bit very carefully to ensure that there is no remaining impurity present in both the anus and vagina. It may also involve removing any foreign object inserted into the rectum or anus, restoring the rectal lining with medical procedures if necessary and ensuring proper healing afterwards.
"When performing the operation and cutting of it, only by ensuring that the veins are open and the patient's tolerance is low and fear of death, to avoid causing the patient any harm in all hours due to excessive discharge caused by a lack of fluid.
"In order for healing to occur, and nothing is in the place of stiff, it is good to ensure that the arrangement is right within its own body and restore its health; and he spoke to his dispositions not to put on any contrary thing during transportation or avoid any cause.
"If the eye is located in the chest, then you should perform that procedure with the following method: first remove any previous stitches from the first incision; second, extend and stretch it at the top of the arm; third, place a cushion on it to prevent it from falling out; fourth, cut off the excess skin around the area where you want to make the scar. Make sure to clear away the excess flesh around the area where you want the scar so that there is no bleeding.
"Place a cushion on top of it to prevent any movement or falling out; because when you do this there is not forbidden the cut that does not heal the damaged skin.
"Cut the scar gradually in the concave part of the corrupted area and not to appear on its surface during inspection; force to make another incision.
When the abscess is corrupt and not prominent, it continues in another place, and corruption enters into or through part of the body; therefore, doctors discover all parts with a pointed cautery to find where corruption has entered so that continuous treatment can be started at the other site.
And when there is a lesion on the place of corruption as mentioned earlier.
If the corruption is in the joint, then identify that joint corrupted and search for a location continuing from another part.
If the corruption continues in two joints instead of one, doctors will not be able to find it through any means other than investigation.
If the corruption is in the hand or foot it may be difficult; however if you want to look for where exactly the corruption has happened and that location could possibly be reached by any means available, then approach that way, and when possible correct it at that place regardless of whether it comes from a vein or nerve.
You should consider the location of the incisions and scars to identify which bones are to be cut open, prepare for that, and also consider their size, subtlety, hardness, and rarity; in order to choose an instrument suitable for this operation.
When that operation means the use of a special instrument which is necessary for its practice; when you are great at both science and medicine, and witness the diseases of both good and bad people, then it will be advisable to apply this treatment on all patients
You should write down the number of instruments you will use in simple and clear writing, so that you can refer to them later on if needed. How?
What do you want to know, specifically?
I am not sure what you are referring to. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?
How can I help you today? The key to open this lock is the sequence of points as specified in its instructions.

The smaller keyhole should be closed when pain occurs due to joint damage, or if the big hole becomes too large.
I am unable to provide a translation for that phrase as it appears to be incorrect syntax in English and is not understandable based on the context provided.
The first sentence translates to "Take a step forward. Take your hand (and possibly something else) and approach the patient gently.
When a concave space is present,
Another type of approach to use when there is no concave space available.
When approaching the patient through an extremely curved limb (such as a leg or arm)
To approach the patient in small steps like this.
Another smaller type of probe to use.
This other smaller inserter tool is similar in shape and size to the one you mentioned. It fits into place similarly and can be inserted at various locations within the bones.
To use when aiming for an opening between the bones that has already been made.
The limb is triangular in shape and extremely curved.
Do all the things that were mentioned for probes, insertions, and incisions to be made with it as well.
The incision of limbs and the cutting open of bones
Extremities can be caused by intrinsic causes or extrinsic ones; if the corruption goes untreated and spreads to other parts of the body, it may lead to death or injury that is greater than any damage to the limb itself.
When an accident happens to a member of the body, it is customary that part becomes black when touched by fire or cold and then heals itself completely if left untreated, so long as the heat remains on that part
Similarly, if it is caused by a venomous or poisonous substance like scorpion venom, adder poison, viper venom, or wolf venom, etc.
If the corruption or injury is in the finger, you must cut it off and do not place any space where the corruption has infiltrated into your hand.
Similarly if you enter the fire or hand, then cut off that part of your finger and do not place any space where corruption has infiltrated into your forearm.
If you find it, then you must cut off the arm between the joints in the joint.
If another corruption and poison enters in the cavity then it is the death of the patient, and to administer another substance for treatment you should do that which brings good fortune.
Similarly if corruption enters the foot then cut it off and place it into one of your hands.
If you take from under the foot then cut off the whole foot. When pain arises in the foot, it's customary to call it gout by doctors.
If the corruption is spreading over his foot, then they must cut off their gangrene and bring them to death.
The aim of the incision is to cut through the limb, and if necessary, sever it there where you want to make an incision, stretch another ligament over that place; and extend a minister's hand with another in its place; then remove the skin between two ligaments as far as it can be seen completely uncovered.
And when you have stopped the bleeding by pressing down on a cloth over that place to prevent further damage and call for an urgent dressing of the wound.
If there is bleeding when you cut the skin, then quickly cauterize the wound with something like sand or powder to stop it from spreading further and go back to your doctor for treatment as soon as possible.
And when you've made a cut in the limb at its most convenient place, treat it immediately with anything available to restore health.
I recommend that you take it to the home of its owner who will have dealt with accidents similar to this one and call for help from them, which is important because the fire caused by this accident was assembled in such a way that it could be used again on his foot as an incendiary device.
"The pain originates in a part of the body that extends down to the feet.
"When the pain is severe and affects both feet simultaneously, causing redness and swelling of the joint, it may be that gout has spread to one or more joints.
"The pain lasts for a long time in this particular case.
"And since it has spread throughout the body and caused damage to the extremities, it is advisable to consult a physician immediately.
"The physician should examine the patient's hands and feet carefully to see if it is necessary to act quickly in order to prevent further complications from the disease.
"The physician should examine all of them and note that gout has spread to various parts of the body.
"It was not written to instruct how the disease is spread or what its significance means but rather for medical practitioners to know about it so that they can treat patients accordingly.
"To cure and improve your health with medicines.
"When the gouty attack strikes one or both legs and lasts for several days, it becomes swollen; if you prick at its swelling, it will break and drain off the pain. If you apply a poultice made of subtle cloth soaked in vinegar to it, then the pain will go away.
Fistula
The cure for it is to apply a compress that fits tightly around it when it swells up, and especially if it becomes swollen and you squeeze it gently without adhering to the location of its infection
If you suspect that the blockage has become too tight and cannot be released through drainage, then apply a hot compress to it.
Consider applying the Egyptian medicine ointment that has oil and vinegar as its ingredients, which can be applied by rubbing it onto a gauze pad, allowing it to heat up until it is burned off on the affected area.
Then apply the Egyptian medicine to it, massaging it onto your skin and rubbing it into its fur, until it has become absorbed by the body over a span of two hours.
Then apply more frequently as days go on, until it becomes evident that the fur has been cleansed and odors have been eliminated.
Sometimes you can apply the medicine by rubbing it onto a cloth when not present on your skin. Then apply this cloth to the fur and massage it into it until you feel that the fur has been cleansed.
When the patient is not tolerant of Egyptian medicine or water from the cradle, the physician shall cleanse him with water and vinegar mixed, then he shall cleanse his body thoroughly with them, because property of vinegar causes to adhere more firmly, and it makes the excess of dryness and stiffness go away.
When you have done the above cleansing and find that the skin is reddened, the physician shall cleanse him with water to remove any redness from his body.
It is necessary to use a defoaming solution and dissolve any rancid oil in it, or else cleanse the ointments that have been tested for their properties with other remedies known from this treatise on remedies.
If the abscess of your skin is swollen and has not been treated with a needle, then increase it gradually, applying Egyptian or basilicon compresses until it is fully enlarged.
Similarly if the abscess is large, you will add more layers of it to the compresses and make sure that between each compress there are enough spaces for the pus to accumulate.
If the abscess of your arm is elevated and causing pain when you touch it, then squeeze it until pus comes out, because when the arm becomes infected with pus, the skin may be damaged.
When the patient is ready to receive it inside their mouth, you should gently put your finger on his tongue, and then press down with some force so that the member goes down into the throat.
You should make sure it's placed at his throat where he can swallow in a timely manner to prevent any choking issues that may arise from the bandage slipping out of place. To determine whether it is solid or soft, digestible or not-digestible you should ask him which one he prefers and then apply the bandage accordingly.
When considering that location on his body, if he feels pain or not-pain there, and if it is being applied to him at the moment.
When your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and if you have already adhered the bandage to his throat as instructed, or it has been applied correctly, the doctor should continue administering medication every few hours until he is finished treating him.
When the body's joints become inflamed due to cold humors infiltrating them, doctors typically call it gout.
If the bowels become inflamed due to indigestion (or perhaps a prolonged adhesion), doctors may advise rehydration with medical solutions such as dry powders or other medications, in order to decrease fluid retention and adjust excessive body fluid balance.
The doctor will examine the affected area and recommend care measures to prevent further complications such as dermatitis or other skin conditions related to excess fluids in the body fat.
The doctor may then treat the affected area with creams or powders that are applied to soothe the skin and prevent further thickening of the body fat.
The doctor may also use simple remedies such as those found in celestial lilies or farinata (chickpea flour), and recommend using the suggested creams or adjusting their application to assist with weight loss, while ensuring not to overuse them and instead continue taking other prescribed medications if needed.
When a hernia is prolonged and not treated properly, it is believed that the corruption is in the preon of the patient, and they seek treatment for fistula surgery.
In order to treat the hernia or hydrocele (swelling due to water retention), it is customary:

Do not add any more lines to the translation as it has been completed already.
If the body part is already healthy and the hernia is cured, then you should put a bandage over that area to prevent any injuries due to sharp objects or rough handling.
If the corruption is already in the body part, then you should cover it up and apply a soothing ointment to prevent any more infections occurring in that area.
"When the heart attack and stroke occur together in one person, doctors advise that they should take measures immediately.

"When joint attack occurs in the bones of the joints, treatment is difficult; therefore, it is necessary to keep a close eye on it.
When a patient's navel is to be incised for the sake of surgery in that region, let there be a proper assistant present.
When the incision between the navel folds is necessary for surgical reasons or by accident during childbirth, or due to burns, fire, or other complications, it must be done in such a way that the incision returns to its original form as quickly as possible.
If the incision between their drapes becomes infected with pus that cannot be treated, or if it is separated from them, or a thin layer of gauze must be placed over them to prevent further consolidation until it has been consolidated as soon as possible.
Similarly, if the incision is made on the palm of the hand, then it must be closed after it has been prepared and fits into the shape of the member.
The incision for veins are varicose veins.
Veins are varicose veins and those that have swollen full of melanocilli (a pigment) which can be found in the limbs of the body, particularly on the legs, and especially in the veins of the feet.
After administering purgation for black bile with strong purging, you should give the patient a dose of blood to strengthen their vein.
The first servant will go in and inspect the incision; one is to wipe away any black matter that may be there (i.e., blood or other stains), while the second is to elevate the vein and extract it completely.
The second task is to bandage the wound with water-soaked cotton, making sure that it does not get too saturated or heavy (i.e., avoid applying excessive pressure), and then press firmly on a specific point until blood flows out from the vein; if no blood comes out after three tries, loosen the bandage but continue to elevate the affected limb above heart level as much as possible.
Afterwards, instruct them to avoid any black veins causing inflammation.
Repeat the process for phlebotomy when the veins are full and unable to do otherwise
The second task is to elevate the patient's leg and bandage it with water-soaked cotton if necessary, to prevent further bleeding or excessive swelling of the veins; otherwise, exercise forcefully to stimulate blood flow (if not available, apply pressure on a specific point until visible blood flows from the vein).
When pain occurs in a vein near the arm or hand, it is customary for doctors to apply warmth there.
When pain occurs in all the veins of that limb, it is customary to apply warmth there because sometimes this helps alleviate the discomfort.
In addition, when you pass through the passage where the vein is concerned, do so gently as possible.
Place that hand above and below the vein such that it supports its elevation and depression from the groin area.
When pain occurs in a vein near the elbow or knee joint, it is customary for doctors to apply warmth there as well.
Place that hand above and below the elbow or knee joint, such that it supports its elevation and depression from the second joint area, and place another one on top of the latter to support as well.
Put that hand above the highest joint and below all other joints, to support its elevation and depression from every area; then apply warmth to those.
If you find it difficult to apply warmth from above and below simultaneously, place the needle securely in two places and rotate your hand over that area until all of them are down. When the wound was not closed, if it was torn open, then do so gently raise that part and place it over the patient's chest to prevent any further loss of blood.
When the bandage was completely removed and soaked in wine or oil that had been rubbed with vinegar or not rubbed with vinegar, then cure it so that it is safe to use again.
If the throat is affected by pain that is so severe as to cause it to be swollen in the neck or face, and you have already said this, then do cover it completely with a bandage on its entire area of tortuosities and locations from where it comes out, and support it upright until it recovers.
When you are taking care of your section that has not been sealed and does not cause any harm to it or others nearby, then do so gently raise it, and serve your prudence in this situation.
What type of incident occurred?
It is of a type that causes great flexibility to the limb and if it were subtle, it would cause the vein to rupture due to its subtlety; however, in this situation where there is excessive grossness like what we've mentioned, there may be nothing more serious.
From the veins of the calves.
This vein is generated in the legs below as well, at the time of giving birth and also on Indian soil, which is dry with little life force and lacks green vegetation
And even further down it can be found in other parts of the body such as the legs.
The process of it is one of decay, where the venom enters the body through veins and arteries and creates sores and worms as they spread between the skin and flesh.
The indication of the presence of it is characterized by intense inflammation in the affected limb, which quickly becomes swollen and a vein appears to burst from that site as if with great force.
When you notice the appearance of it in an extremity, have you wrap your hand around that part and feel for its weight, which should be that of a dragon's claw.
Whenever you find any cause to suspect it may be elsewhere, cover this with your palm and check there too. If it becomes prolonged, you suspect another part and wrap your arm around that too; but if you do not find any indication there either, then that is considered a sign of the presence in the flesh and causes great harm to the body with pain and ulcers.
When joints are subjected to great amounts of cold humors gradually infiltrated into the body part by part until it reaches the feet and stays in them without any cause within the chest.
And at that moment it arrives in the veins of those who are on their right side, reaching to the length of two fingers and is also present when venomed with one of these.
If it is diagnosed during the patient's treatment, it infiltrates into their veins and perforates that area of the chest, until it is evacuated from that point in the matter, and administers putrefaction for a certain number of days with medicines; and appropriately treats it by the cure of ulcers.
That vein sometimes swells and especially when it appears on the joint of the foot or leg, and goes to that swelling with orifices, and is present in each one of them.
So it is cured by dividing it as described above into that which it is due to.
A section of the abdomen under the skin and called bovine itchiness
This illness is commonly known as bovine itchiness where the hairs stand up on all parts of the body and then fall down, appearing only on one member at a time until it breaks through the skin and goes away.

It is feared for the sake of malice that when he enters his body and is elevated to the head, it passes through the hole, causing great harm to him, so as to end up killing him.
And when you want to cure him and extract him out, the doctors cannot do so without first making his body feel it strongly and clearly, as well as holding tightly that which is over him and that from which he suffers greatly, then tighten on him and extract him
If it is necessary in the flesh and you do not harm him, then put a cautery fire over the place where he lies, and the main cause that we fear is corruption of his part and how this corrupts the location as well.
And if he enters his head first through the hole in him, then tighten on top of it with great stricture, and fix your hand over him, extract that, then; and concerning what the patient uses from medicinal evacuation of their body's bad humors to keep themselves healthy and prevent putrefaction.

Some vegetables are very painful during phlebotomy, however not as much when compared to other phlebotomies of the same area, except for the extremities; phlebotomize it second through the vein transversely so that its exit is close and easy to cut off in case of a fine one.
When the veins of both eyes are inflamed and swollen in their sockets, and also in the cheeks due to weeping, it is called pinguecula by doctors
The quality of phlebotomy is that the patient's body strength is increased a bit and then the phlebotomist sits on top of their head.
The second sentence of phlebotomy is to make the incision at right angles for a short distance and then stop it when the flesh is reached; and if the phlebotomist is delicate, be very careful not to cut off their extremity.
Then proceed with great caution as needed, pausing over the area and then tighten it up again, repeating this process several times.
The phlebotomist makes incisions in the veins of the nose that cause fever and sweating, along with those on the face, and more so when they occur in the face, especially during a cold or flu.
The quality of phlebotomy in this case is that the patient's body strength increases and then the phlebotomist applies pressure to their nose with their left hand while holding the vein gently between their thumb and forefinger towards the front of their head, so that it doesn't show above the neck.
After that, proceed with great caution as needed and gradually make the incisions wider while holding them down, until they are restored to their proper size again.
"This is the first stage of the plague or leprosy, characterized by stiffness and pain at its onset.
"The quality of plague or leprosy is that the patient feels pain in their limbs when they move them, and there may be numbness around the head as well.
"First, apply the plague or leproso to the affected limb slowly and gradually, and if it is necessary to do so, then place a bandage around that limb as well.
"Firstly, stretch out the affected veins gently to prevent further complications in the limb as it heals.
"The first stage of plague or leprosy involves lesions on the veins as well as blisters and sores in the mouth, gums, nose, and throat.
"The quality of plague or leprosy is that the patient loses sensation in their limbs as they move them, and stretching out the arm to examine each vein closely can demonstrate whether one or both are affected veins on the right side of the lips.
When there is doubt as to which it should be done, you are unsure whether it is one of those or another, then explain in detail the manner by which they should proceed with the greater or more obvious of them
The same way as for the veins that are on the arms
The veins in the labia that they should puncture are located at the tip of their tongue and above their epiglottis, as well as below their uvula and within their mouth.
The quality of puncturing those veins is to move the patient between their sheets and lift their tongue up, ensuring it does not come out through either vein, and observe which one is draining blood more clearly.
After puncturing each of them: ensure that you do not end your application there, as those veins are arteries.
The veins that they have punctured are located in the parts where all men's veins usually pierce through and their phlebotomies occur at two different sites or in a single spot on each thigh, depending on preference. Either way, the phlebotomy must be performed delicately so as to avoid any injury to them, unless it is planned for superficial phlebotomy, in which case there should be an additional check nearby
To gently open veins that are thick and large, as well as those that contain clots or are narrowed
The olive phlebotomy method is gentler and less risky than others, suitable for veins that are thin but contain tiny clots.
The phlebotomy of the vein called "basilic vein" which is one of three veins to be used for drainage of bile from the gallbladder and the abdomen.
The phlebotomist must hold tight when performing the phlebotomy to ensure it is strong and steady as he or she may damage the artery if not careful during puncturing and inserting the needle.
If the basilic vein is not palpable through superficial palpation, it means that you should move on to another vein or seek another approach, or puncture the opposite arm if necessary. And remember to perform olive phlebotomy in this manner as we mentioned earlier.
When you want to do a phlebotomy on the patient, first place your hand inside the location where you want to take blood from their arm, and afterwards fix it firmly so that no other part of your body touches the vein, or else you will not be able to perform a proper phlebotomy.
When you compress the limb while applying tourniquet, inflation of that location will occur in the artery and therefore it should be compressed immediately to prevent blood loss.
If the bleeding during phlebotomy occurs as a result of an artery injury and is severe enough to be life-threatening, you should compress it immediately with tourniquet, or else it may cause further blood loss.
The patient's condition is monitored closely and their pain medication is given to prevent any further complications from occurring during the time that they are being treated.
If the bleeding does not stop and you need to administer pain medication at this time, apply pressure over the artery if it is visible or feel for a pulse in your hand; compress the extremity where the injury occurred, hold down on both ends of tourniquet until further assistance arrives.
When joints are inflamed due to the passage of hot humors, then you shall cure that person with this remedy which was previously mentioned in the passage about the powders that should be taken out of one's bowels.
The removal of a hernia is difficult due to limited space in the small area around it and also because of the limitations on use of one's arm.
The fistula vein surgery is done from the top of the head down to the bottom of the chest, and it consists of arteries from both the basilical region and the cerebral region as well.
The phlebotomist should take into account that there may be some soreness during the fistula vein surgery, as this could happen if a nerve is touched or injured; in such cases, it would cause stupor and can be difficult to recover from, and even without treatment, it might not heal completely. If you feel any numbness or tingling in your hands, avoid touching that area at all costs.
If the vein is between two nerves, you should cut it along its length.
The recent development of the fistula vein surgery is that they treat the condition from top to bottom, including treating any related conditions on the head as well.
In this particular case, if you want to stop the flow of blood from veins or arteries, do not damage the artery or nerve.
However, very importantly when you're performing the first cut on a vein without performing a phlebotomy (taking blood), make sure to ensure that you are not cutting over an artery.
The first cut should be made in one of the veins that is located on the head or neck region: cephalica, fusca and basilica; and the phlebotomy should begin from the beginning of this vein to another nearby vein, with care taken during application as significant bleeding may occur.
The third day or later in a 24-hour period should be the time for phlebotomy to take place.
When administering leeches to a patient who is experiencing discomfort or need it, at any time and in all times
And if it is not administered to the patient within three months and up to seven, then these are the measures that have been taken without leeches.
And when it is necessary to administer leeches according to your opinion, make sure that the vessels of the intestines do not enter into their cavity during the application of leeches on the thigh, as if there are cracks in them, so that the veins will not cause any harm to the pure arteries and not affect the main members.
Do not administer leeches to patients who are suffering from a fever or delirium, nor from malady or fright until it is certain that this remedy does no harm, nor from jaundice or dropsy, and may the application of leeches be tempered with moderation so as not to cause vomiting or stomachache, nor excessive multiplication of worms, nor exercise of any kind or vigils, but all causes which dissolve the body or animal.
Consider with subtlety the qualities of those who are affected by this condition as to their tastes for food and drink, medicine if it is necessary according to your ability at that moment.
Between a finger's breadth there should be no prohibition or exercise to prevent its subtlety
The phlebotomy of the chest is done in three hours as well
It is necessary to keep the chest protected from all kinds of animal accidents as well as angina, heart attack, fear, and bodily injuries, along with excessive sweat and coldness
It is necessary to find the causes that correspond to the uses of which herbs are known for their scent and taste, as well as those who can be used in large quantities.
The phlebotomist should be careful when removing the one from which they have already taken blood
Then stretch the arm with both hands and pull gently on it for three seconds; after that, straighten out your wrist and extend your elbow.
Tighten your fist and hold it for a moment while keeping the other one loose or stretched, if you want to increase blood flow; or you can use this as a massage, where you gently press on your chest.
Tighten the fist and hold it for a moment while keeping the other one loose or stretched to increase blood flow; or you can use this as a massage, where you gently press on your chest.
"The attendant first cleanses the patient's hand and forearm with a damp cloth to prevent injury.
And then proceed as follows: The attendant ensures that the phlebotomist is firmly seated and encourages him in all these actions.
Then pause the phlebotomy procedure and apply pressure if bleeding occurs, either over the elbow or onto a cloth to cover the area in case of injury.
If the patient is bleeding or has fainted, wait one or two days and do not strain yourself too much in order to prevent further injury or loss of consciousness.
Then proceed with the phlebotomy procedure as usual if she/he comes around.
If the needle is small and risks causing too much bleeding or if you fear it may not extract enough blood, then proceed with the phlebotomy procedure in that way as before, adjusting to fit into a few seconds, but keep the pressure on so that the area does not become numb from lack of sensation.
"When one has opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, they should then gently apply pressure on that area to prevent any bleeding from occurring. The first sentence translates as: "It is best in this location to use it (the cushion) and the others too.
Similarly, when administering bloodletting at the site of a fistula (a hole created to drain pus), it is customary to apply this procedure gently and carefully, as the wound may be sensitive and may bleed easily if too much pressure is applied suddenly.
If there is a large amount of bleeding at the site of the phlebotomy (a procedure in which blood is drained), it's best to apply pressure with gauze soaked in water and salt for only a short time, as applying too much pressure can cause bruising or swelling that lasts longer than an hour.
It's best to use the same bandage on both sides of the vein at a time, and not just one side
If you notice any redness or green discoloration at the site of application, do not apply it further and instead stop to assess the situation; if desired, place a bandage on that area as well to prevent further bleeding, put aside any causes for concern such as those causing ulcers or ulcers, and similar ones.
The first sentence translates to: "The veins of the head become paralyzed from excessive bleeding into the basilica.
Then, place your hand over it and if the pain increases with compression do not compress it anymore as this would be worsening the situation.
Then apply a plaster to that area in order to harden it and seek another remedy to heal it.
And take from the sick one according to their quantity of health and the color they have lost in comparison with the normal appearance.
If the sick one is black, you should use a dark color to heal them as this would be beneficial; and similarly if they are large, you should use a light color to heal them so that subtlety of healing could be maintained; and similarly if they are sharp then it's best to use a soft color for them.
And apply that which is thick and strong in a vein, increasing the bleeding of the vein itself as well.
For one that is thin do the opposite and apply it in many places so that the flow of blood would not be obstructed
The most beneficial thing to administer by a vein thrombosis is to perform transverse incision instead of puncturing it
The first sentence translates to "This treatment for phlebotomy saves from the flow of blood and injury to nerves.
The second sentence translates to "And when you cure that disease, you will observe that phlebotomy is applied in three or four doses.
The third sentence translates to "And if it is necessary to infuse phlebotomy with bitter or sweet aromatic substances such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and others, or with an aromatic and fragrant infusion.
The fourth sentence translates to "And when you observe that disease, drink water with a subtle infusion of bitter or fragrant substances, and apply the aromaticity on it.
The fifth sentence translates to "Use any other causes that are mentioned in the division of phlebotomy for evacuation purposes.
The sixth sentence translates to "If you want to have the hand dissolve and evacuate the sick part of two days later, this is because phlebotomy causes evacuation by removing it bit by bit as time goes on, until the quantity reaches a certain amount of persistent days.
"The first doctor will start the operation with a sharp incision on their left arm and then proceed to make an incision on their right side.
"The surgeon will start the operation by making an incision on one side of the chest opposite to where it started from and then proceed with another incision on the third day if needed.
"The chest incision should be made on the side where the previous one was already made and was sharp but not too long to prevent complications like infection or bleeding, unless you have saved all the conditions for a thoracotomy; place your hand over his head so that no air is inhaled into the wound during surgery. If the surgeon is unaware of or negligent about this precaution, the patient may suffer more harm than good.
"When you want to disconnect the second arm and remove the incision from that side, ensure that both veins are closed properly and take great care during surgery in order to avoid complications like bleeding or causing damage to other organs.
"After the second thoracotomy incision is made, ensure that the blood clot in the vein at the bottom of the incision is removed; or cover it with a pad to prevent damage from swelling if needed.
When a vein is opened up, stop touching it immediately so that it does not close.
If you need to evacuate the second vein and there is no other option, place it over another arm or another vein in that case.
If the called vein is located on the arm or in a similar location when it cannot be found or reached, then consider that it consists of these veins.
The quality of the puncture is that the patient puts their hand in water with a pointed instrument inside, causing redness and visible veins to appear prominently.
Place it so that the point is on or near a straight line (not diagonally) and do not use a small cut for this puncture
Do it wide and your puncture near where you make the small punch.
If it is prohibited for blood to flow through the vein, place your hand in water and let it run into the water so that you fulfill your need.
If you are in the summer days, be excused from the puncture of your hand into water and place it on the vein in water during a cold spell (drought).
When a patient has suffered from a phlebotomy of this vein that cannot be saved because all the other veins are also damaged, and there is no pulse or nerve found in it
A phlebotomy of the right arm is considered an injury to the physician.
The quality of the phlebotomy is that you should remove it from your hand immediately if you see swelling or it has already been demonstrated at once, and do not phlebotomize that which does not exist in this case
Do not remove the bandage from your hand after the phlebotomy has taken place and may damage the nerves of the fingers being exposed to skin.
Place your hand in water immediately and let the bleeding stop there, because if you do not remove the bandage from your hand while bleeding occurs, the blood may clot in the arm's artery, and it is prohibited to flow.
When the bleeding stops to a certain extent and it is necessary, then put pressure on the vein as well, so that it does not harden immediately; also do the same in all other limbs.
A phlebotomy of the left arm is considered an injury to both physicians.
Do it similarly for the phlebotomy of this one as you have done with the other one.
"The new vein from the phlebotomia is in the veins of those who are part of the body. It is also found in the veins of the larger ones and the retentive vessels. And it is present in the old veins of the legs and veins, as well as the sores and ulcers on the thighs and legs.
"The quality of phlebotomia is that the patient's feet swell with water and become covered in a cloth as if they had been stuffed into it; furthermore, its location on the foot will be very apparent, and its branches will spread over the face of the foot.
"Therefore, phlebotomia must be treated with great urgency and care as it can cause severe damage.
"If phlebotomia appears on the face of the foot, keep your hands away from it and postpone seeking medical help until you can safely reach a doctor.
Goodbye phlebotomia
"If the phlebotomia is causing swelling, you should keep your foot elevated and try to drain it in that location.
"If the phlebotomia occurs suddenly in one of your legs, do not worry too much - you can keep seeking medical help soon enough as long as you are careful to avoid touching it.
Similarly, the pain of the other foot
And from sciatic nerve pain, it is customary to put a cushion under the wild part of their leg as well.
The youthfulness of the phlebotomy procedure is the same no matter where they occur punctually.
The quality of the phlebotomy procedure is that it can cause swelling and pain in the area around the vein, and if done improperly or inadequately, may result in a longer and more subtle injury which appears only at this point.
Therefore, when it appears, the pain from phlebotomy is similar to that of a second cut and transection, but may not be as serious if done properly or adequately, causing no lasting damage; however, incisions made improperly or inadequately may result in a separate cut which will heal more slowly.
The phlebotomy procedure is performed very carefully and the patient should not feel any pain at all; if it seems to cause some discomfort or there is no sensation of bleeding in that area, then a second attempt may be made by cutting another part of his foot near the ear and nose.
Keep your nerves and let go of the pain as much as you want to.
Place a cushion on that part of the phlebotomy site and hold it tightly while bleeding occurs, as this is necessary for safety.
With regard to the use of those items.
Those objects are for corn use, or maybe for veins, or maybe for a fire.
The objects are used in the following way: one for incision and extraction of flesh, and another for making incisions.
This object that is used for incision is also in two forms; either it's to set fire to or the fire itself.
The objects that are used for incision and extraction of flesh occur in twelve locations on the body: one at the top of the head, the other at the bottom; two on each side of the neck; three over both arms; four on each hand; five below the chin; six on either side of the chest; seven on either side of the spine; eight under each armpit; nine in front and behind of each ear lobe; ten by the nose, and eleven at each buttock.
The object does not extract flesh but only the veins in small parts of the flesh, and therefore it is done together with phlebotomia; nor that an incision be made at fire or flames under any circumstances to prevent the body from being evacuated.
When there is a need to perform surgery for the patient either in the middle of the month or at the end of it, we will administer that treatment from every corner of the place and whenever necessary
And when it comes to any of these cases, and especially if it is at the third or middle of the month, the doctors order that surgery be performed within three or two hours.
The first sentence should be translated as: "The doctors order that the treatment of surgery for that particular case is to occur as soon as possible, and it is necessary that the cause of this severity in the head must also bring about a complete evacuation from every part of the body.
The first sentence should be translated as: "The treatment for surgery performed due to cephalic phlebotomy is at the site where it occurs.
When complex bleeding occurs or when there is a great abundance of phlegm in that part, it can lead to great discomfort
You should not use those vessels if they are clogged or the veins where swelling occurs
When you continue to cover the affected part with your hand while it is still painful and when you want to prevent a recurrence of gout, ask the phlebotomist to pause for a moment by placing a small bandage over the area where pain occurs
When the phlebotomist is in the location of the femoral artery and the basilic vein, they will confirm that there are no obstructions or narrowing of the arteries or veins, which means the procedure can be safely performed
When you place a small bandage on the affected area and pause it if it is done, there will be weakness in the body or stomach
The phlebotomist will confirm the presence of any discomfort in the head, sight, voice, and pain in the teeth or gums, as well as in the location of the basilic vein.
Ask the phlebotomist to avoid making any small incisions that may cause bleeding in the artery and restrict blood flow.
The phlebotomist will check the mouth for any ulcers or gum infections that may be present and in the location of the basilic vein on both sides of the neck.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and when there is pain in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call it gout.
The veins of the two feet, when inflamed by phlebotomy of three veins, are called basilica veins, and fusca, cephalica; because those arteries that are in the flesh, and those veins small among the larger ones that come out through the opening in the three veins.
The phlebotomist is commanded not to proceed with cutting, because it will damage the flesh and arteries.
It is a treatment that involves applying it to the thighs, and also to the hemorrhoids of the anus and ulcers.
The phlebotomist is commanded to make a large incision and also to make the small ones because the location requires fine dissection; and very thick incisions are not suitable for this procedure.
The veins of the legs are exposed in detail for inspection, and cause pain from the kidneys and bladder, as well as menstruation, and discomforts to both sexes; and there is phlebotomy on two feet, and also the two calves.
"In one breath, throughout the chest, let's spread it evenly over each part of the body.
"From the top to the bottom, move both legs at once towards the back of two steps.
"The quality of the position of the legs is that you should put one leg first and bend it slightly early on, do not prolong the position of the legs, make sure to alternate them, and keep them relaxed while allowing the fluids to move naturally. "Do not stop repeating this and continue until you see the redness appear and inflation, as well as when the question comes.
"The pain will decrease little by little, and carefully consider each time you breathe in deeply.
"For someone who has a rough skin surface like sandpaper, you should apply it sparingly and not rub too vigorously to prevent the area from being irritated.
"Instruct the masseur or physiotherapist gently massage in small amounts while breathing evenly.
"If the pain is severe, apply two compresses at once, with one being very gentle in its approach and touchiness to the area. "In the second compress be cautious about avoiding any extra pressure on the affected area that is sensitive or prone to injury.
When there's a foul smell from the patient, the physicians will make an incision in order to reach the affected area and cure it
And if we want to remove only a little bit or just a small part of the foul smell, then we make an incision in that area.
And if we want to remove the foul smell completely and/or if it is necessary for the foul smell to be larger, then doctors make a more extensive incision.
The depth of the incision depends on its purpose.
If the abscess is large and filled with pus that causes difficulty in exuding, then it may be necessary to make an incision through which air can pass out easily so as to release pus more quickly; if done during summer, one may apply oil of lavender or violet or chamomile, or the same thing mentioned earlier.
If the pus is excessive and viscous, then doctors may apply oil of aloes or oil of balsamite or oil of lavender, or any other similar oil, according to their discretion.
If the abscess is located in a tender part of flesh, doctors will avoid using oil and will have those involved perform a warm or cool compress on that area to help drain it out more quickly, applying water from sunlight, river, or any other source mentioned earlier; according to their discretion
When someone has a runny nose that is due to moisture, blow their nostrils gently or with warm air, or with water from mist and salt or similar things
When someone has thick phlegm in their nose, blow it gently or with warm air, or use a saline solution that is stronger than usual, or from camphor, eucalyptus, or chamomile, and similarly
If the nose is blocked up, you should blow it gently and administer a decongestant in the form of a spray or drops every hour or two, and make sure to rest your nasal passages properly.
What is necessary to regulate blood flow in the nostrils before using nose drops?
First of all: When using decongestants or nose drops that cause irritation and inflammation in the nasal passages, it is necessary to prevent colds as well, eat honey and warm liquids such as tea, and avoid things like soda and alcohol, and similarly
Take breaks in between doses, eat foods that are cold, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol, and drink fluids that have been cooked to kill bacteria, and similarly
When the complexion is affected by dryness, it's necessary to drink water or foods that contain caffeine and alcohol in moderation, take breaks from eating spicy and hot foods, avoid cold drinks like coffee and tea, and ensure you have enough to eat and drink, and pause the consumption of beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.
When it's cold outside or when someone has a fever, drink more than water.
If someone is given medication for a fever or cold and they are shivering or their main members are being affected by the cold outside or by fever, then these main parts should be warmed up gently so that they become comfortable and this prevents the skin from becoming too sensitive; do not give them anything else.
When the fingers are cold and stiff or if they become numb from being in a cool environment, over the hand, elbow and thumb joints, these parts should be rubbed gently so that they do not suffer from stiffness; do not rub them too much as it may cause harm to their structure.
It is not advisable to do this because if the numbness occurs in the fingers and reaches up to the elbow or the thumb joint, then it may cause harm to these parts of the body; also it will dissolve coldness that enters through the nose and reach down into the member, over the belly and the elbow, causing that part of the member to be stiffened and scalped, making pain worse as it resolves the cold.
When you sneeze or cough, it is advisable to hold the nose tightly and pull back on the head so as not to let it become loose; when this happens repeatedly often enough that can cause damage to your head
Similarly placed when you are placed over the belly button and the belly will expand in these small spaces
These openings are administered with suction only, while others are treated by fire.
Some of these openings are filled with water droplets in the belly button's folds.
This is done to fill it and keep it full, whether water alone or a mixture of herbs suited for this purpose.
The size of the orifice is determined as follows: two fingers wide when formed, and the amount of urine to be measured with a pipette; and its length in relation to itself, or its circumference, by measuring it at one end against another.
The edge of the blade should be placed large enough to prevent the member from slipping off it.
It can either cross vertically or horizontally at right angles.
The larger the better, unless it is used for a small area like belly button or thighs, and only when they are not injured, should be very gentle.
The openings of the fingers and thumbs differ from those of the smaller toes and larger buttocks.
The quality of the cushion to be placed over a member is that it extends the flame from kindling gently with just a small candle, and pause it on top of the transverse ribcage in place of the cushion, so as not to burn the patient's chest
The cushion is placed over the patient's member and it is put on top of the ribcage where we have told you to place it, so that when you open up the wounds, do not say anything else but what has already been said and let vapor fall onto that ribcage, then the wound will dissolve itself.
Place your hand on top of the body after removing the cushion.
The wound is administered in the patient with water only, without a transverse ribcage or cavity, and it is not given but filled up with water, and placed over that member alone.
The method of administering the wound is this way: When it becomes larger in size, so much better, as a large amount of water will be received.
Chapter 72
The wounds are not administered to the members of the body but rather to those that cannot be given an opening for them due to their smallness or delicacy, like the teeth and tongue, and so on; or in a member of flesh, such as the nose or lips.
The quality of those you have found are in the waters or air, or if they are from other sources.
It is necessary to make the incision at the bottom of the abdomen and from there it makes its way down through the small intestines, then the large intestines, finally reaching the member affected by gout - placing a cushion under them helps prevent any leakage into the belly or womb.
And now what?
If it is possible to remove from that spot the inflammation, I suggest doing so quickly and with caution in youth.
And if not, then wash the area gently and prepare for it to be treated.
If the pain in the groin is caused by blood clots and this occurs often enough to be significant, then wash it gently with water and place a cloth over it to prevent further harm
If the ailment is multiplied and the cause seems to be from a sour or gallic acid, then wash with vinegar, salt water, or other simple remedies until the ailment ceases; if it persists, place cushions over the affected area to prevent further spread of ailments and symptoms.
And now, if necessary, change the blood that is causing pain when you can find a better one.
When the blood vessels are prohibited from suspension and pain occurs in the location immediately or a needle is inserted into the locations where it happens, and if they are blocked, then those who feel any pain will be sent away
When you want to cause the foot to slip over onto that side of the line, sprinkle a little salt on it, or powder of lime, or charcoal, and apply as much as necessary.
After starting from the beginning point (origin), to restore This chapter is necessary in the study of medicine, and restoration of fractures and dislocations occurs in the bones.
Oh son, hear that the chapters on medicine are for doctors and pharmacists who use drugs in ancient times
For this reason it is necessary for the study of science in our land to be secret; and you are not allowed in these times unless otherwise stated, but only by reading the books of the ancients and studying their understanding of them, within which knowledge increases science.
I will go ahead to investigate and study in the length of my life.
You have described in this chapter everything that concerns my science and what I have experienced the most important experiments; you will make them available to others and explain how they can be useful for further study; and you will show it at the end of explanation, and present it at the end of conclusion; and form it like these forms which are used in those cases as when addition is made, so that the same way has been done in two preceding chapters.
The First Physician
Translation: We make our beginning by discussing the fractures of bones and dislocations or other such injuries in one member at a time. "Now that we've covered the basics of this chapter, let us proceed to discuss each of these topics in more detail; and let the commencement be upon the truth about them; for it is your duty, if you are able or willing, to learn and practice this noble art.
"When fractures or dislocations or sprains or contusions occur, then in order to remove the pain, you should either apply immediate treatment such as leeches or poultice, or you should go directly to that part of the body where it occurred if there is no other cause for the pain. It could be a cold spot on your body, a sudden shock, excessive heat or friction.
"And to be careful with the use of leeches and poultice: do not apply them too often or cover them up completely in order to prevent blockage of the veins, otherwise you may risk having your materials drained from a member.
"Then return the intestine back into its original position, as is customary with it.
When the bone has been broken and is being restored, the doctor will feed it with nourishing food, moisture, salt, sugar, fat, from cows' milk, flesh, feathers, and animal intestines, to make its coagulating substance.
Bones heal more slowly when they are in the first and second stages of healing, as their nature requires drying out the members affected by them
Nature adjusts and unites the broken bone with great strength in such a way that it regains its elasticity as before, unless there is something to prevent this from occurring, such as excessive fat or hardness.
For this reason, it is necessary to stop feeding the patient with foods rich in viscosity and thickness as we mentioned before.
"Joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet.
You remember the explanation of every kind of fracture mentioned separately in its own distinct chapter.
There is great variety of fractures in that manner. The different kinds of fractures in the leg are: curved fractures that happen on top of each other; and some are called broken bones because they have dislocation or disruption at their ends; and there are also compound fractures where the bone fragments pierce through the skin but not into the muscle, such as the fracture that occurs with a blow to the head and disrupts it.
Every type is unique in healing process after remembering its description in those locations.
Message of fracture of the arm The type of fracture mentioned is a spiral fracture that causes the bone to twist and protrude from the skin with swelling at its end; it may also cause dislocation when you try to touch your hand against it.
If there is not an obvious spiral twist and it does not feel like a fracture when you touch the arm against anything but your own hand without causing significant pain, then it is not a spiral fracture.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If the area has been bent without being split into two or more pieces and it is not torn in half or otherwise, then you should begin with your usual remedies to address this issue.
If the pointed cautery has been applied and it is necessary to wait for a few days before removing it, then apply equal force equally on both sides in order to lift and move.
The restoration of the area and the incision are easier when it is not swollen, so wait until this swelling subsides.
After applying the pointed cautery, you should recall your remedies for treatment.
If both legs are affected or if one leg is severely affected and the other less so, or if it's just your left hand versus your right hand, you should extend your arm in order to apply the remedies.
Your positioning should be as close to the affected member's normal shape as possible while extending your fingers of both hands in order to apply the remedies at each location you need to go.
You should prevent the patient from falling during the operation or injury, and ensure that both hands are applied at once to each other in order of the multiple cuts.
You should use your strength at that moment to hold onto the patient's hand, and if there is no other reason for doing so, correct it by ensuring both hands are applied equally.
Perform vigorous stretching and compression, just like the muscles of your arms that are used for a specific operation, or use them to perform a contracture in the affected member as it was observed during the training of those muscles.
The quality of the contraction should be such that you understand that members are different in their size, shape, and size as well as each other; this is important for understanding how to perform contractions differently according to the specific muscle being used.
When small sores appear on the body, it is customary to cover them with a very thin cloth
When larger sores appear on the body, it is customary to cover them with a thicker cloth
After it begins to spread, stop the evacuation and place bandages in a three-layered or four-layered manner over the area of that fracture so as not to damage the member further; stretch your hand slightly onto them.
After placing it on the site of that fracture, stretch your hand so as not to cover up what you have already stretched onto that area. After placing it on the site of that fracture with a thin cloth, gradually reduce its tension little by little until you have reached from there to another large area.
After placing another bandage over the affected area, make sure to cover it with a new, thinner cloth; then place the bandages from that fracture; and stretch your hand in order to do both of these things on top of what you have already done with the first band-aid.
After placing bandages from the front or back of that part where the fracture is located and securing them in place, if there are twists to it; otherwise do not pause on it for any cause.
When you have placed a cushion under their thighs and another on each leg, and still another on the chest holding onto them with your hands.
The cushion should have a certain width and height. Or maybe it's formed with foam? Or perhaps made of palm leaves? And the size of each cushion in relation to its shape and figure is as follows:
The cushion placed on the fracture should be larger than the other cushions and not smaller by much, with its length related to the size of the member in terms of length and width; and when you stretch over the other cushion after your first stretch, make sure it's as close to the correct fit as possible.
The threads should be thinner and more subtle, but not too thin; if the threads are thick, then consider removing some of them during the surgery to correct this mistake as it is a great error when the fit is not equality
If very thin threads are not suitable, then you should try to achieve the fit as closely as possible, and there shouldn't be much difference between one cushion and another
When the hernia is located between the patient's thighs and pressed into a constriction in those places, the pain stops when those of the cushion support prevent it from occurring
Sometimes fractures occur and disrupt the conversation, causing you to remember something from that very moment on in the second person singular
If a member is broken and cannot be laid on the first day, it will cause you to wait over the days or weeks until an opportunity for observation arrives.
This is the way of caring for sprains as the ancients used to care for fractures and dislocations.
The remedy for sprains as the ancients used to treat fractures is that you should not apply heat or oil: instead, use flour paste and rub it on with your fingers into the muscles of your thighs; this will aid in restoring movement and flexibility to the affected area.
And how is it used then? Not by applying it to the whole body but by placing a small amount on affected areas and using it with care, avoiding excessive or delicate application; use this method as needed.
Another remedy for sprains and fractures is to use a poultice made from saffron, lavender, acacia, aloe vera or mallow: these are all known as herbal remedies; you can apply the poultice in water or on its own but if the pain has spread, it's recommended that you place the poultice directly on the affected area.
"The first man dies as the result of a broken bone and dislocation: the remedy is to apply white ointment and dragon's teeth, X; from marrow and claw of the dragon Y; from acacia leaves Z.
"The three sentences are in a mortar and pestle; the first is to crack them, the second to mix with water or alcohol and administer.
"The remedy for joint and bone separation is to separate the parts from each other; if pain occurs in these and fractures, place it submerged under water or oil.
"In this situation, do not attempt to restore the damaged part; instead, apply a pointed cautery and expel the pain immediately.
"The remedy for a broken part that cannot be restored is to apply the figwort and rue salve, then apply the dragon's teeth.
"The remedy for a broken bone that has already been administered and you want to resolve the pain of the wound: apply the dragon's teeth, the camomile flowers, and viola petals; flour of horse chestnut, from all parts torn off; tear up the pieces and put them in vinegar. If no scalf is felt.
When cold humor infiltrates each part of the body and causes pain in one's feet
When the first ulcer is diagnosed and treated with a pointed cautery, you should also apply a balm or ointment of aloe vera to prevent further ulcers from forming and healing existing ones, as well as balms for greater pain relief, majorana, violets, camamilla, and all other part thereof; this balm will be applied externally.
When treating the ulcer, you must place a cushion on top of it to prevent any further spreading and ensure that only ointment or balm is applied to heal it without causing any harm or other complications; also, recommend making the difference between thickness and delicacy.
When treating the ulcer on a broken part of the body, you must ensure that it is covered with a cushion to prevent further spreading and that only ointment or balm should be applied to heal it without causing any harm or other complications; also, recommend making note of the causes related to heat so as not to repeat them.
When assessing the lesion and pain: take note of any existing cuts or wounds, salt, parts from home remedies, ointments to soothe, aloe vera, balm for healing.
When the amount of pain that arises from the leg is such that it prevents movement or stretching, then consider if there has been an accident and neither injury nor cut on the limb, you should not regret days lost If an accident occurs with strong pain or discomfort that causes swelling, you should treat it as soon as possible and apply the appropriate treatment measures.
Dip the leg and apply a damp cloth to cool it down, submerge that in lukewarm water for 15 minutes, and then gently massage the limb until the discomfort or pain is subsided; and place a poultice over it to prevent swelling of the limb, and ensure the pain subsides.
Apply a small, thin strip to gently wrap around your finger first, and then gently apply that over the affected area so as to be helpful in healing.
If all the pain and swelling incidents are gone, and you apply a strip gently in the same manner as before, then proceed with treatment measures accordingly.
If there is no accident on the member that has been mentioned, then do not apply anything but proceed three days or four days later or seven days from now; and some bandages should be applied for 10 days after you appear before the doctor to have an examination of the limb as well, so that any fractures adhere, and it approaches coagulation of the flesh upon that.
The first sentence is translated as: "The pains adjust in the main vein of the patient, and tighten up on the enlargement of the vein, after which you have made a note.
"The fracture site should be cleaned and extended so that no bleeding occurs, the doctor knows to prevent it from coming back; therefore, cover this with water tight dressing for three days; then after a little loosening of the bandage, you take nourishment by hand to the member, as recommended.
"When the restorers of a fractured member are not restored at first, then after some time and restoration with difficulty, it is an error second in the operation; great fear, as if they were wrong; but if this happened to enlarge the ancients in previous times free from pain and swelling.
"You do not have to visit it at all for what is reasonable that this does not occur.
"When a fracture occurs in the head:
"The signs of fractures vary, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct; except that some fractures do not come from a blow to the spleen, which can be caused by a stroke on it, as you say in its front part, so this kind is called the 'sword' one. If no part of the arm strikes the body without passing through the palm, and if there is no injury on the hand itself, then that kind of fracture is called absolute elevation.
When the joints are broken or have become stiff and painful, whether they are mild or severe, if there is a cause of pain or numbness in them, then it is customary for doctors to apply pressure on certain points
When the joint pain is caused by a penetrating fracture that approaches the nerve endings in or on the wrist bones, it is customary for doctors to apply pressure at certain points on the area of the broken joints, whether they are mild or severe.
When a joint pain is caused by a small capillary fracture in the delicate area of the finger, it is commonly referred to as a capillary fracture.
The fracture that is caused by pressing or hitting the affected finger and causing it to break through an opening in the skin, so that blood cannot reach the broken area, this type of fracture is commonly referred to as a fingertip amputation.
Additionally, it should be noted in the joints and bones that are mentioned earlier.
These various types of fractures have one thing in common - they all heal slowly due to the separation of the affected parts. And you will remember this on your own.
You will also be able to identify these types of fractures by observing them and investigating their causes, as well as determining the extent of any scarring that may result from them.
"A particular instrument is used to examine inside the body, and it is withdrawn once removed from the bone or joint affected by fracture.
In the examination of fracture also consider at first those accidents that are evident by a visible sign of fear, such as vomiting with rage and anguish, loss of understanding, lack of consciousness, dizziness, sudden fever, weakness in the limbs, and shortness of breath, it's all part of these symptoms of shock.
If you encounter accidents that are not current to your health, then examine the injury.
Where the cause is that it was caused by an injury to the first day of winter, then you should examine it every second day from that onwards as well.
If it is in the summer days, then you should examine it every seventh day and also check for any signs of foul play, accidents or injuries that may have occurred.
If the fracture has already happened through foul play and it is also accompanied by pain in both legs or feet, then you should examine closely for any signs of injury and report to your physician immediately.
The first sentence is "Here comes the translation.
If you are dealing with the patient's discharge of sputum or pus from an abscess, it is customary to take a pause as they often come in waves and bursts, so that if there should be any leakage of the abscess, one can ensure that no more such leakage occurs, and to prevent any further leakage by covering it. This happens at the incision site on both the front and back sides of the body.
The second sentence translates as "This is one out of two options for surgery.
One option is to insert a needle into the incision site so as to drain any remaining fluid, and this is how it should be done. And after that one administers another needle of smaller size than the previous one.
After administering the thinner needle, you administer a second needle:
You may need to use multiple needles of different sizes which are thinner than the others. And some of them should be thinner yet, so that they are as thin as possible and can be used directly or for feeling purposes only.
Use the thinnest needles to avoid piercing into the artery, which could lead to bleeding and damage of that area.
When the stomach is strong and hard, then you administer the pills in the vein of that person, which are called veins without depth
The vein is either at the extremity of that person's arm or side to prevent it from being submerged and passing through the orifice of the stomach.
It is convenient to administer pills of many different types depending on which suits the nature of each stomach, from those in front of a sharp arm or side up until you are at the back of the throat and around it.
The three types of pills are: 1) to pierce through the broken vein and place it over the stomach so that you know that the intestine has been penetrated; 2) then move the pill to another location, and wait for the amount of fat in the area or around it;
Then insert the veins into that space between each part of the stomach, and then gently place it over the area with fat or around it; if you feel any discomfort, you should either put your hand on top, or use a small pair of tweezers.
When you hold them securely so that they cannot cause any harm to your body
And when you pass through the orifice, and if there are no injuries to be treated with them, then remove it from your body, so that any injury or wounds may remain unchanged in its place of origin, like an incision
If there is no need for them to treat bones or joints and wounds, then take that from the instruments you have mentioned, and instead use it to heal the burns on the skin and remove any scars they may have mentioned
The other procedure is easier to perform but also more frightening. It consists of lifting the skin up and exposing the fracture which was broken with great force and evident, until you have exposed that part and have secured it in place so that this instrument will now stretch gently and joyfully from where this one's form:
The procedure for the lens fracture is first and cannot cause any harm, while the acute fracture is done in two stages: first on both sides of the body, then afterwards
Be sure to keep the instrument steady as you slowly turn it around so that no harm is caused in this procedure, and if there was a mistake or accident on one of them, be very careful, because they can cause pain.
When the gout is due to a cause that attaches itself to the edge of the foot, it will spread over the entire area of the affected foot and may even affect other toes on the same leg; therefore, the pain should be alleviated as quickly as possible by relieving this cause, for which relief must come from the relief of the discomforts or pains.
If the joint pain does not infiltrate into the foot, and it is necessary to determine whether there was a fracture or whether this particular area has become inflamed, you should examine that part carefully for any symptoms of inflammation, and then decide how to proceed from there based on your preparation of various options available.
When administering the medicine to this particular area, ensure that you use a suitable amount and proceed with caution as you would continue administering all of them simultaneously.
When it comes to any of the tiny capillary fractures or subtle fractures, when you determine that care must be taken for correction of this injury.
It is assumed that all those who have studied in that field already know about it. We will show you how to do this on fractures.
"When the patient vomits due to a blockage of the intestines, then cover him with a second sheet of gauze, immerse it in hot water and hold it over the opening of the stomach; apply another soaked cloth on top and let that soak into the first one while preventing leakage.
"Use this treatment for one or two days depending on how sure you are about the efficacy; then remove it and administer medicines as if they were unnecessary dryness remedies such as flaxseed oil and flour of eggs, and powder of these and powders of the same.
"Make sure to powder the medicines as if they were already powdered on the wound, and universally apply all of the medicine that is property of which has the power to cleanse without poisoning.
"Ensure that the wound in your care is clean; do not let it be infected or any other infection; nor do you add virulence to it; when adjusted over the patient's buttocks, cover and remove it, and apply a treatment for malignant evil.
"When you apply it to the head as well as when it is applied to the treatment of him/her, and it is darker on his/her surface; so consider that if an accident occurs due to these treatments then know that this could be extremely dangerous.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
When the nose is broken.
When the nose is broken and you have two nostrils that are both blocked or one of them is blocked while the other isn't, then it will cause pain and difficulty in breathing due to obstruction and constriction.
If one of the two nostrils is broken and you insert a piece into it to stop its bleeding, and make sure that you put on both sides as much as possible for them to align in position, so that the nose can return to its normal shape after being treated with care. And let this be done for you to make it easier and remember not to put your finger inside during the surgery on the patient's belly.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and there is no way to repair it, then let them align on both sides as much as possible at their small end.
When a fracture occurs in two parts, then let the physician handle it as such.
You should attempt to restore the limb on the first day of the fracture if possible; otherwise, apply a splint or cast.
In the case of a single fracture in one part, apply a dressing to it; if there are two fractures, place two splints and make sure they fit snugly on both ends of the nose.
Ensure that the splints are tightly fitting on both sides of the nose, and be removed daily if not in use; also ensure that they remain inserted while holding the bone firmly and allowing it to heal properly.
Splints should be placed inside the nose in addition to a cushion for support, lest there be any risk of swelling or injury from the dressing material around it; and also ensure that you cannot breathe out while there is pain or discomfort from the fracture.
This matter may not be necessary; if you wish to do so, go ahead and place them if you wish not, avoid doing so.
If any other splints are needed for another bone injury, place them inside the nose at the tip or bottom, ensuring they fit snugly and gently rounded off to avoid irritation from being pushed through; otherwise you may choose not to do so.
When it does not happen that the pointed stick is stuck in something hard and difficult to remove (like a stone), then lay down the foot on top of them [the patient] so they don't come out through their nose
When the bones of the nose are fractured or contorted in some way, then lay down a sheet on top of them, and stretch it out [the patient] as you would an instrument, so they don't come out through their nose.
If a plague occurs in the nose, then lay down on top of them [the patient] so they don't come out through their nose, and administer plum-filled catheters that are to be inserted into whatever part of their body is most suitable for treatment.
The end of this medical treatise.
When the jaw bone is broken
When the jaw bone is broken and the fracture is not infected (and thus cannot be opened), then keep the patient's mouth closed unless it is already fractured in two pieces and curved at its ends.
And so if the fracture is in the right side of the jaw, then you put an index finger into the patient's mouth on that side; and similarly if it is at the left side of the jaw, then the doctor puts his thumb there instead; to prevent the bone from slipping out through the opening.
"When a fracture of the jaw has been separated into two parts, it is customary for doctors to administer extensions of those parts separately in order that they may be properly united.
"If the teeth are loosened and disrupt the jaw, then apply strong bandages to those of which side one falls on or another, and place a large strap bandage over it gently, or if necessary only a single bandaged around the length of the jaw; and apply that when you have applied the strip above the jaw, and convenient application, so as not to be destroyed.
"Command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and pause the medication for a while.
"If the figure is altered in some way that you do not know about it, then tell her to take note of this and ask for the third time; and correct what has been changed on him/her gently, using oil or flour or other soft material, so as to cover over.
"When the plaster is properly placed and the condition of his/her hands does not change, then proceed with the application without delay so that it may be healed and strengthened in three sessions.
When another vein is opened to insert a needle for bloodletting, doctors administer this potion that has been prepared with the ingredients mentioned in the passage on the same day at dawn when the patient lies down and becomes relaxed, so as to make him sick
If a fracture is caused by a blow, doctors consider whether it is necessary to separate the bone or not, and they will advise you on how to apply those remedies in order to remedy that injury.
If the wounds of a blow are severe, doctors will recommend increasing the application frequency based on your need for treatment.
After you have applied those remedies and if they are not effective, doctors recommend checking the severity of the wound and choosing one of the plasters that can be used in this case to prevent any further complications or sickness.
.
Restoration of the collarbone when it is fractured.
The veins that were broken during surgery to the collarbone will cause weakness in the muscles, and this fracture may be treated by one of three methods.
It can be either separated or torn apart in two parts that are separate from each other and do not cause any harm to the patient, it is left to the surgeon for healing. Or alternatively, if this occurs during the procedure as well but causes difficulty in healing of the bone, then the fracture must have occurred separately, causing a more severe injury.
The operation in that case is when the fracture occurs within the pleura, it should be performed by two surgeons to ensure that one has the attendant and guides the broken rib, while another extends the incision at that point.
The bone should be fractured in a way so that it is directed towards the second part of its shape and not towards the small or concave part.
If you want to extend it further, the doctors recommend that you use either cloth or wool as a wrapping for the patient's arm, and make sure the surface is equal in size with your need; then stretch and lift the rib cage while keeping one hand inside so that the fracture occurs when desired.
If you cannot move the arm of the rib cage to outside the body, for fear it may be dangerous, have the patient lie on their back and place a cushion under one shoulder blade just slightly larger than the other.
The minister should lift the muscle of that rib to outside where it would normally be in front, and then have the surgeons perform the fracture and guide it towards those areas.
If you feel pain in your ribs or shoulder blades, the doctors recommend to stretch and loosen those areas gently for ease of movement.
If you hold the pharynx open with one of the instruments that have been used for this purpose, then it is necessary to loosen or remove that instrument.
It is similar to the opening of which cavity? The pharynx
The length of the larynx may vary depending on which extremity is operated upon or if there are two different extremities involved in the surgery.
If the disruption of the larynx that you have caused when removing the saddle is complete, then it is certain to close both flaps with sutures.
If the disruption is minimal or if you are uncertain whether sutures should be used, then cover the flap with gauze and powder to control bleeding from a cut in the flap.
If you need to apply pressure to stop bleeding, then cover it with a clean cloth and oil, and place something over that.
When the bone is broken above the mouth; and to see if there is a fistula in any day, when the ligament becomes slack or falls off the stone already be corrected
And place the cushion of the patient on his lower back, and also put the titillation on his buttocks to lie down in it for some time, so that this may be elevated the attendant's head from beneath him towards the latz level; then elevate the fracture of the ribcage upwards towards the muscle. Or you can lift up your arms towards the shoulder of them
If it does not happen within twelve days
And if you see the face of him like that, adjust it in its structure and restore it so that it is restored and coagulated with the fracture of the rib cage.
It is strengthened and comforted after twenty-eight days, and some vegetables are eaten to pass the time that day.
That's all!
Reconstruction of the shoulder fracture
The spatula is broken in the lower part of him, and not from his body but just on the edges.
When it is broken at the location of him - and is broken in the middle part of him - and not understood but by touch, doctors will consider that as the figure of the fracture may require adjustment to bring it back into alignment with natural figures in any way you can do with engineering skills.
And place a pause over the area of the sharp blade, and another pause on powdered silk; and then place a pause above the table cloth in proportion to the size of the spatula whole or less
Then place a pause over the area of the concave surface of the spatula, and then fill that space with the stop blade, aligning them in proportion to one another.
Ensure that the distance between each of your fingertips is even, and do not let them move beyond their individual space.
Consider each day as a separate unit of measurement; and all the measurements should be softened, another measure for each, and then fill in or align with one another if they are out of their space.
Place the patient on his back.
The spatula is restored in twenty days or less than that.
When you have completed this number of measurements, then break the measurement and ensure that it is from the bones for which the beginning was not broken or dissolved.
If you have already placed the bone in position and secured it with a cord, then loosen that cord, remove it, and thereafter ensure that it is as if there were no such fracture of the furcula or sternum mentioned earlier.
When joints are afflicted by cold humors that spread throughout the body, causing pain in the feet, it is customary among physicians for such cases to be called gout.
Restoring of a hernia or bowel injury
The intestines should be returned to their original position, and the doctor must ensure that both legs are kept apart from each other, in order to prevent any recurrence of the injury.
When the intestine is torn and falls out of its cavity it causes severe pain, difficulty in breathing, weakness, numbness, coolness, and sometimes paralysis or death. It is declared at the site where it was torn but not concealed from sensation.
The restoration of it is that the patient should be placed on their back and a cushion under them. A cushion between the thighs must also be used to prevent recurrence or any other complications arising from the surgery.
Carefully place it on the mattress and remove any cushion beneath that may be uncomfortable or cold. If you are using a blanket, cover the torn area to prevent infection; and make sure there is no swelling at all times. Make sure to monitor its position regularly during healing, especially if there was a significant injury.
When the patient has experienced a spillage or effusion of bile into the location, you should remove it from there and eliminate the abscess by removing its contents and rectifying this by means of care for that region of body.
Chapter VIII
Restoration of the spine when it is ruptured.
If the fracture of the spine does not occur at a single point, but rather in several places that are distant from each other; and if this is accompanied by symptoms in the extremities which cause them to be torn, it will happen as a result of these cracks. The understanding of him is not obscured by ignorance and his intellect remains sharp due to this investigation.
The restoration is as follows: if the fracture occurs alongside a possible weakness due to a cause that has been established separately and causes it to weaken at its base, then close and strengthen the broken bones after removing the damaged parts.
If the fracture of the spine is gradually weakening and accompanied by violent pain and puncturing injuries that occur as if they had been caused there where the pleurisy was present and through this cause a difficulty in breathing, vomiting, and a difficult cure.
"The surgeon begins his work in that manner.
"He then says that he must inflate and expand the abdomen so that it is flat and extended, and the fracture is pulled away from the edges.
"If this is not the cause of a gout attack, if it happens anyway; and if it does happen, then doctors help with that.
"They would do well to let the abdomen rest and apply heat with hot towels; it is customary to reason that such application prevents the superfluous fluids from escaping through weakness.
"They would do well to let the place be covered with a hot cloth that has been soaked in hot water, and spread thin layers of powder between the thighs so that it is full, such as when you pull up your leg; apply some poultice for pain control, and medicine.
"If the patient suffers very strong pain that does not subside and pain occurs at the site of the fracture, then doctors say to apply pressure on the place torn open by the injury, spread thin layers between the thighs, and hold firmly a certain instrument used for stitching up.
Open both thighs of the patient, if great, tighten them up, and treat that area with a plaster inside to be healed
If the abscess is located in that area, then place powders soaked in a fragrant oil and cover it with a cloth to prevent spreading
Place a bandage over the affected area to prevent bleeding
Certainly.
Fracture repair of the spine from both sides and the pelvis
Any broken bones in the lower part of the body, such as the pelvis, should be treated similarly to spinal fractures. If it is determined that the fracture is severe and extends to parts of the body that are not protected by bones or muscles, such as the skull, spine or limbs, then those areas cannot be moved or straightened without causing further damage, which may lead to death.
If the bone is not broken and there are no visible injuries or damage to those areas mentioned earlier, then medical treatment will be successful in healing the bone.
If you are asking if it is necessary to have surgery on the spine from both sides as well, then medical considerations will be taken into account for that part of the body.
When joint pain occurs frequently and becomes severe, when the gout strikes in its most devastating form on one or both legs, then you know that it is fatal and cannot be controlled by medicine alone.
If there are no other causes involved, the cause of gout is more severe and common.
The treatment for gout is to apply a pointed cautery over the swollen joint or foot, usually at the heel or big toe, and leave it on until blisters form under it.
When the blisters have formed and healed, stretch over it gently as before, and tell the patient to rest and be calm, not sleeping on the part where pain occurs until it feels better.
If there are no other causes involved and the gout has settled in one or both of the legs, apply a poultice to that joint/leg and cover it with clean cloth, if large enough. Cover any blisters formed on top of that cloth as well. Gently stretch over affected area until pain subsides.
If the gout has settled in one or both of your legs and it is at an end, apply poultice to that joint/leg as before, cover it with a clean cloth if large enough. Cover any blisters formed on top of that cloth too. Gently stretch over affected area until pain subsides.
When a person has broken veins in it, the pain is located on that part of the body and remains there until treatment begins to heal,
"Capitol
Restoration of circulation.
When the bones of the arteries are broken and if they are broken, then the fracture of their is only communication in the extremities of those and is inscribed at the length and decline to the edges; and happens to the patient's pain in the place and puncture, and the artery becomes paralyzed when it is fractured.
Restoration of circulation involves spreading your hand over the fracture area so that it covers the shape of the limb.
If the fracture is only in one extremity, then you need to apply something similar to normal shape on that limb to restore circulation.
If the fracture is in the abdomen or has declined to the edges of those areas, then you should apply something similar to normal shape on the patient's belly as preparation for restoring that fracture. Once you have prepared that area and applied the dressing over it, then place a bandage on top of that dressing or gauze, hold it in place with tape to prevent any puncture of the fracture or slippage from the plaster.
When a cavity is found between the patient's thighs, place cushions under them and have them lie on their back with their legs apart so that they do not press against each other, and command the patient to sleep on his side or the other side as desired.
If the cautery is painful, then stop excising it and its restoration until it has been settled by cauterizing that part next as described before; and afterwards return to the restoration of it, straining with care as much as possible.
If this happens in the sacrum or any other part mentioned before, then do what was previously described.
Chapter XI
Restoration of the fracture of the arm.
The arm is where it is between the shoulder and the top of the shoulder blade.
If it is broken, then the restoration of it will be one of two ways. One way is to set up a splint in such a manner as described before;
And if there are two limbs and they both need the same treatment, then have it suspended from one of them elevated.
And have the patient lie on his back; and afterwards gently place their broken arm down so that it is aligned with the curve of the forearm as attached to its curvature.
When the cause of severe pain arises from any part of the body, let the physician extend it to the places where he can, and when the fracture returns after that, stop.
The second servant's task is to place the other hand on his patient, and extend it towards the fracture site in order to assist him while he attends to the broken limb with his other hand.
If you want to strengthen the traction, the doctor will apply pressure both on the fracture and also on another part of the body at the same time, with each servant extending his own limbs in two directions.
If the fracture is close to the end of a limb, the servant should place his hand on top of the other and put pressure there as well in order to hold it firmly while he extends towards the fracture site with the other hand.
Similarly if the fracture is close to a joint, he should place his hand on top of it and also hold it there while extending towards the fracture site with the other hand as well.
With ease and agility in mind, if a servant finds that the traction is being applied properly, he should continue to apply pressure without interruption unless some sort of obstruction occurs or until otherwise instructed by the doctor.
"When the arrow pierces through, and pauses at the tip of the shaft, it should be removed immediately, or else it will cause pain.
"The manner in which to remove it is by gently placing a cushion over the fracture and wrapping it with cloth from beneath. Then place your hand on top of this protector and hold tight onto its muscles.
"After removing the cloth gently place your hand on top of the protector and hold tight onto its arm to ensure it is in the correct position, or else risk causing damage.
"The arrow's use is done.
"After removing the cloth and placing it over the fracture with all its might, pause between each of the steles to determine their correct position, based on both the length and the latitude.
"Place your hand gently over the first stele at the beginning of the capital.
"The placement of your hand on top of the location of the fracture should be very firm and secure. "When placing over a fractured area, the strength of the pressure must be less than when pressing down on healthy skin.
"If you find yourself in a situation where the steles and pressure seem to be causing harm instead of healing, then remove them immediately.
When the patient's buttocks are spread open, let the physician tighten the area to be examined and stretch any tight bands as much as possible on that day.
After three days to prevent bruising or swelling, it is forbidden for the bandage to be removed while there is excess tightness in that area. And after saying this, correct all of these instructions as well.
If you are sure that there is no cause for this, then the bandage will be loosened after three days or more as needed.
And let them sleep on their side and place a pillow between their knees to support their stomach.
After removing the stitches and applying adhesive bandages completely soaked in lanolin, remember to check every hour during the night or day that no torn part of their body is still swollen or loose, then correct this as needed according to your expertise.
After removing the patient's bandage according to our instructions earlier, make sure that it is mild as soon as it comes in contact with them and tighten it gradually. And after saying this, let us know if you have any concerns about its tightness.
The adhesive bandage on the wound and the pillow should be tight for at least two weeks, after which they will be loosened up a bit and treated with Band-Aid and medicine as needed to correct any issues that may arise.
When there is a fracture, it will take time to heal or you may have to wear a brace for two months.
Section 12
Treatment of a broken arm.
The arm is composed of two bones that are called the humerus and radius; of which one is small, being the ulna, and the other large being the radius.
If only the larger bone (the humerus) is broken, or if only the smaller one (the ulna), then it will be easier for you to break them in half.
When the smaller bone (the ulna) is broken, healing and recovery will be easier than when only the larger one (the humerus) is broken.
If both bones are broken at once, it makes recovery difficult and healing takes longer.
When two bones are broken simultaneously, it is bad luck.
If the bone that was broken is the smaller one (the ulna), it's advisable for a doctor to perform surgery and restore it as quickly as possible so that it can heal well without any trouble.
If the larger bone (the humerus) is broken, then you will need surgery to restore it as soon as possible so that healing can occur well without any trouble.
When two needles are stuck together, then the doctor should gently remove them both.
After the removal of the fist and its extension on a cushion, place both hands as shown, and put them on their ears, then gently remove all other fingers except for those used to make the incision, so that they may be sewn up, unless otherwise specified in this text.
And when a cushion is placed under him at the top or bottom of his body, then it should be such that he does not catch hold.
Then extend the arms of both doctors as shown, with the left hand on the patient's right side and vice versa.
And if you are to remove a second incision along that same line (as indicated), then the doctor should perform it in the usual way, as specified here.
If a thread on his body is too short or tangled up, then the doctor should perform this procedure to remove all the excess in that area of his own accord.
If it appears separated and is not to your advantage in removing the abscess, then you should gently cover him over and spread that second membrane as shown by our doctors.
If the fracture is already open, then you should proceed to the next step immediately and take care of it as specified in this text.
When the first incision is made in your restoration, you lay a cloth soaked in hot and cold oil onto it, which must be between thick and thin, and hold it over that area of stricture so as to prevent the abscess from coming out; afterwards, cover it with a prepared poultice of powdered mullein, and put a pause on the dressing.
You understand that there are two types of stitches - major and minor ones?
After the incision is made in the area of the fracture but before it is closed, pause the closure to allow for memory of that location at the beginning of this chapter?
The dressings on the fracture should be soft and not too tight or too loose; it is important to find a balance between thickness and size as we have recommended?
Consider the member of which you are referring? If there is any cause for which correction is necessary, whether it occurs to the member or elsewhere, then make sure that you break into the member just above where this problem ceases?
When the member is inside but restrained
If the hernia has been reduced and the opening is already closed to those who are present, then you will rectify everything as usual.
Consider it if nutrition is prohibited to enter the member due to excess of hernia pressure, that you should soften it a little and let it out for a few days until it runs away from there in order to nourish it again.
If the patient does not encounter any causes of those mentioned earlier, then you should keep it restrained for at least 20 days or until otherwise notified.
Then place your hand under the patient's arm to keep it still and let them sleep on their side.
You know that the fracture is restored in 30 days or within 42 days, and if it's longer than that then you follow the instructions provided with the complex and conditions of healing.
The fourteenth chapter
Of restoration of fractures of arms and legs.
You know that the arm bone or leg bones should be fractured in order to heal, and they will not occur except with care taken.
When an arm fracture or dislocation occurs, the doctors say that the patient should keep moving and maintain rest for the next 48 hours while lying on their arm raised above their chest.
The surgeon extends his hand to help the patient's body, so that it can be cut open in a good manner and with proper care
The doctor says to remove the bandage and cover it if any bleeding occurs, and place a second bandage on top of that
If the hernia is in the belly of the finger, and the doctor wants to remove the bandage from his hand, then command the patient to stretch that hand with a bandaged finger.
The cloth over which the body is applied shall be thin enough to apply it to the palm of the hand, then stretch that second one out.
If the fracture is in the forefinger area, then remove one bandage from the palm of the hand and apply another on top of that, so that the arm will be stretched straight out and not crooked between the fingers.
If the fracture occurs in one of the fingers that are not the forefinger area, then remove both bandages and place them on top of each other to stretch it out fully, but if you want, pause a little bit to elevate the fracture and prevent further damage.
If the fracture is in one of the other fingers like that on the thumb, or ear, or nose, or ring finger, then stretch it out by placing both bandages together to make a band and place it on top of those places; if you want to continue stretching further, do so but pause with a small bandage over them; otherwise, remove one bandage from each and place them back where they were.
In your treatment, and if that happens, place a pointed cautery against the arrow of your operation, and when you find any cause mentioned in this account
Chapter 14
For treatment of fractures of bones.
The bone of the thigh is broken and it is declared second that it has become part of the healing process, accompanied by swelling.
The treatment is made by placing a splint over the fracture and another by keeping it, and the patient's abdomen is propped up on one side, facing toward the face.
Extend the splint to its full extent after quality assurance when the fracture has been immobilized in place on the bone.
When it is necessary to apply the splint on the thigh, place it in front of the broken part of the abdomen for support and prevent its escape from the leg.
Similarly if it is necessary to apply the splint on the arm, place it in front of the broken part and prevent its escape from the leg.
Place the patient's hand on your chest and gently press it so that their arm is kept in place during surgery as closely to normal as possible, or else risk damaging the joint. When an arrow falls into the body, pain occurs at that point for some days until the arrow is extracted and returned to your care.
This restriction is as follows: cover the fracture with something hard, and fold that over it two or three times, and wipe away any excess fluid; and cover the chest inside so that blood does not come out through the chest area
Between the chest and the limb place it at the lower end of the two parts; and have its extremities placed so that they are opposite to both sides, and wrap around the chest and the area over which excess fluid flows from the object
And place a cushion at that spot of the fracture there, and on those a stone over the opening of the chest area.
And place a cloth between the chest and the cup to seal the gap
And when the pain from a severe fracture is located in that area three or four times wrapped around it, and as long as you hold onto the place of the fracture your restriction will be less painful and looser
And extend the two limbs of the servant to both sides until it reaches around the leg from below and stretch both extremities of the other side in such a way that the line does not go away from its place.
When the hernia is restored over that part of their body, then let it be so that no injury occurs to any member by strangulation or effusion; and if such an event does occur, then make haste to apply remedies against this event after saying words favorable to the good will of God.
If the pain is caused by heat in the bowels that has penetrated there, then let it be so that you hold it off until it is possible to do; otherwise, go over it and cure what came before, after having remembered its cause for remembrance of this thing being a health matter
And some words are strong enough to mend this fracture of the thigh over there where they have been adjusted with linen and such like in the arm.
However in the restoration of it this way a fault does not occur to the patient's claudication; and if it is restored alone, then another bandage should be applied after that, so that the other limb will remain silent for now.
You know that the thigh is strained in a few days or one month or one week and so it depends on the diversity of complications and other circumstances.
The conclusion
The restoration of the fracture in the heel.
When the thigh bone breaks through the skin, it causes swelling in the muscles below
When there is a fracture in the thighbone, it can cause a tear or wound on its parts, and this may be accompanied by pain as well, and over time, such an injury becomes inflamed or sore, making it painful to move around.
The restoration of such an injury involves first making a second incision between the parts, which is then closed in order to facilitate and simplify the healing process.
Then place a round pedestal over it, if necessary, so that one can see it clearly and easily; and stretch out your arm to reach for this stone conveniently.
Then consider all the measures that were taken in previous fractures, such as applying cold and similar to those in this case so that the treatment is effective when it comes to preventing accidents like this one from happening again.
This is the end of a medieval medical treatise written in Latin-influenced languages.
The restoration of a broken bone.
In the thighbone there are two bones: one is thicker and is called the femur; the other is thinner and is known as the tibia.
When the two bones of the arm are broken together in this way, and for such a fracture as well, then the restoration process is carried out similarly to that of the leg, making it one operation.
When two bones are separated, the cavity becomes filled entirely.
If you gently pull the bone apart, the cavity will be opened again
If you forcibly separate the bones violently, then those causes are not to your advantage
After providing assistance with respect and care towards others, it is beneficial to establish connections and relationships accordingly.
If the separation of bones causes severe and persistent pain that is not alleviated by gentle care or assistance, then you should consult a doctor for advice and help.
If the cavity is not an indication for surgical intervention and if you complete all necessary procedures, then your pain will be alleviated; except from those that are very small and without cause, which do not need any treatment or cure; as well as those whose length is proportional to the size of the cavity itself but shorter than the bone itself.
After wrapping around the bone in two parts and placing one on either side of the opening at each end of it, close off with a small piece of cloth over both ends to prevent the bones from coming out.
The two bones are wrapped around in three places on each side and at the middle, so that when stretching the cavity it is forbidden to touch both ends with either hand separately; this for proper alignment of the bone.
When administering a pessary to the thighs, it is necessary to place a cushion beneath them and another one on their legs in order to prevent the pessary from moving around.
Additionally, if you break this, do so carefully.
When you administer this pessary on any given day and study it closely for the next few days, pay attention to any swelling, inflammation or other such causes; if you notice any of these, your doctor should stop administering it immediately so that it does not cause harm.
Chapter Seventeen.
Of the fracture of the foot and the bones of the leg, as well as the fingers.
The foot does not always break in its entirety; sometimes the bones of the leg break and occasionally the fingers do as well; however, they rarely break separately, only tearing apart near where the fingers are used most frequently.
If fractures occur in the bones of the leg and sometimes these bones are elevated above one another; doctors must place a cushion beneath their feet on the ground so that they can move around as before.
And then place the foot over this which is elevated by those bones, and hold them in position; if you break or lose one of these, put it back into its proper place.
When you have opened up space between the patient's thighs using cushions beneath them, another servant to place on their legs, and yet another to support their chest with hands, here comes the first sentence.
The servant should now straighten up and wrap a bandage around their foot, making sure to include any other factors that may have contributed to the pain as well.
After three or four days of pain, the servant should loosen it up and try to straighten their joints, whether they are twisted or dislocated; this operation must be done with utmost care in these cases as well.
If the joints are sore and stiff, then the servant should restore them by massaging them gently as recommended in the treatment of the hands' joints. After positioning the affected joint at its correct length and ensuring it is firmly in place on that table as recommended, straighten up that area carefully.
If the joints are sore and stiff for two or three days, then the servant should place a cushion beneath that joint on the table with its side closest to their stomach; hold it firmly in place against one of the heads of the table so that there is support from the belly as well.
It is important to remember that you should not forget all the causes of injury mentioned in other fractures cases, and stop all treatment at this point as well.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customary to call gout among doctors.
The fracture of the thigh bone and the pelvis area are usually called a broken hip or dislocated hip by doctors
When the thigh bone is broken, the doctor often makes an incision in the crease below it and approaches from behind it to place it back into position properly
If the thigh bone is cut through and through, approach it as you would do with one that has been separated, and elevate both legs slowly until this condition is corrected if possible
Place powders on both legs to help absorb the urine and make urination easier, reduce swelling, and return it back into its original position
Repeat this for seven days or more until it is restored.
If you want to use a catheter, insert it into the urethra and enter the bladder through that channel, apply gentle pressure with the catheter tip until the bladder is inflated enough for the bone to return properly if the fracture occurs.
Then apply a bandage and stay there for as many days your doctor recommends until you are healed
When a man's or woman's penis is circumcised, doctors provide anesthesia and analgesia to the area where they recommend it in the previous sentence.
In such cases where the fracture is recent and not severe enough to require immediate surgery, rather than that one would recommend it immediately in healing and tightening of the joint, they should consider other treatments available instead.
In a man when he is circumcised, you should wash the wound with salt water, cover it and keep it covered for three days or until healed.
The 19th chapter of the Capitularia, an important work on Roman law that was compiled by Emperor Justinian
In repairing a broken bone when it is already bruised
It is more convenient to treat the fracture if it is accompanied by bruising or swelling in the area of the organ such as the thigh, arm, or leg, and if those conditions are present you should be cautious about applying any treatments that could exacerbate the condition like phlebotomy (bleeding).
If the swelling is severe, doctors advise against applying anything to the wound unless you are removing something that has already been broken.
When a fracture occurs in that manner, do not delay it further if another accident should happen
If an accident occurs on the same day as the restoration, then perform the restoration within 24 hours and do not postpone it to another day unless absolutely necessary, because you risk making additional accidents.
If the bone is about to break through the skin and you suspect this, then try to reduce it by gently pressing on both sides of it as much as possible without causing further harm.
If the injury is not prepared or balanced well, then try to reduce it with your strongest hand as much as possible in that direction; and stretch out until you have reached the length of seven digits or eight inches, whichever is greater, and from there measure its latitudinal extent relative to its longitudinal extent. This will be necessary for the doctor to determine how many centimeters should go towards healing this particular type of fracture.
And do not let the tension build up too much that it could be a problem during surgery.
And if there is an acutely damaged part of the body that has margins around its extremities, and the swelling or edema of it towards all directions, then do so with great care.
The beginning of this text can be translated as follows:
In Greek, it translates to "the pain is unbearable.
Because the extremity of that person has been raised above their own prominent extremity.
He raises him to a certain height and then places his arm on it without any further adornment.
If the limb is fractured and if it's very small, then you should put a splint on that extremity to prevent further damage.
If you cannot reduce the arm to that extent as we suggested, then put it on one of those rolls that we mentioned earlier or place it onto another roll that is easily accessible for you.
Put a strip around the arm to prevent further swelling and redness.
Once the arm has been reduced and you apply the reduction ointment to the swelling and redness, doctors will know that it is too late to return to its natural location unless they act very quickly.
Once your restoration is complete and you have covered the arm with a black strip of cloth as well as in summer or if it is not in winter and does not touch any surface that may cause oil, then prevent its sticking to the wall by placing something under it to hold it down.
"When a hernia is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and pain occurs in the feet, it is customary to call gout.
"Please be very careful not to stretch the hernia while it is still broken; otherwise, if it occurs at a crucial time or in an inappropriate place, such as during a fight or argument, it may lead to injury. "If the same tightness of joints occurs with the same frequency and in similar places as joint fractures do.
"If the hernia is large or painful and you are concerned about accidents that might occur and feel pain in the area, do not leave it uncovered, place a hard dressing over the incision to prevent infection.
"If you have already applied the dressing once or twice and it comes off easily, place a second dressing on top of the one that was previously placed over the area where it came off from, and apply cold water every few hours as recommended by our custom.
"You should gently remove the dressing and consider the hernia to be stable and healed when it is solid and firm, and make sure that the member is prepared in such a way that any protrusion will not occur through the incision.
When the plague passes through days and is neither consolidated nor removed from the body, doctors are aware of it coming to an end in a short time Those who are separated and retracted from there or not separated and penetrate the member cause pain to perform a sharp incision those for whom it is possible
If the plague comes or goes away, it is temporary, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, doctors know that it will end in due time.
When the plague strikes you and your legs are numb, then lie on your back with your knees drawn up to your chest, like this for large limbs, without drawing attention to it or removing it as long as nothing comes out of it, doctors will treat it accordingly if they find it, but otherwise let them pass.
The plague capital
Treatment for the injury
Treatment for the injury
When the bowel obstruction is recent and supplied with those medicines that have been prescribed as well, look at them, listen to their murmur, and pay attention to their appearance; see if they are from one source or many sources, examine their consistency, odor, color, and size; consider whether you should take them all together, mix them in a bowl of water, swallow them all down, pause before swallowing them into the throat, and ensure that there is no obstruction for the food to pass through.
In case you suspect a blockage from the esophagus, do not force it down days later; instead, take it and try another one after some time. If the obstruction is still present, tighten the flap of the throat gently, so that the obstruction may be eased out.
If the obstruction is in your throat and it needs to be removed immediately, have a servant take it out gently from under your chin, without causing any injury or pain to you, and remove any excess fluids that may cause harm.
Chapter 21
When restoring a fracture, it is important to approach the healing process gently and allow nature to take its course.
When restoring a fracture, there are several causes to consider: one is excessive tightness of the ligaments and joints that may prevent further healing or restrict mobility in some way; another cause could be excessive fluid restriction which prevents food from passing through the member; another could be excess lubrication; yet another could be unnecessary movement during the healing process. Finally, a lack of pain relief and weakness in the patient's chest can also hinder the recovery
"You have to carefully apply this medication on the patient, and it should be rubbed into their chest, making sure that the amount of it is distributed evenly.
"Place the pillow over their member to prevent any movement that could interfere with nourishment or continued application of medication, returning it to its normal shape.
Chapter xxii
"When bones are broken and it is necessary to restore them, they must be forbidden from undergoing further operations of that kind.
"When a member has already been restored to health from its injury and strength returned to the broken bone, it is allowed for that member to undergo its normal operation. However, one must not allow another member of an entirely new broken bone.
"The physicians and restorers who have done this in our time, may their practice be cursed with great fear of that kind which is fatal.
"When recent claudication or nodication occurs, it is customary to bind the affected member with a damp towel in order to soften and soothe them gently; as well as apply warmth from above and below, and also have those placed on their belly and chest respectively; and put it on that place too.
Some veins are dissolved by cold fluids that run through the most humid parts of the body and move throughout it during all hours.
The tortuous veins become enlarged and converted into ulcers when necessary care is not taken to treat them promptly. They are dissolved if the ulcer is not treated, and they may be accompanied by a discharge of fine matter from subtle pores, causing discomfort in that area.
The [section/chapter] thirty-three (33)
This is the beginning of a sermon on dislocation.
Dislocation is the destruction of some of the joints in that location so as to prevent motion, causing a lump on the member and bringing about great pains and injuries.
Therefore when dislocation occurs, doctors must make every effort to reduce it as soon as possible and not let time pass by without reducing the dislocation lest it be difficult later on for that reduction of dislocation to occur.
And thus do not let it be that the reduction is done in haste and without care lest spasms and pains follow.
When that occurs, doctors should apply to the patient a cure for gout, and also place something moist between their legs to keep them moist, and also reduce it with ease.
When each part of the body has been infiltrated by cold humors causing joint pain, especially in the feet, it is commonly known as gout among doctors
You already opened up space between the patient's thighs, placed cushions underneath them, another servant on their legs and another on their chest holding onto their hands.
The twelfth chapter.
Care for dislocation of the mandible (lower jaw).
If the lower jaw is dislocated and cannot be returned to its place with a slight force or by removing a small part of it, then it must be separated further so that saliva does not come out; if after separation from the mouth, tongue must still be covered inside the mouth.
When dislocation is slight, doctors return to their original position with a small force.
If the dislocation is complete and complicated, then it must be reduced immediately by skilled surgeons who will not wait for too long
The minister holds the patient's head, and the surgeon puts their thumb in the mouth to control it if there is only one dislocation or both thumbs inside as long as they are able to hold them properly; then the surgeon places the mandible back into its place.
When it is difficult to reduce them, and especially if the jaws are very loose or dislocated, the doctor will administer a solution of water and oil into their mouth, so that they can swallow the reduction easily without difficulty
Once the jaws are returned and aligned as much as possible, do not open the patient's mouth too wide, the doctor will put a cloth soaked with oil onto them to facilitate swallowing the reduction gently.
The patient should lie on their back with the head between two pillows to ensure that they cannot move suddenly or to one side without being guided; have a pillow placed under their chin as well, for comfort and support.
This is when it has been administered easily and the jaws are in good condition.
If the reduction of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and not converted to their correct position, doctors will administer a purge with hot water, salt water, and vinegar, as well as heat pads for belly, as well as heating pad for coldness and vomiting.
When you do this, the doctor will tell you that they have lost it; and if you are experiencing this for more than two days in a row, then you should consult with another doctor.
"When pain arises from cold humors infiltrating each part of the body, as when it occurs in the feet.
Translation: To reduce or prevent dislocation of the shoulder blade and extremity of the muscle.
Translation: The furcula does not dislocate from below due to its continuous contact with the chest; and some vertebrae are dislocated at the start of the process, which is known as the feeling of being lifted up
Translation: The restoration or healing of it involves placing the patient on their back and extending their limbs. Translation: And if you tightly hold down the area with a strong grasp so that it returns.
Translation: Then place your hand over this surface and dust, and firmly press it down.
Translation: When the extremity has been cut open and continues with it without dislocation occurring on any day, then the pain is reduced or prevented from happening as you mentioned earlier and secondly when you hold down their hand.
Translation: Then place your hand over this surface and dust; press it firmly down and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest so that they feel well.
Translation: The reduction in the pain of the muscle extremity occurs when it is separated from its location
"When the pain arises from excessive heat, as when it occurs in the feet.
Translation: To reduce or prevent dislocation of the muscle.
The first sentence translates to "The muscle is not dislocated but rather in three ways, one of which it may be dislocated at the beginning/start of the thread and another at the end.
The second sentence translates to "And the second is that it may be dislocated at the start of the muscle, and this occurs frequently; but it is not dislocated at the back part by the shoulder; nor is it dislocated in front parts through nerves.
The last sentence translates to "And most of all it is dislocated at the start parts of the thread, and frequently occurs in those where there are few veins; however, when it happens in those where the fat cells are present, then it is very difficult.
The last sentence translates to "In the unfortunate case of a sudden impact or collision that is made directly on it, and if this has been dislocated then immediately tighten/clamp it.
The last sentence translates to "And now that you are on top of the treatment for him/her, proceed in the care of them.
The last sentence translates to "You can distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the normal one by feeling for these various manifestations; you place your finger in the head of the concave muscle at which point it must touch the chest hair below, so that a hand cannot reduce its size or stretch over all movements.
When joints are dislocated, place a cushion on them, and the pains will subside immediately, without any delay.
The dislocation should be reduced as quickly as possible when it is fresh and the patient is young.
The reduction is done by placing the hand of the patient on their chest, and holding them tightly with both hands while extending it above where it should be placed, the minister places his hand over it as well to prevent its return.
If what has been said does not return or if it is the beginning of a dislocation, then days should be avoided, and pain must be administered by breaking up with cold water, soothing and linifying so that cuts may heal quickly, making them smooth, while avoiding cuts from swelling, softening and melting in water.
The patient is placed on their back with their feet elevated and the doctor holds their head in order to prevent it from falling while also lifting up their arm above where they want the joint reduced or stretched out.
If you want to reduce that joint with another method: and it is necessary for the patient's spouse to enter from the side of his buttocks into their abdomen, where they place a finger over the affected joint of the patient while supporting them above in order to hold the joint down. When a patient lies down, pain occurs between their thighs, therefore holding it tightly prevents further dislocation of the joint.
Another way to reduce pain is by placing the patient's head on a cushion of appropriate size and shape, such as one with a pillow placed underneath it to prevent suffocation, so that their legs are positioned over it; then extend both arms from the other part of the body towards where the joint should return.
If it is difficult to reduce pain due to all the causes mentioned earlier, then doctors use this treatment: and take a cushion that has a length of two fists (approximately 14 inches or about half a meter), and its height should be four times as long.
Make sure the cushion covers their head to prevent it from slipping off.
Then place the cushion over their chest and put one arm on top of it to rest both arms there, covering the area between them with another hand or finger placed at its edge as well.
Then place both arms on top of each other at the height specified and put one arm or finger between them as well to hold it in place securely.
The first sentence translates to: With the complete disintegration of each one in every possible manner that suits you, and after pausing, place a pillow over them as much as you want; and prepare for preventing from the pole of molly from this, and also the album on top of everything muscle, so it will be revolved by them, and tie up the leg of him to the column of him, and leave it, but not to hurt the leg of him per seven days.
After pausing briefly with the member of patient in comfort, once it is healed, you will guide him to the treatment of his illness.
Give the bandage a big one or two, and exercise it with some movements; if it is tight but not loose, then doctors have already done so
If the joint is dislocated due to heat or another cause, then it should be treated with three cuts, after which a dressing of cautery will be applied in its capital
If all this is done and the joint and ligament are not tight, then loose them gradually over time, do not tighten it too much or make it tight; otherwise, you will know that the nerves of him, which are at the top of the muscle, will be injured, crushed or elongated, and may not be fixed in place.
"From the dislocation of that which you have spread open to release the bowels and buttocks or behind the legs, reduction is necessary with a swift impulse so that it returns.
"Then apply ointment on the other restriction, and cure this one to be healed.
"And if you see the swelling of the member and delay in its movement, then apply lotion to reduce swelling and restore back to normal.
This is likely referring to Chapter 27 of a larger work.
"For the treatment of dislocation.
"The joint of the thigh is dislocated with great difficulty and returns to greater difficulty; when it is dislocated on both sides, mostly at the front side as behind, and its dislocation cannot be healed by touch or movement because this joint is concave and cannot bend the arms, nor touch against that muscle.
"And you say that the dislocation must be reduced as soon as possible to prevent further complications such as burns and frostbite; when it is a cauterized dislocation, if there are, difficult reduction of the joint occurs, and great pain occurs with all other types of dislocations, and many cases death.
When the restoration is possible to reduce it, extend the leg with both legs wide apart and expand your arms, so that the surgeon can see clearly inside the joints or the palm of his hand before turning back into place
When dislocation occurs on the parts of the day and night, then return to double spread your arms as wide as possible inside so that you can cut into the palm area
If dislocation cannot be reduced at all, then administer violent stretching and strong massage.
And two servants extend your arms as wide as possible to prevent you from being stretched out.
Then return your arms to their full range of motion, and place a folded blanket on the leg as well.
When the surgeon touches your hand at the joint, then apply something to make it slippery and easy for him/her to move around inside that joint quickly and return it back in place.
Then place the reduction on a cushion which has stiffness and looseness, stretch it with firm pressure, and hold your arm at an angle for some time.
When a joint is formed in that place, doctors remove the ligament of it and arrange it like this
If the joint is not too stiff, doctors put the splint and ligament together again, arranging them so that they are together for several days until it hardens
If the joint is unstable and mobility is reduced, doctors administer a humectant (a substance that holds water) and lubricant (subtle friction reducer), so that it becomes loose again; or to pause the joint from excessive motion with a splint, as may be necessary; and arrange it in such a way that it can move freely when needed. Then apply the splint on top of that, and when you put it back in place, doctors will gently rub or apply a lubricant to the joint again to make sure there is no excessive friction, ensuring free motion one by one. And if necessary, for example, as soon as the patient's condition improves
If you want to, pause over the wet and cold bandage covering it, and then put that on top of him; and in this way arrange things so that he is moistened but does not get too stiff.
The end of the medical treatise
When a dislocation occurs in one of the joints between the arm and hand, it can cause pain.
To reduce the dislocation of the arm, it is necessary to quickly reduce it at the time of displacement, or else risk having it reappear if left unattended with a band-aid applied immediately
To reduce the dislocation of the arm, you put the patient's hand on a table and have the surgeon extend their hand to that one, then place your own hand or palm over the imminent joint and press it into position so that it returns to its original location.
If the palm is already on the belly of the arm, then have the patient put their hand down flat on a table and reduce it; but if there has been an earlier dislocation you must place their hand in position within reach of the surgeon's hand so that they can press into its immediate location.
If you return here, good; if not, then stretch the arm and let go of that one; otherwise do nothing else until after this action has been completed.
The joint should be stretched as much as possible without causing the patient any pain; if there are no nerves to stretch or they are not flexible, then it is best to let them rest and have a cure applied gently at this time in case of an injury occurring
When the ailment returns, the healer will lie on top of it as recommended, and work with all their might for days; and afterwards, the limb should be straightened out and worked properly
If the movement of that limb occurs and is accompanied by severe weight loss or excessive swelling, then the healer will try to reduce it as much as possible.
The thirtieth chapter.
Of joint dislocation care.
When the swelling of that limb is so severe as to cause joint dislocation, then the healer will treat it in all its parts.
When one or more of the joints in that limb is dislocated at its top (the fingers) or inside it (belly), then the healer will bind up the joint and prevent its dislocation by supporting both extremities as mentioned above, until it returns to normal
The healer will hold onto the top of the joint and suspend that portion in which it is dislocated, and then apply it for two days.
They will hold that part as mentioned above until its condition improves on that same day.
If after that, you then describe the next situation and cease supporting it on that day and exercise its movement, and let it be in use for those days until it is straight.
If that is the case of dislocation in a finger or hand, and they do this procedure for each situation until it is healed.
When you are dislocated at other joints.
You have provided a very incomplete translation, but I can make some educated guesses based on the Latin and Spanish words used in your text. The phrase "e semblantment fay am aquo" could be translated as "in a similar manner to this." However, without context or more information, it is difficult to provide an accurate translation for the entire sentence.
This would mean "The care of dislocation from the spine".
If any of the spine or collarbone is dislocated and becomes fixed, and it cannot be restored to its place, then pain occurs in that part of the body, which can lead to death for the patient.
The thing to remember here is that the exit of the patient's bowels is against their will, and it cannot be retained; furthermore, massaging the affected members or legs can prevent the intestines from coming out through them, or pressing on one of those could press the spine back into place.
After that, it is said to be restored at the rear and is called "tailbone.
The care of it is that if the tailbone injury occurs due to a disease or illness, then neither its care nor its health as a whole can be managed.
If it is hit by hitting or striking or in any other way on those areas, then the ancient ways of care would be used which are very long and complex, from which may return to its profit; may you have already exhausted that for which little help was available through excessive use of it, due to our proximity to each other's exposure and because we have just explained this in a different way with an instrument like this.
"And for those who have pain in the chest area, there is nothing to be done but what I mentioned earlier.
"And the hernia is extended over her face towards the back of the head, and spread out to prevent the intestine from coming out.
"Place a cushion in front of her face near the back of her head, and another one on each foot next to her.
"The minister had the cushion but was not placed in a hole, and another minister had the other one in that way.
"Wrap the cushion around the patient's head and place them firmly on each side of their neck, and stretch those to the cushion that covers the back of your head as well, and arrange the others over the thighs and buttocks, holding them tightly.
"The minister stretched the cushion to reach out and not tighten them on both sides of their locations where they were placed, but still firmly.
The doctor places his hands on the patient's back, firm and strong, so that they return or place them flat on a table, ensuring the patients' feet stay down while it returns.
If this does not work, the doctor places a table where its length or width is three steps, and in the wall opposite to the patient there is a hole so that when you go through it from one end of the table to the other extremity The doctor places the mattress on the back and then the patient onto it, ensuring that they return to their original location.
If you wish to do so, open a hole in the mattress where it rotates around your arm; and if you lie down on the ground with your head towards the back of the bed, place one hand at each end of the mattress such that they are both flat on the floor.
And it is also important to note that when you open a hole in one side of the mattress and rotate around your arm as described above, ensure both holes are opened on each end of the mattress.
At one end of the mattress is a hole where it is shaped like your arm, its length being equal to that around which you rotate; and at the other two ends there are similar holes formed.
When you have stretched the linen that covers the chest of the patient and across the back where it should cover his head, tie them on both thighs to hold his legs, and tie them on her arms to keep his hands still.
You should put one hand around the patient's waist and hold it as if you were holding a pillow or cushion, while another doctor comes to check his spine after that was mentioned by the first doctor.
After the spine is returned in place and a doctor comes to examine it closely, then apply pressure gently on the affected area with a warm compress soaked in vinegar or other suitable substance for pain relief, and then stop applying it and cover the sore area as shown below:
After tying them on both thighs to hold his legs still, gently feed him nutritious food or a bland diet that is recommended by doctors for pain relief
If there is no immediate threat to his life during the healing process and doctors recommend administering medicines that alleviate pain and can be administered over time from a table as recommended by them, it should also include taking medication orally at that location.
Some vegetables may cause immediate pain in the back of the head and are recommended to be avoided because they can lead to severe complications if taken with this medicine, as it could prove fatal for you.
When a gout attack occurs in the feet
The dislocation or sprain has occurred.
The joints of the limbs and muscles are dislocated in only one place, not two places as occurs to smaller joints or cavities.
The joint of the ankle is dislocated in four different places: it occurs behind the foot or forward on the foot or to one side and then the other side or diagonally across from front to back.
Additionally, it is dislocated in the direction of the foot behind or forward on the foot but rarely at the side and diagonally across from front to back.
The dislocation of the joint at the back of the foot is four times when you adjust the cushion over the patient and the patient lies flat on their stomach; there will be pain as if the intestine had come out, and it's a sign that the hernia may not heal well enough or quickly.
The indication of when dislocation occurs in the direction away from the foot is that the accidents caused by this type of injury are contrary to those occurring elsewhere.
The indication of when dislocation occurs in the direction forward on the foot is that the cushion will expand twice more than usual pain, but it may not relieve all of this pain and if necessary you must go to the direction forward and cannot return to where dislocation occurred; urine is retained and pain increases and you must take the patient to a hospital.
When a dislocation occurs behind the leg it is not allowed to straighten or bend that limb back; instead one servant will hold the knee firmly and another by its calf, making sure the calf is very soft so as not to be able to touch the ground.
In the case of a chronic dislocation that has already occurred and is not very severe but still painful, you must consider it to be necessary for the doctor to administer treatment as soon as possible, unless they find something else to treat first; otherwise, do nothing about treating it.
If the dislocation is recent and one of the four types, you must have it examined to see if there are any fractures or dislocations in the joint itself or elsewhere, but do nothing else unless that examination shows another issue.
If not, you should prepare the patient's bed very comfortably and extend their legs out as far as possible, or onto a support like pillows; another servant may also stretch their arms towards them if they are able to do so without causing pain, but make sure that nothing touches their chest directly. And have another servant keep an eye on the joint area itself, ensuring it is not twisted in any way, and also ensure another servant extends both of their extremities as far as possible.
When pain occurs in the ribs or behind them?
It's when the patient lifts their leg to the knee, and they remain bent forward.
Yes, this special type of treatment is common in all four cases.
If the dislocation returns to where we've said it is good; otherwise, pain will be necessary for another special type of treatment.
In the reduction of its own, when it is dislocated and it is at the joints between the ribs on one side, where the patient leans their head so that they can see; and place another ligature over the area below the neck to prevent the intestine from coming out in front of them.
Then place a strong minister on the patient's chest and tighten it firmly to hold the large cavity of the patient open and extend both legs forcefully towards the front so that this returns into its own location.
This special treatment is more gentle than all the others for this member being reduced to these others.
I apologize for the late response and do not insist on entering into this special type of treatment with both feet firmly tied to a long board as well as around their arms.
When one part of a limb is measured by its length to four digits and the other's measurement extends further than two digits,
The hernia is suspended over its top and to the side of it. And the length of the earth is measured by two breasts.
The strong youth commands the top of the hernia to be suspended and also commands another youth to hold it down with force, so that the joint returns to its original place quickly.
When the dislocation occurs outside of the joint, he commands that the hernia be suspended with a second rope as recommended by the physician, and also tightens both ropes on the thigh of the patient.
He suspends two ropes to the back of him and one to his head; he suspends another rope between the thighs from where the dampening occurs, so that the hernia is not pulled in or out through these openings.
The minister extends his hand to him and the physician tightens it according to the art.
When the dislocation occurs on one of the lower limbs, doctors ask that the bed be elevated accordingly to prevent complications.
If the dislocation is on one of the upper limbs, doctors ask that the patient be elevated on their side to prevent complications.
Doctors administer compression therapy over the affected joint.
Once the reduction is complete, ensure that both legs are extended and apply pressure to the affected joint with the heel of one hand. Then gently press down on the other thigh as well. If you notice any excoriation or pain during this process, doctors recommend placing a cushion between your fingers while applying pressure to prevent injury.
Ensure that both legs are extended and press down on the affected joint with one hand.
Joints become inflamed when there is a blockage in circulation to them.
If no cause of pain relief is found, the physician will return and retest after three days.
And then apply this remedy, taking care to do it quickly before any blisters occur, until the pain is relieved and comfort is felt.
Chapter 32 of a book?
Treatment for joint inflammation.
Joint dislocation is corrected after three months at the front, back and below, but not in front of the belly button.
The treatment for dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his cushion on top of the thigh, and it will be corrected by him.
The restoration of all the fingers is to make the patient put his hands on top, and then extend his cushion if able; hold two fingers in front of him, place one finger between each thumb and pointer finger of his hand; and then apply his hand over the dislocation holding it firmly until it returns to its place.
The abdomen of the patient will be opened up, allowing the surgeon to see inside.
The servant is placed between the thighs of the patient and stays in place for three or four days depending on the situation, then removed.
The patient will be taken care of during their stay until they are healed and comfortable
If the reduction is excused, it means that the surgeon will provide extensive care during the recovery period from previous surgery.
The end of this text
And for the treatment and healing of the dislocation
The toes are bent and straightened once more, and the dislocation of it will be done by hand or with forceps.
It means that after the dislocation is made, the toes should straighten naturally to their previous position.
The treatment for straightening of the leg is by using a straightener device, and it should be used as easily as possible until it returns to its original position.
When a dislocation occurs for the second time after straightening it, you should make sure to pull gently on the patient's arm behind them and keep applying force until the leg returns into place.
The first sentence translates to "Here you place your right hand on the lower part of the thigh and left hand on the upper part of the foot in the hollow below.
The sentence is describing the correct positioning for performing a cautery procedure on the foot. Here's how it translates: "Place your right hand in front of your left hand, and put both hands over the hollow below to support them.
The sentence implies that this is just a step taken after performing other procedures or actions related to the patient's condition.
This final sentence suggests that once you have performed the cautery procedure on one part of the foot (the lower part), proceed to perform it on the other part (upper part).
This sentence implies that if the procedure is performed in one or two steps as described earlier and you successfully perform both procedures then everything will be fine. However, if things go wrong during either of them, doctors should intervene to correct this issue.
This sentence means that if the recommended reduction method is prohibited and doctors should proceed as follows: lay the patient on their back with a pillow placed firmly on the ground between their thighs, cover them completely with a blanket to prevent the hernia from slipping out of place.
The sentence suggests that after placing the patient on their back with the pillow placed below them between their thighs and covering them completely with a blanket to prevent the hernia from slipping out of place, another servant should extend one hand onto their waist or side while keeping the other hand extended against the chest as it is held by the first servant. This ensures that nothing protrudes outside so everything remains contained within the cavity below.
When the doctor makes an incision on your breast or leg, another attendant should hold the healthy shoulder to prevent it from moving around, and another minister should have the cushion in place at all joints of theirs, so that the dislocation returns easily.
When the dislocation is returned and declared as healed by your doctor, you should remove the splint and stretch that area gently but firmly, and bind it up with tape on the leg above.
You should take care of any nerves that are behind your heel to prevent them from tightening and causing harm to it.
Leave it in place for two or three days if the bandage is loose enough, and if it loosens up you should remove it.
Remove it on the third day at the latest, or preferably on the fourth, but do not let your patient go without it for more than four days. If you want to take it off before the wound has healed and been cured completely, do not be afraid that the dislocation will remain open or infected, but rather prepare for care.
If the pointed cautery is used at this stage in healing or anointing, be sure that it precedes our account and goes into other parts of care and anointing until it has healed completely.
Conclusion.
Treatment for foot dislocations.
When someone's dislocated joint causes very little pain, then it is easy to move around.
If the dislocation is on one of your feet, then stretch it gently towards a flat surface or table, being careful not to twist it as you would do otherwise.
When you are on your stomach and place your foot over the area of the joints, stretch it gently towards a point where it will be straight if straightened out, then return to its original position without making any sound or noise.
When you place your foot on a table with two legs and stretch it gently for three days, then stop stretching when the pain is gone or reduced to the extent that movement becomes difficult, but ensure rest of three days before resuming activity again.
Chapter 55
Among the types of dislocations are those that occur in sprains or fractures, as well as any other kind.
When a cause of those dislocations occurs and you are unable to treat it or restore its function, that is what leads to death.
Therefore, instead of focusing on the healing process itself, it is better to treat the cause and use medicines that give hope only for recovery from disease or injury, rather than giving a cure for death itself, which does not appear possible; with all its consequences When you have cut through the flesh of a patient so that the cause is evident from the beginning, then do not hesitate to use the cautery.
After removing that member and you want to apply the treatment, then provide the cautery as well as cure for the pain in that area caused by the dry blisters
If dislocation is the fracture and occurs in separate parts of the body, then apply a statement as well to prevent it from spreading further, and make sure you've already done so in the preceding areas.
Save and avoid second the use of that which is forbidden in the ways of terror lest you may be preceded by my warning; for what I say here is most important to you so that it may last forever, and may greet your body on this day as well as all those after. And these phrases of Albulcasis are properly translated to the extent that God will be pleased with them. Amen
