Chapter fifty-one on the excision of warts that appear on the abdomen
Warts, called fungal warts due to their resemblance to fungi, frequently appear on some people's stomachs and other parts of their bodies. Their base is thin, and their head is thick, with inverted lips. Some are small, while others become very large.
I have indeed seen a man with two warts on his stomach, resembling fungi exactly, white, with a thin base and inverted, cracked lips, constantly oozing moisture.
I cut them off, and I estimated the weight of one to be about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces.
The procedure for removing them is to examine the patient; if the patient is of a moist constitution and the wart's color is white, moist, and thin-based, then cut it with a wide scalpel, keeping cauterizing irons at hand in the fire, as often profuse bleeding occurs when cutting them, so be prompt. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it.
If you find the patient is cowardly and fears cutting with iron, take a tightly twisted lead thread and tie it around the wart with these characteristics. Leave it for two days, then tighten the lead. Continue tightening the lead whenever it affects the wart, until it cuts off and falls by itself without any effort.
If the wart is thick-based, cutting it involves some risk and danger, especially those located on the stomach. However, it is possible to cut off half or part of it and then cauterize it to prevent its recurrence.
Then treat it until the wound heals.
Beware of cutting a wart that is dark in color, has little sensation, and has an unpleasant appearance, as it is a cancerous tumor, and we will discuss cancer after this.
