of the movement of teeth
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and it is of no use, then place the patient's head in your lap;
afterwards, heat the cautery, the shape of which will come later, in such a way that you place a small chain on the tooth;
and place the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand there so that the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterwards, remove your hand and reapply the cautery as you wish;
afterwards, have the patient fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and then spit it out.
And in this way the tooth that was loose is strengthened, and the softened gums are tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
