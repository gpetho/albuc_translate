of bladder diseases
When abrasions or blood appear in the bladder, or pus has collected there, and you want to instill waters and medicines, do it with the instrument called a "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and it has three holes: two on one side, and one on the other, as you can see; and the capped place through which the medicine flows should be such that it tightly stops the penis without further additions, so that one can draw out the moisture, and insert it when necessary; and when you want to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the end of the catheter in the liquid, and pull on the plunger that is inside; you will draw the liquid into the catheter, and then push the plunger back in firmly; the liquid will enter and go into the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it; and this is the form of the thin clyster with which one irrigates the bladder: here it is:
And it is made of silver or bronze, and the top is higher; and below it has a breast where the binding falls; then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you want to irrigate the bladder, then tie it tightly between the two breasts with a good double thread, and warm that liquid a little over the fire; then insert the end of the clyster into the penis, then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid evenly, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder; and if you don't have the bladder, take a piece of parchment, and make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around; then put a strong thread through these holes, then gather the circle as one gathers a bag, and put inside what you want of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument; and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
