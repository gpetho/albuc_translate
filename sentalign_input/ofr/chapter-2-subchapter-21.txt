of the breaking of the uvea
When a disruption occurs in the uvea, then it opens, and matter comes out of the eyelids like a grain of resin, and it is frightening to see;
then if you see fit to cut it, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the part underneath, up to the one above, then insert another needle with a double thread from the corner of the eye;
and pierce it there, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie one part of the uvea around it, and tighten it well, then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye;
and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is held together by the uvea, all around, with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye swells considerably, pierce it at the thin spot that comes from deep within the eye, and drain the albuginous moisture so the eye goes down, and enter it immediately;
then remove it once it is healed.
