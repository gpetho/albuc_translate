Of the womb/uterus
When the womb is cold and moist, and yet does not fail to conceive, and the menses are corrupted and their periods delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary to make three cauteries around the vulva, as we have said for the cauterization of the bladder, and two cauteries on the outside of the back; and let the cautery be key-shaped, as we have said.
