This vein is generated in legs, in hot regions where neither grass nor trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture; and sometimes it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens because of the putrefaction that comes under the skin, just as snakes and worms, generated between skin and flesh, occur within the body.	This kind of vein occurs in the leg in hot countries such as the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs and in hot arid infertile countries. It also often occurs in other parts of the body beside the legs. The origin of it is a corruption taking place beneath the skin in the same way that round-worms and worms and gourd-worms arise in the inward parts of the body; also the worms that are generated between the skin and the flesh.	0.72962505
And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a very large inflammation appears in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to protrude, like the root of a plant.	The sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is a violent inflammation in the leg; then the place swells up and blisters; then the vein begins to extrude at the blistered place as if it were a plant-stem or an animal.	0.77756834
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it appears in the ankle joint, or in the foot, and many holes appear there, from which branches sprout; then treat it as we have said before.	Sometimes also this vein is found branching, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself; and in this case there are many openings and a branch comes out of each. The treatment is as mentioned above in the section.	0.8697101
