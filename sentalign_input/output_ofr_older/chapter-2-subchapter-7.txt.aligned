About the blockage of the ears	On the treatment of obstructions in the ear.	0.6814078
Some children are born who have no openings in their ears; and this same thing happens to men by blockage from a wound, or flesh growing inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes occurs deep inside the ear, so it cannot be seen; and sometimes it happens a little outside the hole, and it can be easily seen.	Infants sometimes are born with an imperforated auditory meatus. Some people also get an obstruction in the passage of the ear, either from an injury or from flesh growing in it. Sometimes this obstruction is at the bottom of the ear out of sight, but sometimes it occurs a little outside the passage and is invisible.	0.86774623
So that which occurs deep inside, if it cannot be seen, is of difficult healing in many cases, and in that which can be seen, you must place the ear of the patient in the sun; and look inside: if you see the blockage apparent, then work it with this spatula of which this is the form:	The sort which occurs in the depths of the ear and is invisible is, in general, difficult to cure. As for that which is within sight, set the patient's ear in the sun and examine it; and if you see that the object is something external you should make an opening with a fine scalpel like this.	0.83732164
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and back, so that it does not injure the ear; if the blockage is of grown flesh or body of the ear, then hold it with delicate pincers, and cut it lightly, until that flesh is all removed.	Let its extremity be slightly broad, with a sharp point; while the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear. But if the obstruction be from flesh growing in the auditory meatus, catch it with a fine hook and cut it, with the utmost gentleness, till all the flesh is gone.	0.7856732
And if the blockage is deep in the ear, then take a light, delicate razor and heat it a little in the fire, then place it in the body of the ear. If you feel the blockage where the patient feels discomfort in hearing, pierce lightly, and make sure you do not injure the nerves of the ear; then place a tent in the ear according to the width of the hole, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment.	If the obstruction be in the depth of the ear, take a fine smooth probe and warm it a little in the fire; then push it into the meatus. If you feel the obstruction (what time the patient will experience hardness of hearing), seek to perforate it gently, being careful not to injure the nerve of the ear. Then put in a plug the width of the meatus, which you will have anointed with Egyptian ointment; do this for some days till you are sure that the wound is healing.	0.86525154
Do this for some days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it with rose water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it; and if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and place another tent moistened with wax made from rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; then treat it until it is healed.	Then put in a plug the width of the meatus, which you will have anointed with Egyptian ointment; do this for some days till you are sure that the wound is healing. Or take a plug and dip it into water and sprinkle it with powdered vitriol and use that. If you perceive the ear swelling with an abscess you should remove the plug and put in its place another previously prepared by soaking in wax made with oil of roses, till the abscess has subsided; then dress till it is healed.	0.8614565
And if bleeding occurs, then plunge a sponge and cloths into cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop bleeding which are in the treatment of distillations.	If a haemorrhage occur, dip a sponge or piece of material in cold water and put it on the ear, and apply the rest of the treatment to stop haemorrhage mentioned in the treatise on instillations.	0.82194126
