"Axirnath" is a type of fat that develops in the membranes of the upper eyelid. It often occurs in children, weighing on their eyes, causing morning discharge, making them unable to look at sunlight, and inducing tears to flow, due to which they frequently lie on their faces and sleep on them. Their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, covered by swelling, and the swelling of the Axirnath is visible, and when you press on the area with your fingers, you can feel the Axirnath between them.	Hydatid is fat which arises in the folds of the upper lid. It is a disease chiefly occurring in children, irritating their eyes, giving them morning catarrh; they are unable to look full into the light of the sun, since they get an immediate secretion of tears. And for that reason you will find them lying always on their faces, and they also sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below the eyebrows are moist and covered with swellings, while the hydatid stands out prominently; and when you press upon the place with your finger you can feel the fat beneath it.	0.76243174
The procedure is for the patient to place their head in your lap.	The manner of operating is for the patient to let his head rest in your lap.	0.860929
Then take a linen cloth, prepare a small bandage in it, and make a ring from this bandage according to the size that covers the Axirnath on all sides. Place it over the area, and press with your fingers from all sides so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the ring.	Then you take a scrap of linen and prepare a pad of it. Make it into a circle of sufficient size to enclose the whole of the hydatid on all sides, then place it on it and squeeze with your fingers on all sides, so as to gather up the hydatid in the centre of the circle.	0.8462512
Then make a shallow cut across the middle of that moist area with a spatula, creating small incisions horizontally, no deeper than a vein incision.	Then in the middle of this humidity make a crosswise incision with a lancet, but do not let the incision be larger than that made for a venesection.	0.6651082
Or you may need to cut through the entire skin until you reach the Axirnath, as in many cases, the Axirnath will come out from the incision in the form of a piece of white fat.	As to the depth, the skin should be incised right through till you come to the hydatid, which in most cases will come out from the incision, in the shape of a white piece of fat.	0.58762825
Then extract it with a cloth, which you hold between your fingers toward the outside; turn your hand to the right and left until it comes loose; and be careful not to deepen the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the spatula and injure it.	Draw it out with a cloth rolled between your fingers, turning your hand to right and to left till it is separated. Be careful not to go so deep with your scalpel that it sticks in the eye and injures it.	0.8679606
If the Axirnath does not appear at the start of the incision, slightly deepen the incision gently until the Axirnath emerges. Then extract it as we have described.	If you do not see the hydatid at the first incision, you must gently cut a little deeper till it comes forth, then draw it out as described.	0.738123
Then soak cloths in vinegar and water, place them over the area, and bind it with compresses.	Then dip some cloth in vinegar and water, apply to the place and bind it up with pads.	0.8765892
Some people grind salt and place it in the hollow of the incision, so that any remaining moisture is dissolved.	There are some who grind up salt and put it in the hollow of the incision to liquefy thereby the remains of the humidity.	0.8901688
Then treat it until it heals.	Then dress till healed.	0.7971039
If a warm abscess forms in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.	If an effusion occur in the place, treat with sedative plasters till healed.	0.8026153
