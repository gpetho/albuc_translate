These little growths that appear on the eyelids when they are moist and dry must be pulled out with forceps and tweezers, and the root cut with a small spatula; 
then apply ground vitriol to the area.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a fine lenticular cautery, and cauterizing after the incision is worth a lot;
and they often return, when some of their roots remain;
and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and they do not return.
