Chapter seventy-eight on expelling the placenta
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with pellitory, and tightly cover her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out with this, fine; otherwise, take a pot and pierce a hole in its lid. Place in it herbs that open the cervix, such as rue, oregano, dill, chamomile, wormwood, savin, and centaury. Use all these medicines or some of them, submerge them in water, and put the pot on the fire. Then place a silver tube over the hole in the pot's lid, with the other end in the cervix, and hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus. Then make her sneeze as we said, and the placenta will come out quickly.
If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in rose oil or marshmallow extract, then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta. If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it gently, little by little, until it comes out.
If it is adhered deep in the uterus, insert the hand as we described until you find the placenta. Then pull it gently, little by little, taking care lest the uterus prolapses with strong pulling. Rather, it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then increase the pulling force; it will then respond and detach from the adhesion.
If the cervix is closed, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, beware of being rough with her in pulling again. But you should tie what has come out of it, at the cervix, to the woman's thigh, then inject her with the quadruple ointment. It will rot it after a few days, and it will dissolve and come out. However, if it rots, a foul odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, and this will harm the patient. So, it is necessary to use suitable fumigation for this, and some of the ancients have tried fumigation with garden cress and dried figs.
Picture of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated in case of retention of menses, placenta, and the like:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel.
Or it is made of copper.
The thin end is placed in the vagina.
And the wide end over the fire.
And the incense is placed on the coals.
You hold it until that incense is gone.
And you replace it with another.
