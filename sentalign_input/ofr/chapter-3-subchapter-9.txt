of the fracture of the neck
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and rarely does it bend;
and also in the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, take note if you see their hands softened and swollen and dead, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it.
Know that he is mortally [injured] in many cases, and if he moves them and feels well when they are squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is saved, and that the patient will be cured, if care is applied.
And if a similar thing occurs in the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, note if the feet are softened, and if the same symptoms are there as in the hands, and on the back jumping flatulence and involuntary defecation;
and when he is turned on his stomach, involuntary defecation occurs.
And when he is turned on his back and he wants to sit up, he cannot.
Know that he is mortally wounded:
so do not work on his treatment.
And if this accident does not happen to him, then the matter is less serious.
And the treatment is that you look to see if there is a hot abscess, then put on the spine rose oil or oil of egg yolks, until it is soothed;
then apply one of the strengthening and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and tell the patient to rest;
and not to sleep on the side where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, then it is necessary to cut to the heart; 
and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "tail head," then place the ball of your left hand there and align it with your other hand as best you can, then apply the plaster and splint, if you need it;
then bind it, and if there is a separated bone, then cut open, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
