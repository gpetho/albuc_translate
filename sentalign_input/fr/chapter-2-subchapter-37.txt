Of the uvula
When phlegm descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular"; and if it is swollen and round below, it is called "uvula". When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment is not effective, and you see that the hot abscess is calm, and it is thin, you must cut it; and the one that is round and not long; and if it is blood-red or dark in color, you must avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient. It is necessary then, when you see it, according to the way I have described, its whiteness and length, that you make the patient sit in front of the sun, and press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned earlier; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils. And you must only cut the excess that is beyond the natural limit; for if you cut more, it will harm the voice, and speech; and after the cutting, use what we have said in the cutting of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed. And if the patient is afraid of cutting, you must use a device to cauterize it without fear. And the manner of cauterizing is with a sharp instrument. And it is that the patient places his head in your lap, and then you press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and fill it with quicklime water, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and fill the end of this instrument with it, which has this form:
And it should have a hair-like tip where the medicine is placed, like the tip of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula; and the patient should lie on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run from his mouth away from the medicine, so that it does not descend into the throat and cause harm; then hold the instrument with the medicine and press it on the uvula for about half an hour, until you see it blacken and the burning of the medicine is eased; and if you want, take cotton and wrap it on an instrument, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and place the instrument with the cotton on the uvula, so that the cotton sticks to the uvula; and do this often, until the cauterization is complete, then let it dry, and it will fall off after four or five days. And if you need to repeat the cauterization with the medicine, do so, and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and clean the area of the medicine; and rinse with cold water, and treat with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than cutting or cautery; if it is treated with fumigation in this manner, take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, chamomile, oats, and similar herbs, and combine all or some of them in a pot, and add plantain, and boil them; and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and in the middle of the pot have an instrument with this tip:
And it should be made of silver or fine bronze, and one end should be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is mortified; then repeat this often, until the uvula dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the hot abscess, as many things can happen; and only do this when the hot abscess is in decline. And if this instrument is not available, take a tube and place an eggshell at the end, so that the patient's mouth does not get too hot; for the eggshell prevents the vapor from harming the mouth, and it is a good and safe treatment.
