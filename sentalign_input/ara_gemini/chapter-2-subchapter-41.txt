Chapter forty-one on incising the tumors that occur on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp.
And they are of the types of sal'a (wens/cysts), contained in membranes that have sacs like the crop of a chicken.
And its types are many, some of them are fatty.
And some of them contain moisture resembling mire/sediment.
And some of them contain moisture resembling pus and broth and the like.
And some of them are petrified and hard.
And there is no danger in incising them and extracting their contents, unless an artery obstructs you when you incise it.
The procedure for incising it is to first probe it with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called al-Midass (the probe), so that you know what it contains.
So if what it contains is moisture, incise it lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:
And begin the incision from line B to line C.
Once the fluid has emptied, peel off the sac that contained that fluid and cut it all out, leaving nothing of it at all, for it often returns if anything of it remains.
Then dip cotton in the Egyptian ointment if it is available, and if not, in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, as it will consume what remains of the sac.
Then repeat the application of the cotton with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time, if needed, until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains.
Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals.
And if the swelling contains a fatty mass, incise it in this manner.
Make a cruciform incision and insert the hooks into the lips of the wound and peel it from every side.
And exert your utmost effort in extracting the membrane that contains it.
If an artery obstructs you, do what I described to you later, and do the same for the swelling if it is hardened from the incision, and the treatment is the same as I mentioned.
The incision on the hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture, and some of these swellings that are in the head in some people may have no moisture at all, and that is because I incised a swelling in the head of an old woman, and I found the swelling like a hard, rough, white stone, I could not break it, and if someone threw it, it would injure him.
And what was of the other swellings occurring in the head other than this, such as the swellings that appear in the heads of children and at the bases of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision and make its bottom from its lower part to facilitate the flow of the material to the bottom, then treat it with what is appropriate for it of treatment.
