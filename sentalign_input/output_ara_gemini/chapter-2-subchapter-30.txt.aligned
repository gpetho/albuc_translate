Chapter Thirty on the Extraction of Teeth	CHAPTER THIRTY. On the extraction of teeth.	0.73089767
It is appropriate to treat the tooth for its pain with every possible remedy and to be hesitant about extracting it, for there is no replacement for it if it is extracted, because it is a noble substance, even if there is no alternative but to extract it.	You should treat toothache with every device and be reluctant to extract; nothing can replace the tooth when it is extracted, for it is a noble substance—until there is no means of avoiding extraction.	0.8146853
So it is appropriate, if the ailing person is determined to extract it, that you ascertain and verify that the aching tooth is indeed the one, for often the pain deceives the ailing person, and he thinks that it is in the healthy tooth, so he extracts it, and then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.	When the patient is determined to have it out, act with deliberation till you are sure which is the painful tooth; for often the pain deceives the patient and he thinks the pain is in a tooth that is sound, so he has that one extracted; but the pain does not abate until the diseased tooth is removed.	0.8208604
We have seen this from the actions of cuppers repeatedly.	We have frequently seen this happen in the practice of the barber-surgeons.	0.6934836
So if you are certain about the aching tooth itself, then it is appropriate to incise around the tooth with a lancet that has some strength, until you loosen the gum from every side, then move it with your fingers or with the gentle forceps first, little by little, until you loosen it, then at that point secure it firmly with the large forceps while the ailing person's head is between your knees, firmly held so he doesn't move, then pull the tooth straight so you don't break it.	When you are quite sure which is actually the painful tooth you should cut away all round the tooth with a scalpel having a certain measure of strength, until the gum is separated all round. Then, with your fingers, or with a pair of fine forceps, first move the tooth slowly and gently till you stir it; then get a good grip on it with a pair of large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees so that it does not move. Then draw the tooth straight out so as not to splinter it.	0.8728232
If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from every direction gently, and keep moving it as you did before.	And if it will not come out, then take one of these following instruments and gradually introduce it beneath the tooth all round; then try to move it as you did before.	0.8445078
And if the tooth is perforated or corroded, it is appropriate to fill that hole with a piece of cloth and plug it well with the tip of a thin file so that it does not shatter when you pull on it with the forceps, and it is appropriate to be thorough in incising around the gum from every side carefully, and be careful with your effort so you don’t break it, and some of it remains, causing the ailing person a calamity greater than his first pain.	If the tooth has a hole in it or is decayed, you should plug the hole with a rag, forcing it in with the tip of a fine probe so that it will not break when you grip it with the forceps. You must completely scarify all round the gum. Take the utmost care not to splinter the tooth lest a piece should remain behind and arouse the patient's ills afresh, causing greater pain than before.	0.83923835
And beware of doing what the ignorant cuppers do in their haste and rushing into extracting it without using what we described, for they often inflict great calamities upon people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or some of its roots remain. Or that they extract it with some of the jawbone as we have witnessed repeatedly.	Take care not to do those things that the ignorant barber-surgeons do in their rashness and haste in dental extraction, neglecting to employ the methods we describe. For they often bring great troubles upon people, the least of which is to break the tooth off short, leaving the whole or part of the root behind; or to remove the tooth together with a piece of the jaw bone, as I have often seen.	0.8402089
Then after extracting it, he should rinse his mouth with wine or with vinegar and salt.	Then after the extraction let the patient rinse with wine or vinegar and salt.	0.8571633
If bleeding occurs from the area, and this often happens, then crush some vitriol and pack the area with it, or otherwise cauterize it if the vitriol does not benefit you.	If there occur haemorrhage from the place—a common occurrence—then pound up a little vitriol and stuff the place with it. If the vitriol does not avail, cauterize.	0.80008864
The shape of the gentle forceps with which you move the tooth first should be long-tipped, short-handled, and thick so that they do not bend when you grip the tooth with them.	The shape of the fine forceps with which you first move the tooth should be with long jaws and a short handle, thick, lest they bend when you take hold of the tooth.	0.9547717
And this is the shape of the large forceps:	And this is the shape of the large forceps.	0.8867054
It should be, as you see, thick in the handles so that when gripped it does not give way or bend, and short in the extremities.	As you see, they have thick handles so that when you apply pressure with them they do not give or bend; and short jaws.	0.7062551
And let it be made of Indian iron or of well-wrought, polished steel at the extremities. And at its end are teeth that interlock with one another, so it grips firmly and tightly.	They should be of Indian iron or of steel, strongly made, the jaws tempered and having teeth fitting into each other so that a sure and firm grip may be obtained.	0.74392813
And the extremities may be made in the form of a file, and it will also be strong in gripping.	Sometimes the jaws are made like a file, also to give a strong grip.	0.60915667
