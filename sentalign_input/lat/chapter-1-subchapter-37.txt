On the Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys
Chapter 39.
When kidney pain arises due to cold or thickened wind (gas), and this reduces the patientâ€™s virility, it is necessary to cauterize over the kidneys on the area called the almethen. Apply a nail-shaped cautery to each kidney, as previously described.
You may also cauterize again on the lower back (almeidatu).
Thus, three linear cauterizations will be done.
This will provide the best therapeutic outcome.
