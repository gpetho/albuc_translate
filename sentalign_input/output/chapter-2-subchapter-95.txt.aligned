Of phlebotomy of the veins.	On venesection.	0.42084005
The veins for phlebotomy from which the usual places to perform it are as follows: two pulsating veins near the ears, called alhasisain; two veins in the temples; two veins in the tear ducts of the eyes called aspicientz; a vein in the middle of the forehead; a vein at the tip of the nose; two veins at the neck; two veins in the upper lip; two veins in the lower lip; — these are the veins called algelic —; and two veins under the tongue. But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five: One of these is the cephalic vein, which is on the outer side; and people call it "the head vein," also known as the middle vein, composed of a branch of the basilic vein and another branch of the cephalic vein; people call this "the vein of the whole body," and the basilic vein is on the inner side, known as “citillar,” called by common people "the vein of the belly"; the funis of the arm, located over the elbow, is the one where phlebotomy is performed, appearing over the pulse by clear manifestation; and salvatella, which is the vein between the ring finger and the little finger, located in two branches.	There are sixteen of them in the head, and they are: two pulsating vessels behind the ears that are called the two occipitals; the two external arteries in the temples; and the two veins in the two internal angles of the eyes, called the vessels of sight; and the vein running up the middle of the forehead; and the vein situated at the tip of the nose; and the two jugular veins in the neck; and the two veins in the upper lip and the two in the lower lip; these being the veins known as 'the four vessels'; and two veins beneath the tongue. As for the veins that are bled in the arm and hand, they are five. One is the cephalic, which is on the outer side; popularly they call it the 'headvein'; then there is the 'blue-black', that is, the median vein, which is made up of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic; popularly they call that the 'body-vein'; then the basilic vein; this is the one situated on the inner side and is termed also the axillary vein, but popularly it is called the 'belly-vein'; and then the cord of the arm; this is situated over the radius and is the one that is contiguous to it; this is the one that is clearly visible on the thumb. And the salvatella which is the vein between the little and ring fingers; it has two branches.	0.92303455
In the foot and leg, there are three veins; one is under the curve of the knee on the outer side; the second is the saphenous vein, located under the leg on the inner side; and the sciatic vein, located under the leg on the outer side; in the leg, there are other veins similar to these.	There are also three veins in the leg and foot; one of these is the sciatic vein on the outer aspect; the second is the saphena situated near the heel on the inner aspect; and there is the external saphena situated near the heel on the outer aspect. And there are three veins, counterparts to these, in the other leg.	0.9541056
The benefit of the veins near the ears is for old catarrhs and migraines and scurf and old head ulcers.	Venesection of the two veins behind the ears. Bleeding from both of these will give relief in cases of chronic catarrh, migraine and chronic foul pustules, and scabs of the head.	0.61281943
The method of bleeding these veins is as I tell you: shave the head of the patient, and rub the back of the patient's head where both veins are with a large cloth with good friction; then tighten the patient's neck with a band until the two veins and their places appear near the ears at two pressed places on the head; and find them with your finger, and if you feel their pulse with your finger, mark the spot with a probe.	The method of venesecting these two is as I shall now describe: the patient's head should be shaved and the hinder part, in the region of the two veins, should be strongly chafed with a rough cloth; then the patient should bind his neck with his turban until the two veins are visible; their position is behind the ears in the two flattened places of the head; feel for them with your finger and when you feel their pulsation beneath your finger then mark the place with ink.	0.90643
Then take the lancet knife, which is for incision, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the phlebotomy reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and the skin upwards and incise the vein with an incision knife. And let the length of the incision be the width of two fingers joined or around that; and let as much blood flow out as you want.	Then take a knife-scalpel, known as a lancet, and insert it beneath the vessel into the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone; then lifting with your hand both vessel and skin make an incision dividing both skin and vein; the length of the incision should be about two fingers side by side; then draw off the quantity of blood you wish.	0.89022845
Then press it with powders and leave it until it is healed.	Then bind them up with dressings and leave it until healed.	0.80366397
And it is already mentioned at the beginning of the book the incision of these and their cauterization.	The incision and cauterization of these two vessels has been discussed earlier in the book.	0.7306389
But for the two arterial veins in the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for chronic and severe migraines, persistent ophthalmia, and acute excessive discharges from the eyes.	The section of the two arteries in the temples gives relief for chronic migraine and severe headache and constant ophthalmia and the flow of acrid superfluities into the eyes.	0.6744057
And the method to phlebotomize them is as I tell you: have the patient tighten their neck greatly until the two veins appear by sensation through clear manifestation and their pulse is felt under your finger; then mark with a probe.	Now the manner of incising them is as I shall describe: the patient should bind his neck with a sash until the vessels stand out clearly to the eye and their pulsation is manifest under your finger; then mark with ink.	0.81708264
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, insert the incision phlebotomy tool underneath, lift the vein upwards; and incise it as you did with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to the amount you need.	Then with your forefinger raise the skin over the vessel and introduce a lancet beneath and lift up the vein and divide it as you did the other two; and draw off as much blood as you need.	0.8495752
Then loosen the patient's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then place cotton and powders on it and press it tightly, and leave it until it is healed.	Then loosen the band round the patient's neck and put your finger on the vein for a while; then apply cotton wool and a pad, bandage securely, and leave until it heals.	0.84615636
And the remembrance of them, and their incision, and the extraction is already mentioned at the beginning of the book.	They and their incision and extraction have been mentioned earlier in the book.	0.8142482
And thus the benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for chronic facial diseases and migraines and redness and foul ulcers.	Venesection of the vein in the forehead is, after venesection of the cephalic, a relief to chronic diseases of the face such as pustules and scabs and erysipelas.	0.60065305
And the method of phlebotomy there is as I tell you; that is, the patient tightens their neck with a band until the vein appears; then take the instrument called fossori of which this is its form:	Now I shall relate to you the method of cutting: you bind the patient's neck until the vessel stands out; then you take the instrument called the 'pickaxe'.	0.66787744
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the fossori on that vein and strike it with a hammer or other object in that manner, and let the blood flow as much as you want; then loosen the patient's constriction and press it until it is healed.	The spike in the head of the instrument you place on the vessel itself and then strike with a comb or some similar thing; and let the blood flow to the extent you wish; then loosen the band round the neck and bandage the vein until healed.	0.83021533
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotomy tool, but the phlebotomy tool should not be of sharp extremity like the other phlebotomy tools, rather it should be of wide extremity, and phlebotomize it transversely, because the bone is close and it would easily break the phlebotomy tool if it is fine.	Sometimes it is opened with a broad scalpel; the scalpel, however, should not have a sharp point like other scalpels but should be a little broader at the tip, and the vein is cut obliquely, because the bone is close and the scalpel, if it is too fine, may be broken on it.	0.71462107
But the benefit of the two veins in the tear ducts of both eyes is for scab in the eyes, redness, and inflammation in the eyes, and facial diseases.	Venesection of the two lachrymal veins gives relief in diseases of the eyes such as granular conjunctiva and inflammation and pannus, and in diseases of the face.	0.64289784
And the method of phlebotomy is that the patient tightens their neck with a band, then phlebotomize those, and you stand over the patient's head.	Now this is the method of incising: the patient binds a sash round his throat, then you cut open both veins, standing in front of him.	0.5280635
And perform the phlebotomy transversely a little with a small phlebotomy tool, because there is no flesh in that area; and if the phlebotomy tool is fine, its extremity will break easily.	The incision should be oblique, slightly longitudinal, with a small, rather broad scalpel, for in this place there is no flesh; so if the knife have too narrow a point it may be broken on the bone.	0.5916697
And then let the blood flow as much as you need, place cotton on them, and press them for one night, and then loosen them.	Then let flow what blood you wish, put cotton wool on both, tie for one night, then loosen.	0.8310405
But the phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and sudden severe fever, facial diseases, migraines, and redness that occur on the face, especially when chronic.	Venesection of the vein of the nose helps in acute fevers, in violent headache, and in diseases of the face such as the red pustules that arise on the nose, especially if they are chronic.	0.5677949
And the method of phlebotomy there is that the patient tightens their neck and you hold their nose with your left hand, take the fine long phlebotomy tool and insert it in the middle of the nose tip straightly, because the vein does not appear by sensation there, and because the blood starts to flow immediately.	This is how you make the incision: the patient binds his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a long fine scalpel and stick it in the middle of the very lobule of the nose, perpendicularly in the nasal septum (for the vein is not obvious at that spot) and blood will immediately flow out.	0.6960286
You should gradually withdraw your hand with the phlebotomy tool and let the blood flow according to your need; then bind it for one night, because it heals quickly.	You should advance the scalpel a little and cause the blood to flow as required; then bandage for one night, for it will quickly heal.	0.74910057
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the two guidegui veins is for nasal constriction, the onset of leprosy, many diseases, impetigo, and corrosive ulcers like herpes.	Venesection of the jugular veins helps tightness of breath and the early stage of elephantiasis, and the melancholic diseases arising on the surface of the skin, such as the black vitiligo and impetigo and malignant ulcers and cancrum oris.	0.4995005
And the method of phlebotomy for those is that the patient tightens below each vein in their neck with a band; the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should sit on a chair.	Now the way to venesect them is for the patient to bind his neck below them both with a band; let the operator stand behind the patient and let the patient be seated upon a chair.	0.7524576
Then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide phlebotomy tool little by little; then extract blood in a moderate amount or according to what is necessary for that; then do the same with the other vein.	Then incise the vein longitudinally with a rather wide opening; then let a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you think necessary; then do the same with the other vein.	0.8579026
Then loosen the band and press the two veins with moderate pressure so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until the morning because the wound is healed.	Then loosen the band and tie the veins with a moderate pressure lest the patient be suffocated; leave him until the next day and the wound will be healed.	0.8785367
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the algelic veins is for small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, gum decay, bad ulcers, and fissures, and bad ulcers in the nose and its surrounding area.	The four veins of the lips: venesection of them is effective, second to section of the cephalic vein, for pustules on the mouth and rotting of the gums and malignant ulcers and fissures of the lips and for malignant ulcer in the nose and round about.	0.5758844
And the method of phlebotomy for those is that you make the patient sit in front of you, tighten their neck with a band, then turn their lips and look at the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left side; and the identification of each is by the blackness of each of both, and more so because around them are small black veins; then incise each with an incision tool.	The way to venesect is to seat the patient in front of you and bind a sash round his neck, then roll back his lips and look for the two veins, one of which you will see to the left and the other to the right; their dark colour will show them up against the lip and also the fact that round them are fine dark veins; so cut down upon both, dividing them.	0.79816514
But if you have doubt, and do not know which one it is, then you should proceed to incise the largest of those, and the most apparent of those.	But if you are in doubt about the matter and are not sure what they are, set about incising the largest and most obvious.	0.8714875
And do the same with the two veins in the upper lips.	Do the same with the two veins in the upper lip.	0.93298995
But the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins under the tongue is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for inflammations in the throat, diseases of the uvula, and mouth diseases.	The two veins under the tongue: their venesection is, after section of the cephalic, of good effect in the quinsy arising in the throat from disease of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.	0.6313795
And the method of phlebotomizing those is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look under the tongue, from one side to the other, and the color of each is leaning towards blackness.	The way to venesect them is to seat the patient before you in the sunlight and raise his tongue, and look, and you will see beneath the tongue one vein on each side, blackish in colour.	0.726162
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to keep your hand too long in phlebotomizing those, because there are arteries underneath them.	Cut them; but be careful not to go too far in your incision, for beneath them lie arteries from which there may be haemorrhage.	0.70527685
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are the ones where blood usually flows in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways, either puncture with the myrtle or olive phlebotomy tool with a declining subtlety; or cut with a knife-like phlebotomy tool, called alnessil, and this is its form:	The three veins that are opened in the elbow are the veins which universal custom has used for bloodletting. There are two ways of venesecting these: either by piercing with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel or a rather fine olivary; or by cutting with a knife-edged scalpel, the lancet whose figure follows. The broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.	0.74776363
it is wide like some, and suitable for opening concave veins that are visibly large, and for those that contain thick, turbid blood.	As you see, it should be broad so as to serve for opening hollow, full, outstanding, obvious and thick veins, and those containing turbid blood.	0.7280131
And this phlebotomy tool is narrower and has a finer tip, and is suitable for phlebotomy of fine veins that contain fine, yellowish blood.	This scalpel is less broad and finer-pointed. It is suitable for venesecting fine veins that contain thin jaundiced blood.	0.7015532
But the benefit of the phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it extracts the blood from the diseases that are below the throat and neck, and from what follows to the chest and abdomen.	The basilic vein, which is one of these three vessels, helps, when cut, by extracting blood from disorders below the throat and neck, in the parts neighbouring the chest and abdomen.	0.7044761
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when performing that phlebotomy, to be very careful and cautious because there is an artery underneath, and if he makes a mistake and hits the artery with the phlebotomy tool, it will cause blood flow, so he should not phlebotomize it with a puncturing tool, but rather cut with the alnessil.	When one venesects it one must be careful and wary of it, for beneath the vein is an artery, so that if one is inaccurate and sticks the scalpel in too far one will cut the artery and cause a haemorrhage; therefore venesection of it should not be done with a transfixing scalpel but should be an incision with the lancet.	0.75723803
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then you should leave it and move to another, or look for one of its branches; or phlebotomize in the place at the end of the arm, because it is visible; and cut it with the alnessil phlebotomy tool as we have said.	If the basilic vein is not clearly discernible, leave it and turn to another, or look for a branch of it; or venesect the brachial cord instead, for that is evident; incise it with the lancet as we have said.	0.828061
But if you want to perform the phlebotomy yourself, then you should first tighten the arm and find the pulse point, then mark it with ink; and then bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with the alnessil phlebotomy tool as we have said; and be careful not to let the cut fall in the area of the artery.	But if you wish to open the basilic vein itself you should, before you bandage the arm, palpate the place till the site of pulsation is found; then mark it with ink; then bind the arm and cut the vein obliquely with the lancet as we said, and take care that the stroke fall some way from the artery.	0.8165154
And when you see, while tightening the binding, swelling in the place you marked with ink, that swelling is from the artery, and then you should avoid it.	If, when tying the bandage, you see a swelling in the place that you have marked with ink, that swelling is the inflation of the artery, so avoid it.	0.8045132
And if you see the blood flow in the phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, then you know it is arterial blood; and then you should quickly place your finger over it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood stops, because often it does, then you should bind the arm and leave it.	And if, on section, you see the blood spurt out like a child's urine, and it is clear and red, then you may know that it is arterial blood; so then be quick and put your finger upon it for a long while; then remove your finger and if the bleeding stops, as it often will, then bind up the arm and leave it.	0.88801533
And protect the patient from movement, be cautious with him and do not disturb him for some days until it is healed.	Caution the patient against neglecting it; let him be careful and not move it for some days, until it heals.	0.83179027
But if the blood does not stop, and you see that you do not have the necessary medicine, then you cut the artery if it appears; because its end is constricted, and the blood is stopped; or you take the bark of pistachio, prepare it, take one half and press it on the vein with a descending tightness with a bandage and powders until the next day.	But if the bleeding is not stayed but resists your treatment and you have no medicament there at the time, then cut the vessel through if you can see it; for the two ends will contract and the haemorrhage will stop. Or else take a pistachio nut shell and split it and take one half and bind it over the site of the haemorrhage with a pad and bandage until next day.	0.87330747
And then if the blood stops, good; if not, then treat it with what is previously mentioned about the powders that stop blood flow.	The bleeding may stop; if not, then treat by those means mentioned previously, namely the application of styptic powders.	0.6605463
And stopping the blood there is difficult in many cases because of the small area of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.	It is not difficult in most cases to stop the bleeding, because the wound is small and it is easy to bandage the arm.	0.75154746
But the phlebotomy of the fusca vein benefits by extracting the blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.	So get to know it. Venesection of the median vein results in drawing off blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; this being due to the fact, as we said, that it is composed of a branch of the cephalic and a branch of the basilic veins.	0.81994313
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be cautious when performing phlebotomy on it, because there is a nerve underneath it; and if he punctures with the phlebotomy tool and hits the nerve, it will cause numbness, and its healing is difficult, and it may never heal completely. And this nerve is sometimes felt; and if it is hidden in some people and is thin and not visible, then you should place the phlebotomy tool with which you perform the incision with the alnessil, and avoid the nerve with your skill.	The venesector should be very careful in opening it because there is a nerve beneath; and if he takes the scalpel too deep and hits that nerve it will cause stupor, the healing of which will be difficult and perhaps even impossible. Generally this nerve can be felt, but if in some persons it lies hidden and is slender and not discernible, then you should make your venesection an incision with the lancet and diligently avoid the nerve.	0.7974549
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you make the vein longitudinally.	If the vein lies between two nerves you should cut it longitudinally.	0.76465917
The benefit of the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and is beneficial for diseases of the eyes.	The cephalic vein: section of it is effective in drawing blood from the head and in diseases of the eyes.	0.70969164
And it is necessary in this one specifically, if you want to phlebotomize it, to use the olive or myrtle phlebotomy tool; because it is the safest of all veins, since there is no artery or nerve underneath it.	Particularly in this vein you ought, if you wish to incise it, to make your incision by puncturing with the olivary or the broad myrtle-leaf scalpel, for this is the safest of all veins as there is neither artery nor nerve beneath.	0.7779238
But nevertheless, it often becomes inflamed in some people, when it is not phlebotomized with the first percussion, but this inflammation does not harm at all.	It will not injure it, if at the first cut you miss the vein, to repeat the incision several times; except that in some people it will sometimes swell up if the section is not made at the first stroke; nevertheless that swelling will do him no harm.	0.6438089
The first thing you need to know is that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health and with the hope and caution of preventing diseases, and that phlebotomy should be done in one of the veins in the elbow, that is: cephalic, fusca, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter after a meal, when there are signs of fullness.	First you should know that venesection may be employed either for the preservation of health or in cases of disease. When used for the preservation and maintenance of health and for guarding against the occurrence of disease, the venesection should be in one of the three vessels at the elbow, cephalic, median, or basilic; and it must be performed at the beginning of spring when the signs of repletion appear.	0.73848593
And phlebotomy should be done on the third day or the first after three hours of the day have passed.	The venesection should be done on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of the day have passed.	0.6635622
But phlebotomy that is administered, when it causes convenience and necessity, whether by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.	On the other hand, venesection administered for diseases has no fixed hour but when need and necessity arise, either by night or by day, at any hour, in any season.	0.6591201
And it is necessary that a child is not phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman is not phlebotomized except from the fourth month to the seventh, and the elderly are not phlebotomized who have already passed sixty years.	Children should not be venesected until their fourteenth year, nor should you venesect old men of over sixty years.	0.6945758
And when someone wants to be phlebotomized in any manner, it is necessary to cleanse their bowels before the phlebotomy with a leon enema, if there is much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw the impurities in the phlebotomy from the bowels, which are putrid, and do not harm the principal organs.	When anyone has decided to be bled, for whatever reason, first of all his bowels must be purged with a gentle enema if they contain much excrement, lest at the venesection putrid superfluities be drawn from the bowels into the veins, that might harm the chief parts of the body.	0.7355763
And patients with excessive nausea and hangover should not be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or drunkenness until it has passed, nor those suffering from dropsy, and phlebotomy should be avoided near colic pain and vomiting, and near bowel conditions, and near excessive coitus and work and exercise from fasting or vigils and any cause that weakens the strength, whether bodily or animal.	No one suffering from indigestion or surfeit or drunkenness should be venesected until recovered from these; nor a dropsical patient. Beware also of venesection after stomach-trouble or vomiting or diarrhoea or much intercourse or fatigue or exercise or sleeplessness or fasting and anything else that diminishes the strength both bodily and spiritual.	0.7809262
And also consider the thinning of humors before this if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if it is possible to do so.	Then, beforehand, see to the refining of the humours, if the blood be thick, by means of food and drink and medicines, if that is practicable for him.	0.826234
And take a bath beforehand if no cause prohibits it, or exercise in some way so that the blood is thinned.	Then, if there is no contra-indication, let him enter the bath; or let him take a little exercise to make the blood thin.	0.72747993
And perform the phlebotomy in the morning, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.	Then perform the venesection in the early part of the day, as we have said.	0.6610869
And make sure that the patient's peace is guarded on that day from all bad animal accidents, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, such as excessive work, pain, coitus, and similar things.	Let him endeavour on that day to have his mind free from all such evil spiritual affections as anxiety, anger, or fear; and from all bodily affections such as excessive fatigue and weariness and intercourse and the like.	0.724426
And at their side, have present the things that men usually use with aromaticity and fragrance, and with balm and similar things according to the quantity possible.	There should also be in the place where he is sitting such things as are customary for men to enjoy, such as various perfumes, aromatics, and music, and the like, as each one may.	0.61386746
And the phlebotomist should sit on a stool that is higher than the stool of the one who is to be phlebotomized.	Then the venesector should sit on a cushion raised above the cushion of him whose vein is to be opened.	0.5844146
And then, extend their arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with their hand two or three times; and then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it around twice.	Then let him stretch out his arm, and let the venesector chafe it two or three times with his hand; then he should bind a bandage round it by means of thongs twisted two or three times.	0.874019
And let the tightness be moderate, because if the tightness is not equal, or if it is too tight, it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, it prevents the proper flow of blood outward.	The ligature should be moderately tight, for any other sort of ligature, be it too tight or too loose, will hinder the flow of blood.	0.6620971
And after the tightening, the one who is to be phlebotomized should rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and become visible.	After putting on the tourniquet the patient about to be venesected should chafe his own hands together until the veins swell up and become obvious.	0.65146196
And then the phlebotomist should anoint the phlebotomy tool with a bit of old oil; and then place the index finger of the left hand on the vein, below the spot where the phlebotomy is to be done, so the vein moves slightly, and the tapping ceases because some veins act like a fleeing string towards the phlebotomy, and some are full of air and when you place the phlebotomy tool on them, they contract towards the tool, and the phlebotomist is deceived; and the tool does not open the vein, and if it does, the vein becomes narrow.	Then the venesector should wipe over his knife with a little olive-oil, preferably old. Then he should place the forefinger of his left hand on the vessel itself below the place where he wishes to cut, lightly, so that the vein does not slip away and elude the stroke; for there are some veins that you may find like cords slipping away at venesection, while others are filled with flatus and when the knife is applied to them they contract under it and deceive the operator and the knife fails to open the vein or makes only a narrow opening.	0.8212181
And therefore, the phlebotomist must be firm and diligent in all these matters.	Wherefore it behoves the venesector to be firm and deliberate in all these cases.	0.70587575
And then place the phlebotomy tool, but if the vein is not opened at once, then it is good; otherwise, you should try again a little below that spot, or above it with speed, if the spot is not inflamed.	Then he should apply the knife and if the vein is opened first time, good; but if not, let him repeat a little lower down or a little above, quickly, if the place does not swell.	0.7632624
And if the spot is inflamed, or the patient is scared, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligature, as it may quickly attract a cautious inflammation, and do not take a bath.	If it does swell or the patient be anxious, then leave him for a day or two and do not bandage, for that might perhaps provoke an abscess; nor let him go to the bath.	0.8067842
And then repeat the phlebotomy if it is necessary.	Then if he likes, let the venesection be repeated.	0.5515074
And if the opening is small and the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the quantity of blood desired will not be released, then you should repeat the phlebotomy in that hole with precision and enlarge the opening a little, and do this quickly before the spot becomes inflamed, because the spot becomes inflamed in many people due to a small opening.	If the knife has made an opening but it is small and the flow of blood is feeble and you fear that the amount of blood you require will not come out, then gently insert the knife again straight into the same opening and widen it a little. Do this speedily before the place swells up; for in many people the place swells up at once from a small opening.	0.7503556
But if you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat it there, as there is no reason; and place some portion of the oil bandage on it, as it alleviates the blood flow. And it is better in this case than oil and other oils.	But if you see it swell up, on no account make another incision for it will be ineffectual; but apply to it a little lees of oil, for that will facilitate the flow of blood; it is superior in this situation to the oil itself and to all other unguents.	0.8686282
And similarly, administer an oil bandage in every phlebotomy in which you phlebotomize the veins to prevent blood flow, and use this theriac alfadoc and sagzenea when placed on the spot, as the blood becomes thinned and mixed when it is thick.	Therefore use lees of oil in all cases of venesection when the flow of blood is hindered. The great theriac and shakhzanaya both have the same effect, for when the blood is thick it is rendered thin and running.	0.6380044
And if a large abscess forms at the phlebotomy site, which often happens, especially to one who has not been bled before, or if the vein's opening is small, then hurry, and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly heated, and tighten it for an hour, because it will dissolve.	If there occur a big tumour at the site of venesection, as often happens, especially with a man who has not previously undergone venesection or if the opening in the vein be small, then quickly apply to the place a sponge soaked in lukewarm salt and water and bandage it for a while, then it will go down.	0.7539094
And it is necessary to do this after the blood has flowed from that vein, with the closure of it or another vein.	You should do this after the blood has gone out altogether from the same vessel or from another one.	0.769544
And if there remains some darkness or greenness at the spot for a few days, it does not harm; and if you wish, place on it something made of aloe and dissolved myrrh, or something of mint or calamint juice or something similar.	If there remain after some days some discoloration or greenness at the site it will not hurt; if you like, apply some solution of myrrh and aloes, or juice of penny-royal or something similar.	0.8405713
And often abscesses and swellings occur due to phlebotomy of the basilic vein.	Often in section of the basilic vein there occurs tumour and swelling.	0.6986891
And then place your hand on it, and if you find softness under your compression on it, then that swelling is bad and harmful; and then be careful not to place on it any of the things we have mentioned, because it may quickly cause blood to flow from the artery.	Put your hand upon it, and if you find that it sinks when pressed then it is a harmful swelling; be careful not to apply to it any of the things we have told you; for often arterial blood comes from it.	0.8382567
And make a plaster with something that has astringency, so that the spot is hardened, and then treat it with other care until it is healed.	But apply a poultice with some styptic qualities, to harden the place; then treat in the usual way until healed.	0.67941993
And you need to extract blood from everyone according to the amount of their strength and according to the dominant color of the blood as it appears.	Now in each case you should extract blood in proportion to the person's strength and to the prevailing colour of the blood.	0.736997
Because if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it is thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.	If the blood be black, let it flow until it becomes red; in the same way, if you see it is thick, let it run until it is thin; and again, if it be sharp, until its sharpness is gone.	0.9342685
And it is necessary for someone who is full and strong and needs a single blood extraction, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and the opening wide.	In the case that is plethoric, robust, and requiring venesection just the once, the incision should be wide and the knife should be broad.	0.59910285
And in someone who is frail, do the opposite, and the blood should be extracted in multiple sessions, and the opening should be narrow.	And on the contrary for the debilitated person, in whose case you should venesect several times and the opening should be small.	0.7666368
And the best way to administer vein phlebotomy is that the cut be transverse, not punctured.	The best method in venesecting is if the incision be at an angle, oblique, cutting, not piercing.	0.6417085
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow and nerve incision, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy along latitude and longitude.	This manner of venesecting is safe from haemorrhage and from cutting the nerve; it is better and safer than cutting straight across or straight along.	0.6922127
And for those prone to fainting from phlebotomy, it is necessary to treat them before phlebotomy with a little bread soaked in pomegranate wine or simple heated oxymel; and extract a little blood in three or four sessions.	To the patient who habitually faints during venesection you should give to eat beforehand a little bread macerated in the juice of unripe pomegranates or oxymel, if he be of a warm temperament; and draw off the blood in three or four instalments.	0.77988124
And if there is a cold constitution, then before phlebotomy take bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey syrup flavored with spices like pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar, or in a very fragrant aromatic syrup.	And if he be of a cold temperament let him take beforehand bread macerated in syrup of quinces or in aromatic syrup of honey or in fragrant syrup of basil.	0.6694325
And if fainting occurs due to phlebotomy, and it is caused by a lot of blood loss, then it is necessary to drink meat broth and very fragrant subtle syrup; and use aromatic substances with aloe, and rub their chest with it.	If the patient faints during venesection and the cause is great loss of blood, then be should be given to drink meat-juice and thin syrup of basil; and he should perfume himself with galia moschata and anoint his chest with it.	0.7176955
And use other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on fainting due to evacuation.	And for the rest, use what we have spoken of in its place in the chapter dealing with fainting due to evacuation.	0.8154937
And anyone who wants to vent their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, it is necessary for those whose phlebotomy is for large evacuation, and their strength is weak, to evacuate the blood little by little, that is, according to their strength, in continuous days.	As for him who wishes to ease his arm and draw off blood a second time, when he is undergoing the venesection on account of great evacuation and the lowness of his strength, you should let the blood slowly, in proportion to his strength, on successive days.	0.7973445
But anyone who wants to vent their arm and expel their blood a second time, and their body is strong, should do this around seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.	For him who wishes to ease his arm and draw off blood a second time, being of robust body, it must be done seven or nine hours from the first venesection.	0.82497686
But anyone who wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite side of the part to which it flows should be vented on the second or third day.	He who wishes to draw blood from his body to the side opposite to that toward which it tends, should be eased on the second or third day.	0.88989294
But a body in which there is a lot of blood already heated and acute and causing fever, it is necessary to expel a large amount of blood at once, and the opening should be enlarged until fainting occurs, after you have maintained all the conditions of phlebotomy; and place your hand on the pulse to prevent death instead of fainting, as this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.	He who has abundant blood that has become hot and sharp and has produced fever should be bled at one time, and a large amount should be taken with a wide opening, until he faints (all the rules of venesection having been observed by you); but you should keep your finger on the pulse while the blood flows lest death take the place of fainting, for that often happens when the venesector is ignorant and there is carelessness.	0.79393536
And it is not necessary when you want to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, as the opening of the vein is already closed and the blood flow is difficult, to press on it with force and the bent arm is slightly extended, as this is very bad.	If you wish to loosen the arm and let blood a second time and you find that the opening of the vein is now closed up and the outflow of blood is difficult, you should not press hard upon it nor twist the arm violently, for that is very harmful.	0.87049145
First, leave it until it can be phlebotomized a second time; or remove the coagulated blood at the opening of the vein with the sharpness of the phlebotomy tool; or apply theriac alfarach, or sagzenea on it, and compress it lightly until the blood flows out.	Either you must leave him a while and then bleed him again; or the clot of blood can be removed from the opening of the vein by using the blade of the scalpel, or by applying some salt dissolved in water; or apply some of the great theriac or shakhzanaya; and put light pressure upon it until the blood comes out.	0.74040306
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation has subsided.	But if the vein has begun to swell, leave it and do not touch it until the swelling has subsided.	0.8293307
And if you are forced to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no other option, then you bleed from that spot or from another vein in the other arm.	And if you are unavoidably called to let blood again, venesect either above the place or in the other arm or another vessel.	0.78141487
And the vein called "funis del bras" is phlebotomized instead of the fusca or the basilic vein when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those.	Section of the cord of the arm: this is cut in place of the median and basilic veins when these are not to be found or are hidden; for this vein is composed of those two.	0.5782597
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that the patient immerses their hand in warm water until the skin reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible.	The way to venesect it is for the patient to dip his hand in hot water until the forearm is red from the warmth and the vessel stands out distinctly.	0.5869066
And then it should be tightly bandaged with moderate tightness; and then phlebotomize it with a small transverse cut, not longitudinally.	Then bandage a little above it with a moderate pressure, and then cut the vein a little obliquely, neither transversely nor longitudinally.	0.73227555
And the opening should be wide and your phlebotomy should be done on the vein a little above the wrist.	The incision should be broad, and you should make the cut a little above the wrist.	0.6976055
And if the blood flow is restricted, then immerse the hand in warm water again and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve the desired amount.	If the blood does not flow easily, have the hand again put into the vessel of hot water and let the blood flow into the water until you have extracted what is needed.	0.7448468
But if it is during the summer, then you are excused from immersing the hand in warm water again, and it is better to immerse the body of the blood in warm water during the winter.	If it be in the summer time you may be able to dispense with putting the hand back into the hot water; it is mainly in winter that you let the blood flow into hot water.	0.8137802
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.	Venesection of this vessel is safer than all others for beneath it there is neither artery nor nerve.	0.76495975
And the phlebotomy of the right hand’s vein is beneficial for liver diseases.	Section of the salvatella of the right hand is efficacious in case of diseases of the liver.	0.61166185
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that you tightly bandage the hand or use your hand, after immersing it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you cut it completely, it will not harm in any way.	The method of venesecting it is to tie a band round the wrist or grip it with your hand, after you have put it in hot water until the vein is swollen up and is plainly to be felt; then cut it somewhat obliquely; if you cut it right through that will not matter at all.	0.73817486
And make sure not to press the hand too much with the phlebotomy tool, because beneath it are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.	But be careful not to go too far with the knife, for underneath there are the tendons of the fingers and the place is bare of flesh.	0.5782229
And then immerse the hand in warm water again and let the blood flow into it, because if you do not immerse it in warm water again, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein and restrict the flow.	Then put the hand again into hot water and let the blood flow; for if you do not put it into hot water again the blood will clot in the opening and will be prevented from flowing.	0.8960898
And when the blood is extracted according to the needed amount, then apply oil and salt on the vein to prevent it from closing too quickly; and similarly, this should be done on all narrow openings.	When you have extracted the required quantity of blood, put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not heal too quickly. You should act thus with every narrow branch.	0.83552134
But the benefit of the phlebotomy of that of the left hand is that it is beneficial for spleen diseases.	Incision of the salvatella of the left hand is of value in diseases of the spleen.	0.5516603
And do similarly in the phlebotomy of it as you did in the other.	Venesection of it should be carried out in the same manner as you did in the other.	0.6661058
And the benefit of the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the uterus, and menstrual retention, and diseases of the kidneys and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.	Venesection of the saphena is beneficial in diseases of the lower part of the body, such as afflictions of the uterus and retention of the menses, and for diseases of the kidneys, and for chronic ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.	0.7898798
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that the patient immerses their foot in warm water and rubs it until the veins are clearly visible; and bandage above the ankle with a strap; and the location of the vein on the heel is visible towards the big toe, and from it branch many veins on the surface of the foot.	Now the manner of venesection is for the patient to put his foot in hot water, then friction should be applied to it until the veins fill up; then bind a thong over the joint of the foot; then the site of the vein at the ankle is shown up running toward the big toe and forming many branches on the surface of the foot.	0.7265128
And then phlebotomize the widest branch or below the calf towards the heel towards its junction, as it is better and safer.	Then make your incision either in the broadest branch or at the ankle before it ramifies, for that is better and safer.	0.748935
And if you phlebotomize it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves beneath it on the surface of the foot, and apply the phlebotomy transversely, almost as if you were cutting it.	If you venesect it on the surface of the foot, be careful of the tendons that are beneath on the surface of the foot. Make the incision obliquely as though you were cutting the vein through.	0.7022172
And the phlebotomy should be gentle.	The knife should be a lancet.	0.40113884
But if the blood flow is restricted, then immerse the foot in warm water again and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.	If the flow of blood be impeded, put the foot back again into hot water and let the blood flow out into it until it is evacuated.	0.8856875
And if the phlebotomist makes a mistake the first time, then try again a little higher, as the location is safe; and do not fear harm, but beware of the nerves as we have said.	If the venesector makes a mistake the first time in the vein to be cut, let him repeat the section a little higher up, for the.place is safe; you need fear no mischief as long as you are careful of the tendons, as we said before.	0.7071618
And similarly do the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.	In the same way you may deal with the saphena of the other foot.	0.66301334
And for the sciatic vein, the location as we have said is towards the heel below the outer ankle.	Now the position of the sciatic vein is, as we said, on the outside near the heel.	0.75425386
And the benefit of the phlebotomy of it is for hip pain when it is due to bad blood.	Section of it is effective in pain in the hip when it arises from hot blood.	0.5309243
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that the patient enters a bath, and quickly and tightly bandages the thigh from the side of the hip down to the heel about four fingers in width with a long, thin bandage, because it is only visible in this way.	The way to venesect it is to make the patient get into the bath. Then hasten and bandage his leg from the hip to a distance of four fingers above the heel, with a long narrow bandage; for only this will cause it to appear.	0.63129115
And then when it appears, phlebotomize it with whatever tool you can and transversely, as it is better; or cut it by incision or section, as the location is safe.	When it has appeared then open it in whatever way you can; at an angle, which is best, or right through, or only cut it open, for it is a safe place.	0.7216333
And it is very hidden in many people; and if you find it, and it is not visible by touch at all, then phlebotomize any branch of it, which is the one that appears on the back of the foot towards the little and ring toes.	But in many people it is very hard to find; and if you do not find it or it is in no way palpable, then venesect one of its branches, which will be seen on the surface of the foot towards the fourth toe and the little toe.	0.7874645
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow the desired amount.	Be careful of the tendons, and let the amount of blood you require.	0.8075777
And then untie the bandage and apply cotton on the phlebotomy site and press the spot, as it heals quickly.	Then loosen the bandage and apply cotton wool to the site of the section and bandage the place; it will heal quickly.	0.75688595
