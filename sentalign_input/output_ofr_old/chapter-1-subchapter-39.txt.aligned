Of the womb/uterus	On cauterization of the womb.	0.4116783
When the womb is cold and moist, and yet does not fail to conceive, and the menses are corrupted and their periods delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary to make three cauteries around the vulva, as we have said for the cauterization of the bladder, and two cauteries on the outside of the back; and let the cautery be key-shaped, as we have said.	When matter arises in the womb from chill or humidities and she is thereby prevented from conceiving and her menses are upset; their flow fails or, as they pass, pain accompanies them; then you must cauterize her three times around the navel, as we have mentioned in cauterization of the bladder; and once or twice in the lumbar region in the lower part of the back over the hips. The cautery should be claviform.	0.80368054
