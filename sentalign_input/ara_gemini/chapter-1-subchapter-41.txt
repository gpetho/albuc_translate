Chapter forty-one on cauterizing the sciatic nerve.
If pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and humidity, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the division, but the treatment was not successful, and this becomes chronic, then it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors with habb al-muntin (asafoetida) or habb al-sabari (aloe vera) and the like.
Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization in it is of two types.
Either cauterization with burning medications or cauterization with fire.
And cauterization with fire is of many types.
One of them is that you cauterize on the hip joint itself three triangular cauterizations in this manner:
And it should have a suitable depth, and the distance between each cauterization mark should be about the thickness of a finger, and the cautery iron should be olive-shaped.
A cauterization may also be performed in the middle, on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations.
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circle that was previously mentioned in the cauterization of hip dislocation, a single cauterization, so that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin.
This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize it with two cauterizations on the thigh, on the location where the patient indicates the pain, and one cauterization above the ankle by four fingers, slightly to the lateral side, and the cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
And if he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize it where he indicates, with the point cautery, three or four times, or more if needed.
And if he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with a single knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to reach the point of burning a nerve or a major artery, thus causing the patient a serious injury or chronic illness.
I have seen one and another of those who were cauterized above the ankle, and the cauterization was excessive, so the leg became infected until the infection reached the foot, and it became perforated entirely, and the entire leg was ruined, then diarrhea occurred, and death followed.
If the pain is in both sides, cauterize them both in this same manner.
Some learned physicians have mentioned a cauterization for the hip, whose description is as follows: A cup-like object is made of iron, its diameter being half a span, and at its mouth it is about the thickness of a date pit or slightly less, and inside that cup is another cup, and a third cup, and the distance between each two cups is about the length of a thumb joint, and the cups are open on both sides, and their height is about one or two thumb joints, and a handle of iron is made for them, firmly attached to the cups, and this is its image:
Then it is heated in the fire until it becomes red and throws off sparks.
Then it is placed on the hip joint while the patient is leaning on the healthy side.
Then cauterize him with three circular burns at once.
Then leave him for three days and dress it with ghee.
And leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals.
The author of this book said: This type of cauterization we rarely use because of its ugliness and the dreadfulness of its appearance.
And because of the scarcity of those we find who can bear it, except that it is a good cauterization for those who endure it and its proper place is affected.
As for cauterization with burning medications, it is that you make two cups, similar to the rings into which the bolt of the door descends, of copper or iron.
Let there be on their edge a height of about two knuckles or so.
And let the distance between them be the width of a finger.
And let them be open at the bottom, open at the top.
And let them be held together in this manner:
Then you apply it directly to the hip, with the patient lying on his unaffected side, and you clench your hand well. Then you pour between the two circles some of the corrosive water, which has been slightly warmed by the fire, and you hold it there for the duration of an hourglass. The patient should endure its stinging and burning, for he will feel a burning like fire until the stinging subsides. Then you lift your hand with the instrument and wipe the corrosive water from the entire hip with fresh water. Then you leave it for three days and apply ghee to it until the blackness of the burn disappears. And you leave it for some days while pus flows from it, for this is most effective for the benefit. Then you treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the pain extends to the thigh or the leg, you make a mold for it to hold the water, just as you did with the hip.
And this is the description of the corrosive water, which I have already recorded in the treatise on the Rectification of Medicines.
You take one part each of alkali salt and quicklime. You crush them and place them in a new pot that has a single small hole pierced in its bottom, the size of a probe. And you place another glazed pot beneath the bottom of the pot. And you pour fresh water over the alkali and the lime to submerge them by a finger's breadth after you have mixed them well with your hand. And you leave the pot until the corrosive water drips down into the bottom of the glazed pot. Then you collect all of that water. Then you pour it over another batch of fresh lime and alkali. For then it will be very strong and sharp, effective in many medical procedures and in cauterizing all the limbs because it acts exactly like fire.
Among the medications that can also be used to cauterize the hip are thapsia, honey of jujube, and lime with soap, ground together.
Galen related a story from an ancient man about a treatment for hip pain and sciatica, and he greatly praised it, claiming that no other treatment was needed and that it heals in one go. He even said that sometimes the person entered the bath carried and came out cured. The treatment is that green spurge is taken, and if green is not available, then recently dried spurge is taken. It is finely ground with some fat and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the leg, or on the thigh. It is bandaged and left for about three hours, or until the patient feels the burning sensation subside. Then he is taken to the bath, and when his body sweats, he is put in the basin. The pain will go away, and he will be cured, God willing.
If he is not cured, then repeat the poultice after ten days, and he will be cured, God willing.
Know that cauterization with these medicines should not be used except after purging the body.
Dioscorides mentioned that goat dung, if used for cauterization of sciatica, is beneficial for it, and the cauterization is done in the following manner.
Wool is taken and soaked in old oil and placed on the deep spot between the thumb and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat dung and ignite it with fire until it becomes an ember. Then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Then take another piece. You continue doing this until the sensation reaches the hip through the upper arm, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called dung cauterization.
