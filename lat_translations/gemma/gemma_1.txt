Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have finished with you, my son, this book, which is the most recent of my works in medicine, I have completed it after having finished explaining and describing it, and I have done so in order to complete it with this treatise which is a part of surgery, that is, medicine with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery is a work of the hand which is being practiced in our age and time, and since its secrets have been completely forgotten, except for a few passing references in the ancient books which have been altered by the hands of men: and because of this there has arisen both error and hesitation until its intentions have been closed and its purpose extended: it seemed to me good to write this treatise according to the order of this book, and in accordance with its declarations and abbreviations: and that I should speak of the forms of the instruments of cautery and other implements which are used in the work, as is done in accordance with the declarations and their preparation which is necessary
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	However, because a good practitioner of this work with his hand is not to be found in our age, it is because the art of medicine is long, and the author must exercise himself beforehand in the science of anatomy as Galen has said, until he knows the functions of the limbs, their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, and lacerations, and the number of each, and their exit, and the pulsation of the veins, and the quietness and location of the exits of the veins.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	For this reason Hippocrates said that the name is much more important than the work, and that it is especially so in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already mentioned this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is ignorant of what we have said concerning anatomy will fall into error, and will endanger men’s lives: as I have seen many of them who have formed themselves in this science without knowledge and without experiment
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What is this, since the doctor has secured the scrofula in the woman's neck with a stolidum, and it has injured some arteries in the neck: why does blood flow from the woman, until it dies between her hands?
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And the doctor has also said that he should extract a stone from the bladder, which had become enlarged, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So it came to pass that he extracted it with the bladder stone
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	And the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I too was called to extract it: and I saw from the greatness of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And the doctor saw another case where a certain Duke of our land was taken ill because of a medicine: and it happened to his black slave that was with him, that he fractured his leg near the ankle: and the doctor, with his ignorance, did not know how to treat it, and he bound the fracture with barley straw and nails, and with great tension, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	And he died according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he dismissed him for a few days, and commanded him not to move his ligament: and he stood thus until the swelling of his leg, foot and ankle had gone down.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called to him again: and I set about resolving the ligament: and there was peace, and he was relieved of his pain
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	But it was confirmed that the corruption was in the limb: and I was unable to restrain it
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So the corruption ceased to walk in the limb until it died
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And behold the physician who hath performed an incision upon a cancerous swelling: and it is ulcerated after days, until the malice thereof hath been magnified with the lord himself.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	When the cancer is pure of black bile, it must not be sutured up with an iron hook, except in that limb which can tolerate it, that the whole of it may be excised.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, my son, you must know that an operation is divided into two parts: namely, that which is associated with health, and that which is associated with peril in various dispositions
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	I am grieved throughout all this book in every place where an operation is mentioned, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	For it is necessary for you to be cautious of this, and to show discretion: that they do not learn to speak insolently, and to be dishonest.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Receive therefore measure with care and protection, and the sick with facility and firmness, and use the gentler way that leads to greater glory to God for health and praiseworthy succession: and banish from you the terrifying diseases that are difficult to heal: and take away the spirits of those who make you fear, so that there may be confidence in your faith and comfort in your heart.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For there remains in this world a remaining glory to us, and a sublimity, and ultimately a greatness of spirit
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galenus indeed has said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not make the physician the author of evil: do not call the physician by a bad name.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have indeed divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cautery with fire, and on cautery with acute medicine, capitulated, and ordained from head to feet, concerning the forms of instruments, and of the instruments of cautery: and all that is necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and enucleation, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and things of that kind: and all in all concerning the forms of instruments
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of torsion, and things of that kind: capitulated, ordained from head to feet, concerning the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory be to God.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the use of cautery, and the preparation of the wound: and in what complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	However before any operation be undertaken with this, it is necessary to state the qualities of the instruments, and the preparation of the wound: and in what complexion it should be used
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore that the discourse concerning the quality of the cautery instrument, and its preparation, is a lengthy, subtle, scientific, and hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And many learned men have spoken on this, and they have differed in their opinions: and indeed little is to be gained from their discourses, fearing the length of the matter
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore that cautery is useful for all complexions, which is with matter and without matter: except for two complexions which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	Complexionis autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Heat and dryness are complexed with the loosening of material things.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	Some say that the Cauterium is useful in this case, while others deny it, because it is not suitable for heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is heat, and it is unsuitable to remove heat and dryness by means of heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And others say that the Cauterium makes an ointment in all heat and dry humours that happen in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man, and moisten it, to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	I also say this from experience which I have had of it.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	It is true that it does not suffice to say that it is useful for this or that, except that it has been proved by experience, and exercised in the last exercise of the Cauterium, and has learned the different humours of men, and their disposition, and the causes of these, and their accidents, and the time of their action.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Except for these humours, there is no fear of them: and especially in cold and wet humours.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all the doctors agree on this: and they do not deny the use of the Cauterium in these things.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And behold, the sons say that from the secret of the Cauterium with fire, and from its goodness, it is better than the Cauterium with burning medicine: for fire is simple, whose action does not endure, except upon that which it is cauterized: and it does not harm any other member connected with it, except for a slight wound.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	Action of inflammation extends beyond the limits of the limb: and it may cause difficulty in healing of the limb itself, or even destruction.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, on account of its subtle nature and the excellence of its substance, does not cause this, except in excess.</start_of_turn>
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	I have learned from experience, through the length of my service and the study of the art, and by observation of things: and for this reason I make excuse for the length of the speech.</start_of_turn
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And even if it were not permitted for this book of mine, I would tell you a secret of fire, and the quality of its operation in the body, which expels diseases with philosophical demonstrations that confirm them in the minds of the learned.</start_of_turn>
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And behold, the learned men themselves disagree in the time when it is proper to use fire as a cauterium, and they approve of a better time for its use.</start_of_turn>
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	I say, indeed, that cauterium is useful at all times: for in its action the document is enveloped in fat, which is drawn out with the cauterium.</start_of_turn>
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	Especially if the cauterium is for severe and urgent pains, which do not bear delay: for they fear that from the delay there may arise an evil which is greater than the small amount of the document which is lost by the passage of time.</start_of_turn>
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let no one in the audience, or anyone who has any knowledge of medicine, think that because the physician does not immediately apply the cauterium to every disease that it is not an efficacious treatment: for indeed, the cauterium changes the complexion and dries up humors which are the cause of many diseases.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	The burn indeed supersedes the medicine by its swiftness of action, its skill in surgery, and its might: and it is possible that the ailment will vanish at some later time according to the complexion of the patient, the location of the ailment, and its skill. And that which is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluous humors in it, and that which comes to him from food and things of a like nature, except in the case of an ailment in which cauterium is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A slight ailment in a limb with few superfluous humors and moisture, like the burn of a tooth, on account of pain, and things of a like nature, is possible that it will not return in it in that pain
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this is in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	Indeed, to tell the truth, that cauterium is the most recent of medicines, is a right statement: not because of what they wish for it themselves in this matter, for they believe that there is no cure which can be compared with medicine, nor with anything else following the occasion of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the thing is contrary to this, and the intention that cauterium is the most recent of medicines is not except when we administer modes of treatment in some ailment, and they do not confer that medicine: then we administer cauterium at the end of all, and it confers: thus indeed does the cauterium become the most recent of medicines, not according to the intention which the vulgar people and the multitude of doctors understand
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients indeed said that cauterium is better with gold than with iron: and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the fineness of its substance: and they said that it does not make pus at the place of cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	This is not absolutely true: for I myself have seen this to be false, and have found that it does not make pus in some bodies without other things.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	The cautery is good with itself, better than with iron, as they say.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	When you ignite the cautery with fire from gold, you must not be aware of its quantity, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the flesh, and if you add more fire to it, it will melt in the fire and turn into flakes.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the craftsman departs from this with regard to the work of surgery: and because of this, the cautery with iron is more rapid and closer to the operation than with fire.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have set out this chapter on Cautery, according to the chapters: and I have set out from the head to the feet: that they may provide what anyone desires from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	How the Cautery is to be used on the Crown of the Head.
Caput II.	(The provided text does not include any additional sentences following this one, so the translation ends here.)
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here the cautery is applied to the mastery of humidity and cold over the brain: which are two causes of sweat, and of the multitude of flows of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of the multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and generally of all diseases, which arise from cold, such as paralysis, and sweat, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar ones to these diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cautery is as follows: it must be applied immediately before the patient with a resolving medicine for the head, three or four times, according to the nature of the patient's disease, age, and habit
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then order him to make his head bleed with a needle.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands square, so that which hand he has placed upon his belly will be between his knees.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever his middle finger reaches, that is the place of the burn with the cautery
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then ignite the Cautery Oil: this is its form.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it upon the place which has been signed with the cautery, descending gradually, until it is grasped by your hand, and then you withdraw it.</start_of_turn>
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.</start_of_turn
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that there is still some bone or quantity of hair remaining, then lift your hand again.</start_of_turn
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the process with the iron itself, or with something else if it is cold: until you see the bone, which I told you of.</start_of_turn>
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and drink it in this way, and apply it to the place: and keep it there for three days.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then apply butter soaked in the drink to the place, and keep the burn covered with the flame until the eschar is consumed.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment of four herbs, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	I have said that the more open the wound is, the more pus will be emitted: which is better and more healing.</start_of_turn
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some people say that the skin should be cauterized until the bone is reached: and keep the Cautery until something of the thickness of bone is burnt.</start_of_turn
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is bound after that which has been taken from the bone, then it is cured.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	Others say that it is necessary for the cautery to continue until it has made an imprint on the bone like the print of a knife: thus the bone will break like burnt metal. Or they put an instrument filled with a small letter into the wound, and they extract the letter when the wound has healed.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is cured, until it is consolidated
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, however, two kinds of cautery are not useful in any man except in some cases of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And throw it away: for me it is better to be saved than to be cured.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head suffers from weakness from the continuity of its natural solution: as we have testified in other limbs: and especially when the head is weak by nature: and the first kind of cautery is more beneficial for health and more useful than the second kind, which is painful.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	In the way of cauterizing the head for the whole head's pain.
Caput III.	Head Chapter III
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When there is chronic pain in the whole head: and it lasts for a long time in a sickly person, and it is used by hyeresis, and cooks, and poultices, and oils, and other remedies
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if only one kind of cautery has been used which we mentioned, and nothing else has been added to it: then consider it
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is strong by nature and not weak, and has a cold sweat: then cauterize with another kind under the former slightly
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then burn it over every horn of the head with the cautery, without piercing the skin, and uncover from the bone the quantity which we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	Then burn it with the cautery once in the back of the head in the place which is called the uas: and this is the place where the windpipe is placed. Raise your head high in this and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For in this place it is found to cause pain which is different from the pain of the other burns of the head all around
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I say this: this is the Cautery in its place: and it must be a cautery which burns the horns of the head and the back of the head more finely, so that the middle of the head is burned.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	In a hemibrachial headache, just as with external medicine and with the iron, it is like this...
Caput IIII.	Chapter IIII.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When there is pain and swelling in a part of the head, or if the pain extends as far as the eye, and it is evacuated with the physicians who make the head better, and the rest of the treatment is administered as I have said in the discourse on diseases, and it does not suffice: then the cautery is done in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with an iron
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But the cautery with acute burning medicine is like this: you take a tooth from another person and burn it, and you remove the extremities of it from both sides
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain at the same time as the wide phlebotomy, until there is under the skin in that place where the tooth of the head is taken
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Introduce the instrument into the cavity until it reaches the eye: then stretch over it with a loop of constriction of a moderate degree, and leave it in position for fifteen hours. Then remove the instrument and extract the eye, and leave it out for two or three days. Afterwards place over the eye a pad soaked in butter, until the cavity produces pus: then care for the eye with unguents until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this as some physicians of fire do, whom I have written about in the twelfth tractate on Medical Burners.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cautery of it with iron is done in this manner
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The iron cautery, which is shaped like this
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	It is called Clavus: because its shape is like that of a key, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small protrusion
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it over the place and hold your hand: and draw the iron slowly with velocity: and the amount which should be cauterized is half of the thickness of the skin
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that the artery beneath does not get cauterized and the blood flow does not increase
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the wound in salt water, and place over the place, and leave it out for three days: then place the wound with butter: afterwards care for it with unguents until it is healed
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemipelvis with the second extremity of the knife of the Cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And burn from the incision of the artery in this hemipelvis, not directly on its own.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	In this way you cauterize in the ancient hemipelvis.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating a haemorrhage, when you have done what we said in the preceding chapter concerning the treatment of diseases, and when the cure has not been effected: then you must extract the cause of the disease, which is not enough for it which we said at the first treatment with medicine, or with fire; then you must cauterise the vessel with a knife until it has bled after the sign has appeared on the place of pain with a line whose length is half of a digit, or like that. And then put your hand away from it once and tighten the ligature until you have cut through the artery, and keep it until you reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	It is necessary indeed that you should cauterise the continuation of the mandible, which moves during mastication, so that it does not become hardened at the side, or the nerve which moves itself, from which the spasm arises.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And take care of the safeguard, and of the danger of the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut off
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its cutting there is danger, especially for him who is ignorant of this and is not studious or experienced: and he sends away the operation at the first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with the reminder of the method of treatment of the accident of the flow of blood which is due to the artery, according to my custom, and in this place of my book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you have extracted the cause of the disease, which is not enough for this Cauterium, and if you have extracted the body of the patient who tolerates Cauterium in the middle of the head, as we have said, then you must bind up the wound, until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer Cauterium, which we have said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with Cauterium having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	The cauterization is better here than elsewhere and brings about a greater effect.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	The manner of cauterization in the pain of the ears is as follows...
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When it happens in the ear a pain from cold, and it is cured with salves, and the rest of the cure as we said before, and the pain does not go away, then one must cauterize: and that is what is called the Punctum, which has this shape.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then one must make the Punctum with fire around the whole ear, as it is rolled about: or around both, if the pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And extend the Cauterization from the root of the ear outwards, after you have marked the place with soot: and let the quantity of Cauterization be ten points in each ear, and like that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the place until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	The manner of cauterization in torture is as follows...
Caput VII.	Chapter VII
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture that is cured by cauterization is not except for those which happen from phlegmas, as we said in the discussions of diseases.</start_of_turn>
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And you must cauterize the species which happen from dehydration and spasm of the nerve.</start_of_turn
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you have cured this species of torture with urine and head-purgers, and hiccups, and these do not bring about your cure, then you must cauterize the patient three times with the Cauterium: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower from the temporal bone, and the third at the junction of the two lips.</start_of_turn>
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery from the opposite side of the lower part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For the cautery must not be applied to the sound part of the body.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	The cautery should be applied in a direct line from the outer angle of the upper ear to the back of the head, and also in the temple, its length being equal to the length of the thumb
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until the middle part of the skin has been consumed by the flame
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	This is the shape of the cautery, which is like a knife, and its form is not delicate like a needle: and it must be held so that the blade is not too thick
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place which has been cauterized: until it is healed.

When the ancient apoplexy has occurred, and when you have treated it as we have said, and if the medicine does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over every angle of his head, and with one in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with one in the back of the head, as above: and the manner of cautery should be as above described.</start_of_turn>
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	And cauterize with the cautery over the stomach bone: and this is the last thing to do.</start_of_turn

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then the whole head of the patient should be bandaged, and upon the head a plaster should be placed as described in the treatise on plasters: and let some of the plaster remain.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the manner of the Cauterium: and do this according to the order that I have mentioned elsewhere.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed by this, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make three incisions at the back of his head, which extend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and let the width of every incision be the thickness of a finger
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then take care of the Cauterium, as has been said before
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish to add something, and the patient is able to tolerate it: then make a Cauterium in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish to add something further: then cauterize the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then take care of it until it is healed: and let the Cauterium be repeated according to its form, as has been mentioned before.

Then bandage the head of the patient: then cauterize the middle of the head, and the cauterize over every horn, and cauterize over the back of the head, and three times over the vertebrae of the neck
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If, however, the patient is unable to bear the pain of the body in its entirety, and the infirmity is tolerant, and the disease is strong: then cauterize four times over the vertebrae of the back, and the last with the fourth cauterization, until it burns through most of its substance, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it heals: and thus cauterize according to Oliveire.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	When the cause of melancholy is excessive wetness causing paralysis, and the body is soft and wet, then take from it what will temper the brain; as has been said before in dissection. Then take hold of the head of the patient, and make a circle from the intestines outwards with thread.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head; and the patient sitting upright is held fast by all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply linimentum.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better from old butter or oil

Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this to the patient every week once, with the rest of his treatment being good, until he is healed
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures, more than by keeping your hand on the cautery: for it gives off an odor

Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the water in the eye is declared finished by the signs which I mentioned in the previous discourse, then you should begin to give the patient water, until such time as it makes an alteration in his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him away from all moisture, and let him sit in a bath, for a few days at a time.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command him to raise his head, and cauterize in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize on both sides of the two temples with two cautery instruments, if there is a falling down of water in both eyes simultaneously: or from one side only, if there is a falling down of water in one eye only: and cut through with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let there be cautery marks in them of a length equal to the width of the temples: and burn from the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	And if anything escapes from this, then immediately cut it out with whatever medicine is possible: and I shall come with my wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting out of them, and care for the flow of blood.

When the tears of the eyes are ancient, sticky: and are on the veins and arteries which are in the exterior of the head, it is verified that this is from the superfluities of cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same instrument which I mentioned in the beginning of the falling down of water, the cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cautery instruments on both sides of the two temples, and with two cautery instruments in the hollow of the cheek under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	If digestion fails, then cauterize it everywhere cautiously around the eye, above the brow’s extremity with a small cautery.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries in every part: and stretch it out for two times: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not touch your hand with the cautery, but according to the quantity which is to be cauterized of the third of the Palpebrae

Caput XVII.	On how to cauterize the Palpebrum with pins when the eyes are pierced with needles.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	There are two methods for cauterization: either with fire or with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	When cauterizing with fire, the patient should first remove any hair that is moving over the area. It should be prolonged until it becomes equal
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, the eyes have been pierced at their root: then bind the eyes shut with silk so that they do not move, until they have healed
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have healed and are equal in length, then place the patient's head on your lap: then mark over the Palpebrum of the eyes with cautery, using the figure of a myrtle leaf. The mark should begin near the hair
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put a soaked sponge in albumin or on the hair of the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	And then burn with the cautery, which is of this shape.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure which you have made gradually in many veins, until the surface of the skin, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, is burned through.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	The sign that the work is finished is when if you press the Palpebrum of the eye it contracts and the hair is raised at the puncture of the eye
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then remove your hand and leave it for three days.

Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you are treating the fistula, when even after that you have done what we said in the treatise on the causes of disease, and the cure does not take hold: then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Command the patient to place his head in your lap, and hold his head between your hands like this, so that it does not move, and does not shake with his head
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put the clot into the abscess or on the mucus of the hair above his eye: then apply the Cauterium, which is shaped like this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Then put the clot into the abscess or on the hair mucus above his eye: then apply the Cauterium, which is shaped like a sickle
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	Then put the clot into the abscess or on the hair mucus above his eye: then apply the Cauterium, which is shaped like a sickle. It is better to make it concave for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then squeeze out the fistula, if it is open, and draw out the pus from it, and dry up the same: and if it is not open, then open it up and draw out its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then put the Cauterium on the wound, which makes a cold flame.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And keep your hand close to the Cauterium from the eye to the nose, so that your hand does not move, or that it does not touch the patient: and put the Cauterium on the fat of the eye and burn it up
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you persist with the Cauterium at the beginning until it reaches the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the Cauterium once or twice, if you do not digest it with that: and leave it for three days

Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of Cauterizing the fistula, which some of the first men said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct your hand to the location of the fistula, and find it: then place within the same opening a cushion of cotton wool, that is, a small cannula, whose form is like this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	Direct your hand to the location of the fistula, and find it: then place within the same opening a cushion of cotton wool, that is, a small cannula, whose form is like this. Then pour into it an amount of liquid lead equal to a drachma, and keep your hand steady with good retention of the cannula, and do not move the patient in any way, so that it does not run, or cause the liquid lead to reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place above the eye of the patient a cushion of lint soaked in alum or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	Lead will burn the location of the fistula, and will bring about a miraculous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	When the fistula is healed, with what we have said of cautery and treatment, that is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nose-opening, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what comes to be in its own place

When the head of the adductor muscle is dislocated due to moisture, and does not return to its place in an hour after dislocation, until it has become accustomed to its return, then it should be relocated by a slight movement which, as we have testified, often happens in this way. Therefore, in such a case, it is necessary to reduce the dislocation immediately.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient is placed on his back, or on the healthy side
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin which is inside the titillum towards the upper part with your left hand: and if the dislocation has gone inwards

Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And when the cauterization is made with the cauterium which has three branches, because of this the figure of the cauterization will be of six cauterizations: and there are three branches according to the subtlety of the attempt
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	This is the form of the cauterium which has three branches
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And when one adds on this way another one, so that there are eight cauterizations in total

When cold and much moisture are found in the stomach, do not extract it from its complex until it has been expelled from it. And multiply these treatments, and do not be remiss: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, extend his limbs, and place his hands on his chest
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the breastbone of the size of a single digit with a nail cautery, and two cauteries below from the two sides of the single cautery, until a triangular figure of the cauteries is seen
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between each other so that they do not join, when pus is made
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery is the size of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the cauteries be like this without addition: and if you wish to cauterize the large cautery in the middle of the stomach like this, let the cautery be as this single cautery is like a circle like this
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And cauterize the stomach by puncturing it where it returns from this cautery: and it is that the signs on the stomach are like the quantity of this, as much as with the incisions: then cauterize with the cautery of the puncture. Then care for it with the care that preceded until it is healed.

When it happens that on the Epar there is pain from coldness and moisture, or from large swelling, until it escapes naturally from its natural configuration without superfluous discharge, and the patient is cured, as we have said, and does not suffer from it: then it is necessary that the patient be placed over the navel, and that three cauteries be made according to this figure and in this quantity over the lower Epar from the hypocondria, where the elbow of a man rests: and let there be space between every cauterium according to the width of a finger. And let the cauteries be according to the length of the body's rectum. And do not press your hand too much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of the cautery be that which is absorbed from the thickness of the skin, the middle quantity not being added: and let the patient stand on his feet
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has extended his limbs and raised his arms
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible to cauterize these cauteries with a knife when there is subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take care that you do not go too far with the cautery, and that you do not burn the entire skin, because the body is burned there, and it reaches the intestines: for the skin there is thin, as you know well
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	How to cauterize the apostemata of the Epatis.
Caput XXX.	How to cauterize the apostemata of the Epatis
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When the exiture occurs, and you wish to write, if that is the after-effect in the liver flesh, or in its covering: if it is in the liver flesh, it brings about mild pain without intensity: and if it is in the liver covering, with acute pain it is to be expected. Therefore I go, because the physicians have become fatigued with its care.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore I go, because the physicians have become fatigued with its care.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the after-effect is placed with the encasement: then you apply the cautery which absorbs the heat.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize thus with one cautery, until the whole skin is consumed, and until it reaches the fat, until the whole evacuation is complete: then care for the evacuation itself until it is healed
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not fitting that such cauteries should be used except by those who have studied the art of medicine for a long time: and for those whose hands have worked with these things many times: then indeed will you hear of such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But I would rather dismiss it, for with me it is better
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Of cauterizing in the chest.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients say that cautery with the roots of aristolochia should be used for a cold pleurisis in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you take from the dried roots of aristolochia some long pieces, one of which is taken from that, and let it be as thick as the breadth of a finger
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and kindle it in the fire
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then burn with one cautery where the continuation of the furcula meets the collar, and with two small cauteries under guidance slightly below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And also with two cauteries in that place which is between the fifth and sixth costal cartilage, declining slightly downwards towards the back: and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from the back: one where two spatulas are placed side by side, and two cauteries on the two lateral parts of the chest, the lower cautery being between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to press your hand with the cautery, but rather that it should be clearly visible on the skin, smelling of it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient people have said that there are some people who use a cautery like iron for a ray: they burn and then send it into that place which is between the ribs, until it reaches the spleen, and comes out whole: as we have said concerning the spleen of the liver
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the patient will immediately die or that a fistula will occur in the place where there is no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	In this way the spleen should be cauterized at the head only.</start_of_turn>
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the ailment of the spleen, when with this which we mentioned in the enumeration of ailments it does not bring about recovery, then the cautery must be used three times, all of which are right ways.</start_of_turn>
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of them is to make three cauteries or four in a line following the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, which precedes this figure.</start_of_turn
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the quantity of every cauterium be as great as the length of a finger, or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the mode of the cauterium be as we said in the cauterization of the liver, equally
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cauterium: and let the patient lie supine over his back
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another manner of cauterization is: as when you have two rings of cauterium: as we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus: and elevate the skin which is over the spleen, where the left elbow of the patient lies: and elevate your hand as much as the width of the body, so that the cauteria may fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two rings of ignited cauterium slowly, until when it has penetrated the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cauterium: there will remain four cauteria
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cauterium which has three rings.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cauterium after you have put it away to emit pus for many days: for this is more helpful than any other which has preceded it in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	In the treatment of hydrosis
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cauterium does not fall in hydrosis, except when it is applied properly.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating hydrosis with the methods of treatment which we mentioned in the previous section, and the cure does not take hold, then you must cauterize four cauteries around the navel, and one on the stomach, and one on the spleen, and two behind the ribs, and one in the direct vicinity of the chest, and one in the direct vicinity of the stomach: and let the quantity of depth of the cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then discharge the opened cautery, that it may emit pus over a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	Do not remove the dressing from the burn after the cautery has been applied: for two intentions must be joined together for healing to occur. And it will quickly heal with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery which is to be used for cautery of the belly is like nails: as it has been said before. And that which is to be used for cautery of the back is like olives as it has been said before
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the cautery of the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When swelling occurs in the Hydropleg (a swelling of the limbs), and they are filled with citrine urine: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the knot which is between the cubicular and lunar bones. And raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand again: and do not move it at all
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The urine is citrine, and the cautery must be used in this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each leg at every ankle, and make the cautery with the tip of the knife: and make the cautery along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other above it halfway up the leg: and on every heel make two cauteries: and discharge the opened cautery without any dressing for a long time: so that some water may remain from it: then care for it as before
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the cautery in the solution of the belly
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the belly is cured of the cold and moisture, until the retention and digestion of the urine, which are in the stomach and intestines: and that is cured with the methods of treatment, and not by nature: and the physician should endure the suffering of the patient who can tolerate the excessive virtue, then cauterize it with a great cautery above the stomach, as it was previously cauterized with the cautery of the circle, and with four cauteries around the navel, and with a cautery of the umbilical cord, and a cautery above the bladder above the large intestines, or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if the physician moistens the excessive virtue, and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize it with a cautery above the loin, and a cautery above all the intestines: and perhaps add two small cauteries above the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For such a cure is useful whose application does not err
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Method of cauterization for hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 6
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the rectum, either one or several, which are corrupted by thick, cold, or moist humors, and are cured by this, which we have mentioned in the treatise, and not by treatment: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower part of the spine under the ribcage in a triangular shape, and a cautery under the navel like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is hardened, and that his food does not digest, and that his face is pale from the urine, then cauterize him with a great cautery above the stomach, as we have said before: and a cautery above the spleen and another above the liver, with a cautery of the umbilical cord: and leave the cautery open for some time: then care for him until he is healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On how to cauterize the after-pulse following an incision.
Caput XXXVII.	How to cauterize the after-pulse following an incision.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut through the after-pulse, then ignite the cautery that absorbs heat from the rays.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the burning cautery into the cut after-pulse: and keep your last hand away until the cautery has reached the orifice of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many after-pulses, then cauterize each one according to what has been said before
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for the wound, with what is poured out of the vessel, until it has healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize with a large cautery over the wound, this is the best way to stop the bleeding.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On how to cauterize a fistula in the groin.
Caput XXXVIII.	When you cauterize a fistula in the groin, you must be very careful not to burn the surrounding skin.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the section and the work that we have narrated in its place, and turns away from it, it is possible that it will heal with the cautery
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When this happens with a fistula, and it becomes dry, pus flows from it, and the wound becomes moist.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is necessary to explore it with a fine needle
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the depth of its cavity with the needle
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then ignite the cautery, which is similar to rays
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce the burning cautery into the fistula and the amount in which the thread entered the fistula
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	Repeat the cautery over the wound until all the corrupted bodies are consumed, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the quantity required.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	Beware of excessive bleeding, if there is any: or of great veins. If the fistula reaches the bladder or the intestines, take care to protect these parts from them all
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	Do not make the incision except when the fistula is in fatty tissue: and remember that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed, and material is removed from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then you know that it is completely healed.</start_of_turn>
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if material is not removed from it, then you know that it penetrates, or that there is a broken bone beneath the surface, or as if this had happened in this place: from which remembrance will come to its own place.</start_of_turn>
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	In this way the cautery is performed on the kidneys.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens in the kidneys that there is pain from cold or from great swelling, and it is diminished by this because of the infirmity of the patient, then it is necessary to cauterize over the outer membrane of the kidneys, with cautery over the whole kidney along with the renal vein, remembering the latter.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the same place.</start_of_turn
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Because three lines will come out.</start_of_turn
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore there will be four lines remaining.</start_of_turn
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness occurs in the bladder due to inflammation from gravel and moisture, until it retains no urine, then cauterize the lower part of the bladder above the bladder, where the hair of the testicles begins, and cauterize from the right side of the bladder and also from the left side of it: and let the length of that cauterization be as much as the thumb. And cauterize with a lower dorsi cautery or two, if necessary: and let it be as before the cauteries were applied.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the matrix.
Caput XLI.	On the method of cauterizing the matrix
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture exist in the matrix, and it is hindered by this from conception, and corrupts its menstrual blood, and delays its discharge, and there is pain at its place, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we mentioned concerning the cauterization of the bladder, and cauterize over the lower abdomen, or with two cauteries: and let the cauterization be as before
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the hernia in dislocation
Caput XLII.	When there is a hernia in dislocation, and it is painful, then cauterize the hernia with a single cautery, and let the cauterization be as much as the thumb.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moisture of the mucous membrane flows down to the heel of the hernia, and becomes the cause of its displacement from its place: and the sign of this is that the thigh is prolonged over the other thigh, when they are compared to each other: and the place of dislocation is found in that space.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the patient over the heel of the hernia with a cautery of a similar size in a circle: after which it must be sutured around the circumference of the heel, as if it were being rolled up: and that the heel itself should fall into the middle of the circle
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of such a shape as has preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present, then cauterize with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery: and make the depth of the cautery according to the quantity of thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	In the manner of cauterizing for sciatica.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When it happens that there is pain in the heel of the ankle, and the cause of it is cold and moisture: and the patient is cured with this, as we said in the preceding chapter, and the cure does not take place, and the pain persists: then it is necessary to remove the cause of the pain from the gross humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and the like.</start_of_turn
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.</start_of_turn
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of cauterization in these is according to two ways: either with cautery with burnings, or with cautery with fire.</start_of_turn
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many ways.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of them is that you cauterize over the heel of the ankle with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape.</start_of_turn
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make the depth good, or bad.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space which is between every cautery be of the quantity of the breadth of a finger: and let the cautery be an olive cautery.</start_of_turn
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When however the cautery is in the middle over the heel of the ankle.</start_of_turn
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four carinae?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	If one cauterizes with a circle whose form precedes the dislocation of the anchae in the cauterization, one: in order that the circle contain the whole anchae.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the way to cauterize in Sciatica, when the pain is adherent to the anchae itself, and does not extend up to the knee and thigh
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If, however, it extends up to the knee and thigh, then cauterize with two cauteries above the knee, above the place where the ailment is there, where the pain is, and your cauterium above the heel four fingers to the outer side: and let the cauterium be in the shape of a knife
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient says that the pain extends up to near the toes, then cauterize there where the pain is with a point cautery, or with three, or four, or as many as are necessary for that
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	If he says that the pain is under the knee and above the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife cautery
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And burn in all your cauterizations, that you do not reach the nerve or great artery, and draw over that above the patient the bad document of the disease, or a contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I indeed saw one and another, who having cauterized above the heel, and having finished the cauterization, the thigh was swollen, until the tumor followed the foot, and was burst through, and corrupted the whole foot: then there occurred resolution of the belly, and death after that
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain exists in two parts simultaneously, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	Wise men have said concerning cauterization of the anus, that this is the method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make like a mark from the thumb to the wrist, and let it be at the orifice according to the thickness of the kernel of the thumb, or less: and there let be a third of itself inside.</start_of_turn>
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space which is between every mark be as much as the quantity of the thumb-knot: and let the marks be opened from two parts: and let the height of them be like a knot, or two knots: and make a handle of iron well-fitted to the marks.</start_of_turn>
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn>
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then ignite it in the fire, until it turns red, and throw sparks: then put it over the diseased part of the anus resting on the sound side.</start_of_turn

But indeed, when used with physicians who are experienced in cauterization, as you make two holes having a handle in which the belly-button descends from the air, or by iron, of the length of the wall: of which in height there are two knots, or almost like these.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there be space between each two quantities of the length of a finger, and there be an opening below and above: and that which contain themselves to the inside, according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then lay upon the heel the thumb, the sickly one resting upon the sound side
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And compress your hand over the heel very much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of warm water, which be heated with little fire, and keep it for the quantity of an hour of time: and the sickly one will bear the biting of its own teeth, and it will endure the touch, for it finds the biting like fire until the biting cease
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift up your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from all around with sweet water: and then let it go for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put upon it butter, until the black of the wound be removed: and let it go away for a few days, and it will come out with pus.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	This is the end of the treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents, until it be healed
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain should extend up to the knee, or the thigh: make for it a posture in which there is water contained, as you did in the ankle.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	This is the way of warm water: and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali, and unburnt lime of both together in an equal part: there be two of each, and put them into a new vessel, of which the lower part be perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that is to be put in: and put under the bottom of the vessel another vessel filled with water: and pour over the alkali and the lime from sweet water, which submerges both through a finger: and then compress your hand well with your hand: and let go of the vessel, until the acute water descend from the lower part of the treated vessel.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then add the whole water, and throw the upper heel over the lower heel: and the ankle until it recovers.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	The water itself is often strong and acute in nature, which is administered in many medical procedures, and in the cauterization of the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the work of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among the physicians, those who cauterize widely, such as surgeons, and masons, and carpologists, and chalk with soap, know how to mix both together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself reports that an ancient physician once cured a pain in the knee and a sciatica: and he praised his skill greatly
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that no other cure was necessary, and that he himself was delivered from the bath, already healed, because he himself perhaps got into the hot bath and came out healed
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	It is, as the old physician said: and if it is not found green, take it dry, soak: and rub it often with some fat, and put it on the ankle, where the pain is, or the knee, or the hip: and bind it, and leave it for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels the pain diminishing
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then immerse the limb in the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When the limb becomes soft, immerse it in the cushion
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain departs, and the limb is healed
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no other cauterization should be used along with these physicians, except after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides himself says that the dung of goats, when cauterized with a sciatica, brings relief: and it does cauterize in this manner
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let a lancet be taken, and oil of olive be drunk, and be placed upon the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and is nearer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry camel's dung and burn it, until it turns to charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it upon the lancet and remove it, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Do it again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease doing this until sensation returns by means of the touch until the pain has ceased
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called cauterization of the Vaccinum.

If therefore the leprosy is obstinate and does not yield to treatment as we have said above, and does not subside: and times over the limb becomes so corrupted that it encompasses the entire complexion of the body: then cauterize it five times over the head: one in the middle of the head, and the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two over the two horns, and one behind the nape of the neck.</start_of_turn
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And lastly, thou shalt hold thy hand with the cautery close, until it shall leave an imprint in the bone, and the fragments shall be broken off from it: that thereby the emission of thick vapors from it may be alleviated, and thou shalt cauterize with the cautery also over the spleen itself, as it hath been said before.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If, however, the leprosy is scattered over the patient, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary to cauterize with these cautery instruments, which we have mentioned at the head, and with the cautery over the tip of the nose, and with two cautery instruments over the two upper jaw-bones, and with two over the two lower jaw-bones, and with six over the vertebrae of the neck, and one large one over the bones of the buttocks and one above the loins: and two over the ankles: namely, one over every ankle, and two over the knees: one over every knee, and two over the biceps, and two over the triceps of the chest.

Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	Know that a patient doth not find pain in the cautery, as they do in health: because the body is already stunned by the disease
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	It is necessary that there should be large and small cauteries according to the parts and the joints: as it hath been said of the species of instruments.

When some part of the limb is swollen and the healing is done with medicines, oils, and poultices, and it does not heal, then cauterize the swollen part with cautery, according to the size of the limb or its hardness
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery not penetrate too deeply into the skin of the limb.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cauterium with herbs and honey, and for the rest of the treatment, until healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when it is cauterized at some swelling of the hand or foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the swelling will be moved away
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But it does not prevent that it should be known about the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves that move the body
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Regarding the cautery in Albaras
Caput LI.	Concerning the cautery of Albaras
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When the Albaras is old and does not yield to any medical treatment: then cauterize above the deep cautery itself, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with herbs and honey, with lentils with rose oil, with arnica leaves, with columb's blood, and with hyrundine blood: from each of these things take one part: mix them all together, and smear them over the dressing, and adhere to the place, until healed
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On how to cauterize in Cancer.
Caput LII.	On how to cauterize in Cancer.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a cautery circle around its circumference, as it returns to its original shape.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men, however, say that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	I do not see that. For I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have seen that happen many times before
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	It is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we said: or with several cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On how to cauterize in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	On how to cauterize in Adubelati
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubelati, and it is late in maturity, or because of excess fat making it swell, or because of old age, when it is decrepit due to little blood, or because of time, and you wish to speed up the maturity of the Adubelati: then cauterize around its circumference with many small cauteries, piercing through it
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let go of the wound
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will itself speed up its maturity
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If, however, you wish to perforate it with the cautery, then make the cautery into a needle, which has this shape.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the infirmus, so as to alleviate the flow of pus
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On how to cauterize in a corroding sore
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 48.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	If a limb is corrupted, it is not without cause, and it corrupts itself: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If fire is applied to a part which can tolerate it, then the fire consumes many ulcers, small and great, according to what is suitable for the place where the corruption is located
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then burn it from all sides until the whole corruption is eradicated, and let nothing remain of it inside or outside
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then keep it away for three days, and put upon the burnt place sulfur in ointment, until all the phlegmas are eradicated and the whole corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for it with nourishing ointments of flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If there is no new corruption after three days, when the flesh is naturally renewed, then this is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then burn again the part which remains of the corrupted places
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	The corruption is treated sometimes with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It sometimes arises from the place of the burn.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, burn with fire is quicker in destroying: and I have already said that the burn with medicine is in dispersion: take therefore fire there when it is needed for that purpose.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	About the burning of boils and carbuncles.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This disease often occurs in the lower parts of the legs: it is a great and spreading disease which annoys the leg
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And the burn is done in two ways: with fire, and with hot water
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As much as with fire, when cauterizing with an iron, let it be like a pennaceous wing of a bird: which is made of iron according to the quantity which it contains from all sides: and let it be slight at the edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then lay the burning iron upon the limb.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then move the hand with the cautery around the limb until the cautery reaches the depth of the limb: and leave it for three days, until pus begins to emit
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then cover it with wool and salt, and leave the dressing on it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	The inflammation will disappear from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place where the wound has been made, until it has healed
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not concaved, and multiply appear on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then apply in it a little cautery with warm water: and it is that you take a needle of air, or iron, or a feather: and lay it on the limb, or on the ulcer.</start_of_turn>
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a little quantity of warm water into the needle: keep your hand still, and move the needle back and forth with your hand, so as to imprint the mark of the needle at the root of the limb, and find the warm water to reach the root of the limb: and expect the patient to be relaxed after an hour of the warm water treatment.</start_of_turn>
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then remove it, for the limb is healed with its roots.</start_of_turn>
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do with one after the other, until you have completed all that is in the body from the cautery.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them afterwards when they have been eradicated, as when that which generates flesh from moisture remains.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Once the [disease] has been eradicated, care must be taken of the remnants, for what remains after the moisture has been consumed generates flesh.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When fever occurs from cold in the nerve, or from the fourth [stage] of fever, or from anything else: then it is necessary to cauterise the four corners and the five spaces between the vertebrae, and between every vertebra cauterise, and in the chest cauterise, and on the stomach cauterise
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	The tremor will cease when olive oil is cauterised, and health will return to its normal state against the cold.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The method of cauterising for Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When pus is expelled from the body of Albathir, that is, from corrupt large matter
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, in the first place, when it appears, it is necessary to cauterise over every head of the pus with a fine cautery with a twig of myrrh whose extremity is ignited with fire
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with a cautery like that of aristolochia longae root
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they have been cauterised, at the beginning of the expulsion, in this manner: and they do not grow: and the superabundance is broken, making the matter thin, and it heals from the inside out
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary to do this after the evacuation with a bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	The method of cauterising in the flow of blood from an artery to a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Head Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times blood flows forth from an artery that has been incised near the elbow, which happens externally, or at the incision of the apostemate, or by cautery of the limb, and the like: and this makes it difficult to close it off.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to anyone, then act promptly with your hand at the orifice of the artery, and place your finger over it: and tighten it much, until blood is stopped below your finger, and nothing escapes from there.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put in the fire a small olive-oil cautery, and many in number: and blow over them, until they are ignited cool.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from these things one, or two, or three, according to the elbow and the place where the artery has been ruptured, and place the cautery over the very wound: and immediately remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.</start_of_turn
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	And if it escapes when you remove your finger from the orifice of the artery, and extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, from those which are prepared in the fire.</start_of_turn>
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not cease to do this until the blood is stopped.</start_of_turn
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	Beware, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and do not hurry over any other harmful matter.</start_of_turn>
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to close it off: especially when the artery is large, except with four fingers.</start_of_turn
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with the cautery, as we have said.</start_of_turn
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Whether during extraction or when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	When it is extracted, its extremities recoil and blood is separated.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or a remedy is placed over it, which has the property of separating blood, and it is bound with a constrictive bandage of proper size.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever performs an incision with a ligature and a bandage, or with a burn or similar methods, does not cause him much pain, except occasionally
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If, however, this should happen to anyone who has no physician present, neither medicine: then he should take hold of the tip of the index finger and place it over the orifice of the wound, as we have said, and constrict it tightly, until the blood is driven out from above the wound, and above the artery
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be moved, but should be held there with cold water or ice always, until the blood is congealed, and has become tough, and is separated.</start_of_turn>
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile consider whether it is necessary to cauterize, or to apply some medicine.</start_of_turn>

Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have said in the first chapter that every ailment in which it is convenient to use either cauterium or burning medicine, and the causes and occasions of these, and the instruments for these.</start_of_turn
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I will treat of these chapters from the vertex to the foot.</start_of_turn
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	I proceed in this chapter as before: to alleviate the seeker's inquiry.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	Before I proceed further, it is necessary to inform you that what is contained in this chapter concerning cauterization is based on an error that appeared in the first chapter.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	Therefore, it is necessary to exercise caution in this procedure, for in this chapter there is a great risk of bleeding during operations such as opening a vein, or making an incision over a swelling, or opening an abscess, or performing an excision, or extracting an arrow, or making an incision in a stone, and similar procedures. All of these are associated with tremors, fear, and bleeding that occurs in many of them
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	I warn you, do not be discouraged by this, for sometimes things happen to people in this art as they do in the art of healing the sick.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there is no greater madness than that which is provoked by pain: for it is light in this matter, as in the case of other maladies.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when pain is excessive, it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	Therefore, when a physician gives you his remedy and says to you that it will bring you health, you must know that his words are deceptive and his medicine is harmful
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	It is not right to consent to what comes from him who comes to you from outside, whose way of life is like this
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	Therefore, you must be cautious and prudent rather than being greedy and reckless
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	Do not presume anything about it until you have learned something certain from science that confirms that this will be successful
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	Use for the treatment of all sick people, prognostication and indication of what is useful for health
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	In this name is for you an aid above acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, son, your intellect, and not take from you direction and inspiration: for it is in his hand
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed order this chapter to be distinguished by chapters, according as it follows the chapter of Cautery, from the hip to the feet: so that you may be relieved of the thing which you desire most from this, and of what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Concerning the care of water which accumulates in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You know that this infirmity happens often to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without lubrication.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it happens also from an occult cause which is not known
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than children: and I have seen it in all whom I have seen from among the masses: because of this it is useful for me to send away the operation in this case.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have seen among the children whose head was filled with water, and the head grew bigger every day, until it could not sit on itself because of the size of its head: and the moisture increased until it died
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or it accumulates between the skin and the bone: or it accumulates under the bone on the soft parts
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in this case, if there is moisture between the skin and the bone, and the swelling is small, then it is necessary to make a single split in the middle of the head: and the length of the split should be like two knots, until the moisture is cured
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	This is the form of a sponge.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If there is too much moisture and the swelling is greater, then make two incisions according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	If the moisture is under the bone and its sign is that the fluid escapes from all sides of the head: and the water is withdrawn when you press your hand into the inside, and it does not remain hidden: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head according to this manner
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	After the incision, remove all the moisture
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then close the incisions with silk and wool threads.</start_of_turn>
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then bandage it up with wine and oil until the fifth day.</start_of_turn>
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligament and care for the wound with tension and dressing.</start_of_turn>
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not tighten the head too much.</start_of_turn
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the patient with little food and little moisture until the limb is comfortable and healed.</start_of_turn
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider the size of the swelling and the collection of water.</start_of_turn
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is in the occiput more, or in the chin, or in the right, or in the left.</start_of_turn
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Proceed therefore with the incision where you see the swelling and the collection of water: and cut it according to what you are able to do.</start_of_turn>
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And be careful not to cut an artery, and cause the flow of blood, and that the patient should die from that flow of blood with the evacuation of moisture.</start_of_turn
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incisions of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Concerning the incisions of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When any swelling occurs in the head, either to the eyes or the chest, and the condition persists, and no remedy has been of avail: then the last remedy in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	One must be skilled when performing such an incision, so as to prevent the patient from fainting
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then [the surgeon] should rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the patient should grip his neck firmly with his hand or any other available cloth
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is to be found
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places where both of them are to be found are those which are behind the ears depressed: and they are rarely hidden, except in some people
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	And mark with a burn each of them: and cut each of them with a lancet as sharp as a knife, incision running to the bone: and do this across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if necessary, introduce a sponge under the artery, and cut upwards with the incision.</start_of_turn>
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.</start_of_turn>
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the artery is cut, blood flows out with the pulsation, which leaps inside frequently.</start_of_turn
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to the eye, then it must be measured by the breadth of three fingers.</start_of_turn
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	And mark with a burn, and find until the bone.</start_of_turn
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which must be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps more or less will be emitted from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	The amount of that which must be emitted from the blood is according to the quantity which appears to you from the wound of the patient and the filling of its artery
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains on the bone from the scraping of something, then cut that, so that no thick clot may happen: then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with unguents, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in their courses
Caput III.	(The text continues with the next chapter heading.)
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man an old hemorrhage, or an acute catarrh because of acrid humilities and heat in the wounds of the times, or an old soda, vinegar, and things like these: and it is medicated with the methods of the healing of medicine, and does not give relief from it: then we are experienced in these ailments of the arteries of the times, or their cauterization, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of the operation in the extraction of these is that the physician grasps the hair of the patient which are in the times, and brings it to the apparent artery in the time.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It itself is seen by you from his pulse, and rarely is it hidden except in a few people, or the heat of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then bind the patient's head with anything of his cloth: then rub the place with rough cloth
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or apply the place with warm water, until there appears to you a clear sign.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take hold of the sponge, which is before your form.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then cleanse the skin with the sponge, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then pull out the thread from the wound, and draw it upwards, until you have drawn out the thread from the skin, and make the wound empty of any cloths that are under it from all sides
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is small: then bind up the wound with the end of a thread.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut away from that part as much as the length of its extremities, and contract, and let no blood flow forth
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut away, and if it is not bound, the blood does not ascend fully
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then wash out the blood with six ounces of vinegar, until .III
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to bind up the wound in two places with a strong thread of silk: or with horsehair, so that it does not burst before the wound has consolidated, and that the blood flow may be restored
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ligatures
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this in an hour, or after an hour
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if necessary, cauterize the wound with a cautery until it reaches the bone, with a knife cautery: until its extremities have healed, and it has stabilized in the place of the work
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	It is better to do the work, if the patient does not have a fever, or has a flushed complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For cautery is from vapor, which dries up humors
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to apply a remedy
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries that the cavity be closed up as before: and they are to be placed upon the middle of the wound.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after closure they are to be cared for with dry medicines which cause the flesh to grow, and with dressings, until they are healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	And if during the operation blood flows from the artery, then it is proper to bind it off with cautery, or to close the hole with silk: and grasp your hand until the bleeding stops.</start_of_turn>
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	And if nothing of these things is present, then place upon the place of the digit your hand, until the bleeding stops.</start_of_turn>
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And bind the place with cold water, until the pain subsides, and tie according as it should be.</start_of_turn
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from this it is evident that the easiest and most straightforward extraction of an artery is with a cautery which has two blades: and let the sharpness of the two blades be similar to an almond.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	But truly they are much smaller in sharpness than two blades.</start_of_turn
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp, like two blades, they are proper for both heat and cold: and do not tear the flesh with speed.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When therefore in this is some degree of thickness, it is held in the hand of the fire and is bound off more quickly: with this therefore the work is better in every way, and easier, and more straightforward.</start_of_turn
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space which is between the two blades be the size of the digit, after you have marked two points with the cautery: and place both ignited together downwards, until they reach the bone, and pierce the artery in two places: so that the length which is between the extremities is elongated.</start_of_turn
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	They do not solidify with this deep burn.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the burn.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Take care of the acute tears that run from the eyes continuously.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are continuous tears running from the eyes, which are above the outer part of the head: and there is no need for any medical treatment with doctors, and the tears cause the face of the patient to become red, and he feels a walk in his face like that of ants: and his eyes are expanded, wet, as if they were corroded with the tears: and his eyelashes are reddened from the intensity of the tears: then the ancients resorted to treatment for these with an operation, and they called this treatment, with Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	It is that, especially for the patient, to shave off the hair on his face
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equal incisions on the forehead according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be at the distance of the nose from the middle of the forehead, and the second at the distance of the movement of the lacerations, and the third from the other side: and cauterize from the arteries which are in the two sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two mandibles, and let the space of the incision be as much as the thickness of three connected fingers: and let a sponge be prepared, or dry cloth, with which to soak up the blood
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce two acute extremities of a sponge, whose following is the shape
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision on the temporal side to the second incision: and scrape with it the whole skin which is between the two incisions, with a scraper, which is over the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do it also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this sponge, and insert into the first incision once more a different instrument, which is called the sharp knife, from one side blunt, not sharp from the other side.</start_of_turn>
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn>
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its edge sharp towards the flesh attached with skin, and its edge blunt towards the bone: and press it in until it reaches the middle incision: and cut through everything that descends from the head to the eyes: except that which appears on the skin.</start_of_turn
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do it also from the middle incision to the second incision.</start_of_turn>
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when the bleeding has ceased an equal amount, express the place from coagulated blood clots.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every incision a layer of old cotton, and place over it soaked sponges in wine, and butter, or vinegar.</start_of_turn
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that no swelling arises.</start_of_turn
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day heal the ligament, and give a plentiful infusion with warm water.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	And care for this from the basic ointment, and for the rest that heals wounds: until it is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the care of acute tears and catarrh of the eyes from the inside of the head.</start_of_turn
Caput V.	Chapter V.</start_of_turn>
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When someone has suffered from acute, severe, and sticky tears: and their eyes are swollen, parched, and pale: and their eyelashes are ulcerated, and hair falls out from the eyelashes, and there is severe pain in the depth of the head, with sighing: then take away from these causes whatever does not cause tears, and the catarrh is not from many.</start_of_turn
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	The best treatment in these matters is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	The best is to shave the patient's face promptly.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make a single incision in the middle of the face, or on the other side along the width, and commence the incision from the left ear to the right ear: and let the incision reach the bone: and stretch out your hand from the wounds which move at mastication until the bone is revealed: and soak up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the wound with a piece of cotton wool, or with strips of linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind up above with thread: and soak the thread with wine and oil, so that it does not cause a swelling
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have finished, and you see that the swelling is diminishing: then it is necessary to compress the bone until flesh begins to grow in it
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for yourself with meticulous attention to the regimen of nourishment that makes flesh grow: as if you were to take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare from this a plaster, and administer it to the wound
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	And concerning the care of the wound during the Golden Age.
Caput VI.	(The text provided does not include any content for Chapter VI, so I am unable to translate it.)
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Every thing that falls into the Golden Age is of four kinds: either a mineral substance, or one like stone, such as iron and gold; or it is of a plant origin, such as beans and peas; or it is a flowing substance, such as water, vinegar, and blood, and things that are like them; or it is some living creature.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When such a substance falls into the Golden Age, which is not from the earth and does not grow in the Golden Age, it exposes the Golden Age to the solid state: if you wash away the stone, then something distilled from oil or resin will remain in the Golden Age
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then perform the extraction and make the area firm with pressure, and pour oil into the nostrils opposite the area of pressure, after you have placed around the ear a ball of wool or cloth and extended the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Many are grateful for this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If however they do not depart, then perform the extraction with sponges, that is, fine sponges: whose form is like this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore they depart with the sponge, that is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then perform the extraction with a blunt needle of small size.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If they do not depart by this, then make a hole in the air and introduce the extremity of the tube into the ear a great deal, and pour oil which is around the tube with wool which has been softened with oil, so that there is no air except for the tube: then extract with your hand with great traction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many are grateful for this which we have mentioned
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If they do not depart in this way: then take from barley or from wheat, that is, prepared gluten, with which one seizes the wings, a remedy: and put it on the edge of the radius after you have enveloped above the ankle positioned centrally: then introduce it into the ear with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If they do not depart with all that we have mentioned, then prepare to perforate, before the swelling becomes acute, or spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of perforation is like a phlebotomy in the first place in the neck: and extract from him from the blood according to the measure of his courage.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and support his ear upwards, and find the opening of the perforation parallel to the ridge of his ear in the hollow part of it: and make the perforation in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the bone: then remove it with the forceps which are possible from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then seal the wound from the current hour with speed, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If anything falling from one grain has grown and become inflamed: then manage its extraction.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey you with respect to its extraction, then take a soft sponge, fine and smooth, according to this shape.</start_of_turn
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And manage with it the excision of that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not make it bleed, when you think that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it out with many sponges: then extract it with hooks, or with fine graspers, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction alleviates.</start_of_turn>
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But in the water which enters the ear, it is necessary to keep the patient quiet with sneezing from the beginning: and immediately cover the ear with some cotton wool: and lie upon it the ear which is in the water.</start_of_turn
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through this, that is good.</start_of_turn>
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin and smooth, and heat them with fire together, and introduce the patient from one ear into the other: and pour some salt upon his foot from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.</start_of_turn
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Do not cease doing this with the stone and the stone, until all the water has come out.</start_of_turn>
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And when the water comes out like this, take it out with a scoop or with a single sponge, and introduce the extremity of it once into the ear: and burn the other extremity with fire, until most of it is consumed.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the process with another sponge, and make it much wetter, until all the water has drained out: and extract it with a tube as previously directed in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that is within the body of the wound, if it is of small size, like a flea or similar, take care of it as I have said in the instructions
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large size, which appears to the sense: then manage its extraction with hands and instruments: and thus it is easier for all who hold the vessel
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	When you have cured it with the things which we have mentioned in the instructions on distillation and treatment, and if your cure does not suffice: then you must bring the wound into the open air.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If anything appears there from the worms, then extract it with hands or with fine instruments
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there, then take a tube, which has a narrow lower part and a wide upper part: and insert the lower part into the wound according to the capacity of the patient: then withdraw it with force.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Make it much wetter, until all the worms have drained out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you in leaving, then smear the circumference of the tube with grease, as I have said in the stone
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not leave when you have done what we have said: then perform distillations which the ancient experts have learned for the elimination of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your effusion be such as you pour oil and medicines into the wound with this instrument, which has the shape mentioned above
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As for wounds made by silver or by air, below a strict bandaging, there is a small hole, a wide one above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	The force that is in the curvature of the tube is placed outside the air hole.</start_of_turn>
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	If you wish, take a radius and encircle in its extremity a piece of cotton. Then pour oil, or balsam, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the tube: and let it rest there. Then introduce the radius with the cotton above, and press it down with your hand in a temperate manner, until oil is driven into the curvature of the ear, and the patient feels it inside: that which is poured into the ear is to be warmed with a little fire: and take care that nothing distills in the ear when it is cold: for medicines do not tolerate this.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Concerning the care of a burn.</start_of_turn>
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.</start_of_turn
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When some children emerge from the mother's womb without perforating them.</start_of_turn
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And sometimes it happens that some people suffer a burn in the ear from a wound, or from meat that is born there.</start_of_turn
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this burn sometimes happens in the depth of the earhole, as it does not follow custom: and sometimes it happens outside the earhole a little, and follows custom.</start_of_turn
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which happens in the depth of the ear, and which does not comprehend the aspect, is in many positions difficult to heal.</start_of_turn
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows custom, it is necessary to put the ear of the patient on the sole, and to press on it: then if you see the burn appearing, open the wound with a fine needle, whose form is this which follows, so that its extremity is in the part which has a small width, whose part is acute: and the rest of the needle is soft: so as not to hurt the ear.</start_of_turn
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If there is an opening from the cartilage to the meat of the ear: then hold the ear with a fine hook, and cut it off with ease until the whole flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the opening is in the depth of the ear: then take a fine needle, thread, and burnish it with fire: then remove it from the meat of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel a sense of opening with this, which the infirm has with a weighty deafness, try to open it with ease: and beware, lest you damage the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear a patch according to the quantity of the breadth of the opening which you have cut with the Egyptian unguent: make this for a few days, until you are secure about the consolidation of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a patch and soak it in rose water, and grind on it some powdered alum, and use this.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you wish to dry up the ear: then it is necessary that you remove the patch, and let it dry with another patch, which you put on a wound made with rose water, until the swelling subsides: then care for it until it is healed
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If blood flows: then immerse a sponge, or pack it in cold water, and put it on the ear: and use the rest of the treatment which expels the predicted flow of blood in the tract of distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Regarding the care of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	(The remaining text is not included in the provided context.)
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the Althelis which happen in the eyelids, when they are wet and when they are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to hold them with tweezers: or with a hook, and cut them away from their roots
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place above the wound a soft cushion.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from the wound, then cauterize it with a fine lancet.</start_of_turn>
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	It is better to cauterize after the incision.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Many times they return when something remains from their roots.</start_of_turn>
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, they burn those roots and they do not return.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Take care of the large palpebrae of the eye.</start_of_turn>
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.</start_of_turn
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many things happen in the palpebrae of the eye which assimilate Crandinum in its firmness and its hardness, and because of this it is called Grandus: and it is the collection of thick moisture in the upper and lower palpebrae.</start_of_turn
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation is therefore in the eye, as you see, if there is a Grandus proceeding from the palpebra, which appears from the palpebra and moves to all parts, and its result is easy.</start_of_turn
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore above the wound across the width.</start_of_turn
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape away the wound from all around with ease, until it is clean.</start_of_turn
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend the wound with a suture, and cut it off.</start_of_turn
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, you do not prepare the cut for abscission, except when you penetrate the palpebra with a small incision, then it will be harmful to the patient in some way.</start_of_turn
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the wound is large: then join it together with a suture: and care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	If it is small, it will not cause any harm from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The wound will restore itself, and the pain will vanish.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	If it is large, it is advisable to incline it towards the inner parts of the ear towards the surface; then palpate the area thoroughly, and suspend the large size with a loop: for otherwise you will be tempted to make an incision, and press it from all sides
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the area is prolonged by incision, that does not harm in any way
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the large size with salt water: and care for the place with that which is incrusted, until the infirmity is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	About the care of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The speck which is produced in the upper eyelid is called Axirnath: and this most frequently happens to children.  It weighs down the eyes, and causes tears to gather in the mornings, and they are unable to see the sunlight because of this, for the tears run down their face and over their eyes.  They sleep with their eyes always wet under their eyebrows, which have been puffed up by the inflation: and the prominence of Axirnath appears in the eye, and when you touch the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between your fingers.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of treating it is to place the patient's head in your lap
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen, and prepare in it a loop, and make from that loop a circle according to the quantity which contains Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over the eye, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture a swelling that has happened beside the heel of the foot, and let there be no greater split than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it may be necessary to find the whole skin, until Axirnath proceeds from the split according to the form of a white crust in multiple arrangements
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract therefore the blood with the bandage which you have infiltrated between your fingers outwards: and you will move your hand to the right and left, until it is scattered: and take care, lest you add to the split, that you do not reach the heel with the blood, and stain it.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If, however, you do not see Axirnath at the beginning of the split, you will add a little to the split with ease, until Axirnath proceeds.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract the blood as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the bandages in vinegar and water, and put them over the place, and bind them with threads.</start_of_turn>
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And from men there are some who pour salt upon it, and put it into the hollow of the split, so that it may liquefy what remains of that moisture.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, there should happen in the place of the swelling a hard calcar, then take care of it with soft plasters until it is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	As regards the methods of treating the eye, that is, when the eyelid is softened, from which it results in redness as it should not.</start_of_turn
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.</start_of_turn>
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond the normal course among the natural hair, they cause damage to the eye. This brings about symptoms such as excessive tears, softening of the eyelids, and discharge, until such time as the eye is destroyed.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	The eye is cleansed according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with the use of fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, as has been mentioned previously in the chapter on cautery
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or by incision and stitching of the eye
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with needles, as I shall explain later.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary to place the patient's head in your lap
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then take hold of the patient's left eyelid with your left hand
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If you grasp it firmly, that is good
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if you do not grasp it firmly: insert the needle at the base of the eyelashes, and pierce the needle with the thread that is above, and let the needle lie close to the eyelashes, that is, at the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and tie the knot.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	And find within the inner part of the eyelid under the added hair a mark that comes from the greater lachrymal gland down to the lesser lachrymal gland.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then draw out the thread and place under the eyelid a small piece of cotton wool or gauze: then close the eyelid with stitches that look like the figure of a myrtle leaf
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	Indeed it is necessary to observe that the figure should be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies among people
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	The eye is harmful if it requires more to be excised from the eyelid than is necessary for the amount that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	When the swelling has spread over two lines which you have signed, and you begin from the greater tear gland towards the lesser, let there be one opening near the natural hair, as is the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape away the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together with two sutures the two lips, with a needle and a fine thread: and stop the bleeding, and make fast what has been excised from the two superciliums, with some astringents if you wish to do so: or if not, do not cure it
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then remove the suture and the thread for three days, or four: then care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, remove the swelling without sutures, and care for it as before, which dries up and contracts it
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and the adhesion: but the future will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	In this way of treating Ataxmir, the ancients taught.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	It is true that there is anxiety over the infirm, but it is from a good operation, and not from fear
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another way is in Ataxmir also: and it is that the sign on the eyelid should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or gathered together, according to this figure, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this figure, with equality of the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If, however, it is not possible to retain the hook and it does not suffice: then grasp the point where the thread is located and insert it into the middle of the figure. Insert another thread nearby the larger lacrimal gland and another nearby the smaller lacrimal gland. Gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand with equal elevation: and elevate the skin above that which is signed with the mark of the pulse, as we have narrated.</start_of_turn>
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with the suture: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, swelling occurs at the incision or the wound: hold that swelling with the thumb and index finger, and with like instruments from the stationary suture threads.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelashes also swell, as they are twisted about their hair.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is therefore necessary to use what we have said concerning the incision: but the sutures on both sides are artificial.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Concerning the care of wounds made with canines.</start_of_turn
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	That you must cover the eyelash, and split the wound which is inside, as I have narrated.</start_of_turn
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two needles, or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelash, and the width of them is less than the width of the pupil: and you will have pierced at the extremities from both sides where you hold the thread.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather together both things with a slight pull over that which is superfluous from the edge of the eye, and bind two needles from both sides tightly, and let go of them every few days.</start_of_turn
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin, if tightly closed, will die, darken, and decay until it falls away of itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If delayed, then cut it through with forceps.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has consolidated, raise the eyelid: do not pierce the hair.</start_of_turn>
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the shape of two needles, which you make according to this figure and the quantity in length and breadth.</start_of_turn>
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Regarding the elevation of the plucked hair in the eye with a needle.</start_of_turn
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.</start_of_turn
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this is that you take a fine needle and introduce it under the thread of fine silk, which is soft.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you gather the extremities of it and knot both ends with a fine knot: and let the length of the thread be one palm.</start_of_turn
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make a second knot of fine thread under this one in a short space, and knot the extremities of it if you wish.</start_of_turn
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place the patient's head in your lap, and let it be close to the cheek so that the operation is declared: because the operation is slight, or even a moment.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the knot in the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you have pulled out the natural hair.</start_of_turn
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull out the hair until above the knot: and introduce into the knot the light of the hair: if there is one, or two, or three, not more.</start_of_turn
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with that [finger] which will cause the hair to emerge with the natural hair on the eyelashes.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	Then draw the [finger] which will cause the eyelashes to emerge with the natural hair on the eyelashes. If, however, the eyelashes are drawn out and do not emerge with the latter: draw the eyelashes downwards, with the thread which you have made in them, until the eyelashes emerge from the upper orifice and are visible: then draw out both the eyelashes and the thread and close the eye. Close the eye for two or three days until the hair has adhered to its place and has grown over the wound.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from the natural hair and elevate it with that: or leave it alone until it has grown out, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the care of the eyelashes which occur in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this occurs in the eye, it is called the Leporina
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	This eyelash is either natural or accidental
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental, therefore, is caused by the consolidation of a wound, or a section, or a burn, and the like of these
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	The way to operate in this case is to find the consolidation of this and to separate its lips, and to put between them a piece of silk, and to tie them together, until it is healed
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	It is not fitting, however, to use those things which dry and constrict: for if you do, the eyelash will be worse than before: rather use those things which soften, such as barley-straw: and mix with water, in which barley-meal is boiled, and oil: and smear with this the thread, and care with this
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	Your surgical skill is such, that you can deal with every ingenuity, so that it does not waver, following the fashion which was first established.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	This operation, as we have mentioned, is not without some rectification of Alxatrati, so that it does not deviate from its natural form altogether
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the care of the eye which is in the lower eyelid, and that is the wrinkle or contraction above towards the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 123.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This lower eye-lid swelling is called Alxatrati in truth.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	It is caused by a wound, or tear, or burn, or similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	As for the operation in this, you take a needle which has a double thread, and pass the needle through the flesh from the left lacrimal gland to the right one, until the thread passes through both ends of the flesh
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut the flesh with a wide blade.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If the figure of the eye-lid returns to its natural form, it is good
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	If not, grasp the edge, and place it in the split, and join it to the eyelid: and find two holes at the inner angle of the eye-lid, and let the two ends of the holes be from two angles, until they converge and make an angle: until when they converge the figure of them both is like that of the Greek laudation letter
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that part of the flesh which is beyond the acute angle of the lower eyelid from the eye-lid which follows the eye-lid
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts: sow them with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them as we have said, of the physicians of soothing medicine, and of licenses, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if the Alexatrati occurs from a wound and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you find the wound even under the eyelashes, even as before
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between two lips with a license, as we have said
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the sum of the sermon concerning the care of the Alexatrati, when it is above or below, is that you should take care of it in that operation, as it is prepared from the form of the Alexatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	Indeed, there are many varieties in the form: and a prudent artist prepares the ingenuity in whatever way is possible for him, until he brings the figure back to its natural form, or almost so, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and the instruments in many arrangements
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Of the adhesion of the eyelash to the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	When this happens to many people, it is because the upper eyelash is consolidated with the white of the eye, and it hinders its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	You must therefore introduce the extremity of the radius under the eyelash, and lift it up: or stretch it out with a hook: then cut through the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be with the sharpness of a knife, but rather blunt and round: so that it does not trouble the patient during the operation, and that it comes away from the wound with its own sharpness: and let the incision be like that which you would make to scratch that adhesion, until when the eyelash returns to its natural form, and the adhesion is completely healed
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Pour water into the eye, with water driving out the former: or distil into it from a vessel made, from gum dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with lint: and put upon the eye a bandage of wool with alum: and on the third day use the vessel, and with the solidarities, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	As to the incision of the nail and the prominence of the carnis lachrymarum.</start_of_turn>
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.</start_of_turn
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is according to two modes.</start_of_turn
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is fleshy: and is like tough sponge, subtle.</start_of_turn
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not fleshy, like frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or when you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off and does not remain in it.</start_of_turn
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both these kinds do not begin until from the greater lachrymal, until it has advanced gradually, until it covers the whole, and excludes light, and movement of the eye.</start_of_turn
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of working in its incision is: as you put your sickly head in your lap.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open its eyes, and raise its eyelid with your hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the nail with a hook a few times, and stretch it upwards.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take the needle, and introduce it through the hair of the horse, and silk, or thread: and make the thread strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce the nail with the needle, and ligate the nail with the thread, and stretch it upwards: and remove the hair surrounding the pupil, as if you are grooming the nail until it reaches the last of its hair.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then penetrate the remainder in the root of the lacrimal gland with a small spatula or fine scissors: and discharge the natural tissue of the lacrimal gland, so that it does not obstruct the flow of tears from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with only one claw: or with a thread, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is to be scraped with a soft spatula of this form.</start_of_turn>
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	Beware, lest you touch the delicate corneal tunic, and cause a rupture, and perforate the pupil.</start_of_turn
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, pour upon the eye some powdered salt, or a concoction made from sponge-wort, and keep it until the next day.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it as is necessary, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is neither sensitive nor has a nerve penetrating into its substance, and if it does not bleed in it, then it is to be treated with many remedies by the physicians, and will heal as I have mentioned previously.</start_of_turn>
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to make an incision, then open the eye of the patient, and grasp the spatula with a fine, gentle touch, of acute power, according to this form.</start_of_turn
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And remove the nail from above with caution and dexterity.</start_of_turn
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If, however, it is liable to become detached and fractured, and leaves a mark in the substance of the nail, then distil from your hour in the eye from a sponge-wort concoction, or from saffron, or from salt: and anoint the eye until the next day.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation above until the whole of it is removed.</start_of_turn
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless contrary to this, if there be a swelling in the eye which is cold and hard: then let it go, and take care of the swelling until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation with reason until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	But as for the prominence of the caruncle of the lacrimal gland, if it causes great discomfort in the eye, it is to be suspended with a thread, and a piece of it is to be excised: and not to make the last incision, lest the flow of tears be obstructed.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then leave the eye bathed in a red solution, or made from alum, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	As for the incision of the Alguardenic membrane, and the natural tissue in the eye.</start_of_turn
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in the eyes of men there is formed a red substance which covers the pupil, or approaches, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards: and it is like the seeds of roses.</start_of_turn
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for this is also to put the diseased head in your hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and take hold of the whole tissue with hooks which are convenient for this: and tear it out with one force, or grasp it.</start_of_turn
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then make an incision in the first place, until the whole of it is finished with the knife.</start_of_turn
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And burn away from the eye, so that you do not damage it during the operation: and let your incision be such as that which you make when you cut nails, or with fine forceps, with which you grasp the clot, as we mentioned concerning the incision of the nail.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When the incision is complete and the entire garden of the wound has been washed away, then pour upon the eye from a container of salt: or distill into it a powder of red ochre, and similar things from corrosive medicines: and place upon the eye a compress of wool with vinegar or alum to secure it from the heat of the afterpulse.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything remains of the wound, and the blood is hot, and the afterpulse is strong: then remove the eye and keep it with that which will calm the afterpulse.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the operation until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do the same with the meat added which happens in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	It is true that one must be careful, lest the eye be injured by a natural or accidental cause while operating with the instruments: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations, until you are certain that the limb can tolerate the operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Of the collection of the eye-wax.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	The waxes are like red veins which are stretched over the eye, and which prevent the moisture from doing its work: and they weaken the eye with their length.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary therefore, in the first place, to consider whether the eye in which there is wax is strong and not suffering from any other ailment except for the wax: then collect the wax from it
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary to be careful, lest you put your head in your lap
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend the veins with one hook or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be fine double the size, according to this form, or two hooks be united in one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine scissors those one or two which are under the eyebrow, and remove the blood hour after hour until those one or two have vanished from the eye, and they are resolved: and beware lest you damage the eye with the extremities of the scissors.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	Let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation lest you injure anything other than those one or two
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	When you have finished, then pour into the eye a little oil, or red: so that its sharpness may dissolve what remains from the wound.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with this, which will soothe the pain of the eye: and let it go for a few days. And keep it away from heat: then repeat over it according to the same method until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Of the reduction of the Arissa to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctors call the Arissa Fistula which is cured with cautery, or with acute medicine and burning, according as its narration requires.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in that: except that you find over the swelling near the origin of its formation, and you remove all the moisture which is in it and pus, until the bone is detected
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is thus detected, and you have cleansed it of corruption or blackness, then close it with an instrument whose form is like this
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the Asper of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	It is made of iron without solder, and its head is rounded like an azure, which is pierced with the point of nails, or with the point of an awl, or with a fine puncture: and place it on the place of the corrupted bone
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then move it back between your fingers, and touch your hand lightly until you know that the wound is healed: and do it often.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then apply the remedy with the aid of hemostatic agents.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If the wound is consolidated and appears in the flesh, and the flow of blood is stopped: and it remains for forty days, and does not bleed again, and does not swell, and no inflammation occurs in it: then you know that it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no wisdom in it, except to reduce the swelling to the size of a bean, according to this shape.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is necessary to remove the bone from the second degree with iron, or with acute medicine: and when it is detected, then grasp the bone according to this shape, whether the handle is of iron, triangular: and its wood is an extended pyramid until it reaches the extremity, like blood.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it above the bone itself: and be close to the tear: and stretch your hand away from the eye a little.</start_of_turn
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then move your hand with the bone until it penetrates the bone, and feel that it is weakened: for thus you will know that the marrow is coming out through it, when you hold your hand over your nose.</start_of_turn
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, then, restore the place with the aid of hemostatic agents, as I have told you.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When the flesh appears and the place is hardened: then the matter which was flowing outwards returns to the nose: thus it is easier for it to be on the unhealthy side.</start_of_turn
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ On the reduction of the prominence of the eye.</start_of_turn
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye emits with its entirety, and does not subside in any part of its document, neither does its diminution: then it is necessary to resolve the diseased part: then perform phlebotomy: afterwards place moist compresses in the cavity without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put upon the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and oil, and gum arabic
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above upon a cushion with many feathers.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the manner of the feathers is: that you take fine wool, many, and fold every feather from its four sides: make from these many: then place one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then bind upon these with a strong cloth
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the compresses with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the compresses, and keep the eye closed day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligament is again softened, then it is necessary to bind it much: then remove the ligament after day and night, as we said
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If thus you again see the eye coming out of its sockets, it is good: and if not, then repeat the cushion, and the feathers, and the binding, and the compresses, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Of the incision of the tunica of the eye.
Caput XXI.	(The next chapter continues with instructions on the incision of the tunica of the eye.)
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When disruption occurs in the tunica of the eye, then it emits and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and is swollen like a man because of this, and one must cut into this: then the operation in this is as follows: and it is that you introduce the needle into the radix of the eye from the lower part to the upper part
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle through the part where the tear-duct is doubled, and make it penetrate: and withdraw the first needle following its own arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then pierce the place where the tear-duct is doubled, and secure it with the surrounding skin of the gum: and tighten it much.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the needle, and place above the eye a lancet soaked in alum: and withdraw it when the thread has been withdrawn from the gum.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, which soothes it, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the thread is drawn from all around with a circle of cloth, until the eye regains great prominence.</start_of_turn
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pricked with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and let moisture flow, and the eye will descend, and immediately restore itself: then tighten it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	¶ On the treatment of the eye.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.</start_of_turn>
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnati, is not except for health which accumulates in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not itself.</start_of_turn
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of treatment for this is that you make the patient sit on a prepared seat, or directly.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then grasp his head with your hands from two parts, and move it, until you feel the health rise towards the lower parts of your eyes.</start_of_turn
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it becomes fixed, and does not descend, and the light is restored: and the patient sees as well as he saw: and if it does not descend further, you know that it is water.</start_of_turn
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If the preparation of the descent of the bowels is not ready with that which we have mentioned, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a soft sponge and find it above the bony prominence of the knee joint alongside the continuation of the joint with the cornea in a circle, until the bowels have departed.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When they have gone out, then pour warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have boiled barley and honey: then wash with the rest of the treatment until the eye is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	As for the care of the water that descends into the eye, or a cataract.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.</start_of_turn>
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have said concerning the species of water in the eye, and which agrees with the declaration and explanation, then take that according to the health.</start_of_turn
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then you must make the patient sit between your hands square, facing away from the light, near the heel: and bind the healthy eye shut, and clench it tightly: then take your right hand, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye: or take your left hand, if the eye is the right.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand, if the eye is left: or your left hand, if the eye is right.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then put the tip of the sponge close to the crown over the breadth of the radius in the apparent white of the eye near the smaller lacrimal gland: then press the sponge with force: and you will turn with it the hand, until it pierces the membrane of the eye: and you will feel that the sponge has reached the bottom.</start_of_turn
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	The distance from the iris to the outer corner of the eye must be measured.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see this in the pupil itself through the clarity of the corneal membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the instrument until it reaches the aqueous humor
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Press the lower eyelid downwards one after the other.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If the liquid thus descends, the diseased part will immediately move away from the opening of the eye, and the instrument will be in the eye itself
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Wait a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If the liquid descends again, then withdraw the instrument without causing the instrument to come out of the eye.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it has settled and does not ascend, then remove the instrument with ease: and withdraw your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve on the liquid some salt of the clear gemmae kind: and wipe with it when the eye is dry.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put over the whole eye a pad or lint soaked in warm oil, and alum or gypsum; and bind with it the healthy eye
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We also put upon it a rough cloth with alum or gypsum.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If it does not enter the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a person whose eyes are hard like a stone: then you must take a sponge which is called Alberid, which has this shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Wet it thoroughly with the sponge and join it to the instrument, and do not take your hand away from the hole: and do not do anything else except guide the instrument gently to the bottom of the eye
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almond, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And in addition to this, the patient is prepared with a warm bed made in the center of the room, upon which he lies upon his back in a dark chamber: and he is to be guarded against all movements and coughing: and he is to be given food which soothes the nature of his condition. And he must not move his right or left hand at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the ligament be set according to its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark chamber, and let him experience its sensation: and make him drink something
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it should not be forced at the time of healing, or immediately after incision: but rather it should be allowed to happen naturally. For thus water ascends more quickly through the open wound
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If however a thick blood clot occurs: then it is necessary to drain the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with that which settles the clot, until it is settled: then let the patient drink something by mouth which regulates his vomiting during those few days, while he remains in that dark chamber.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him gradually go out of the room and return to his home.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in the hospital a student is not excused from his studies for a few days: then indeed he will learn about the operation
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed some of those from Alayrach have reported to us that in Alayrach an almond was perforated with a needle, from which water came out
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But indeed we have not seen anyone in our land who has done this: nor have we read of it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that this is something new
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	These are forms of species from great things, as they remain over those who ignore them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Be like the air itself: and let their extremities be like those of a triangle with an acute angle at their base.</start_of_turn>
Formae magda.	Great things.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of the newborn flesh in the nose.</start_of_turn
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXII.</start_of_turn
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When various meats are added to the nose when it is giving birth, there is something that is absorbed from many feet of scorpions: from this there is a cancerous tumor, a stone, and a fleshy color: from this there is what is soft, not fleshy colored.</start_of_turn
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In this way, whatever is soft from these meats is not fraudulent or cancerous, it is necessary to make the sick person sit between your hands opposite the solid object, and open the nose and expel the mucus from it: then draw out the pieces to the outside, and cut away whatever you see with a fine and acute knife from one side, until you know that the whole meat has been removed.</start_of_turn
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If there remains something of that from whose excision is not possible: then cut away that with a fine instrument until nothing remains of it.</start_of_turn
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood dominates it, or if a thick clot appears: then oppose to it what is necessary: or that from malignant clots, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the meats are removed.</start_of_turn
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then wash the nose with vinegar after the incision, and water, or liquid.</start_of_turn
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it until the palate, then you know that it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, moisture does not penetrate, according to what is necessary, then you know that the flesh has arisen within the upper bones of the nose, to which it does not reach with the incision of the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore it is necessary to insert a thread of linen which has some thickness, and to knot it in many knots: and to place between every knot as much quantity as a digit, or less. And the patient will vomit, so that he sends out one end of the thread through the nose with the breath, or as much as possible after he has made it similar to a burr. And he will exhale his breath until it reaches the very tip of the nose, and withdraw it over the guttur.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many do the same as this young Attom in schools: and it is an easy thing for him who wishes it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place two ends of the thread, one which proceeds outwards through the nose, and the other which remains in the nose itself
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then hold the closure of the flesh with the knots which are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is again with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then withdraw the thread: and place in the nose after washing out the blood with the bath which you drank with the unguent of Egypt: do this for three days, or more, until the unguent has eaten away everything that remained of the flesh
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place at the end of the matter in the nose a lead cannula for a few days, until it is healed
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If, however, you require treatment which demands it, use that also
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the packing of the head, when oil and other medicines are distilled in the nose, do this from silver, or from the air: and make it similar to the nut of the fennel, open like a conch shell: and its cavity like that of a worm.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if one wishes to make a closed cannula, like a tube.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And if one wishes to make a closed cannula, like a tube.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	This is the complete translation of the sentence.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Take care of the nostrils.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	The teeth of the nose grow in the extremity of the nose of Thelul, and grow large and increase with the days, until the aspect of the face is changed.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this reason it is necessary, when the condition of the teeth of the nose appears, to remove all of them at the beginning
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put on the place, or cauterize, or apply a burning medicine in the place of it
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, however, the incision is delayed, until it has grown large, then consider whether it is of stone, hard, brown in color, and without sensation: for then do not touch it with iron, because it is cancerous
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many times indeed does a wound arise from a bad humor of the apostema, and this happens from the great heat which it has
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the apostema is soft to the touch, not brown in color, and there is possibility of incision throughout its entirety, then evacuate the sick person and perform the incision without fear, without hesitation: and care for the place where the incision has been made until it has healed
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Chapter XXV
Caput XXVI.	Of the suture of the nose, lip, and ear.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when a solution of continuity is made in some cartilaginous parts, it is little useful in this operation, except in some people
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore when anything happens to anyone from that [injury], that you consider whether there is a wound still connected with its blood: and then join the two edges of the wound with suture: then care for it until it is healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	If the edges of the wound have been separated from each other and have become one, then it is necessary to remove every part from its outer surface until blood flows again.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join the two edges of the wound with suture, and tighten them, and smear upon it the blood of a dragon, and balsam of mastic: and place above the powder a piece of plaster of Paris, and some other solid plaster: and leave it bound for two days, or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then remove it, and change the dressing: and leave it until the stitches come out by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The way of suturing is to join the continuity of the solution, or with a pad, as we have narrated in the suture of the belly: or join the solution with thread, as you have been told.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Of the extraction of the knots of the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people have a swelling in the insides of their lips similar to rough seeds of herbs: and some of these are small, and some are large
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to cover the lip and find on every knot of it and suspend it with a needle, and cut away from all sides
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with powdered charcoal, until the blood has clotted.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it is bound with vinegar, and the place is cared for with it, in which there is stypticity, until the wound is healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Until the new-formed flesh of the incision on the gum has healed.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many are the veins that arise from the gum of the teeth, which the ancients call abuluss.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It is necessary therefore to suspend them with a thread: or to grasp them with forceps, and cut them at their root, and let the blood flow, or the fluid.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put upon the place the bruised tissue, or other drying powders that are styptic.</start_of_turn
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	And if the flesh returns after the treatment, namely because of many veins that have returned, then cut it again a second time, and burn it: for it does not return after being burned.</start_of_turn
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Chapter XXIX.</start_of_turn
Caput XXIX.	On the reason of teeth with iron.</start_of_turn
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they are aggregated on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, their coatings are rough, and sometimes they are blackened and become soft, and they decay, and become yellow, until the corruption reaches the gum, and abscesses form in the teeth thereby.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary therefore to make the handle of your hand firm between your hands, and place its head in your mouth, and move the jaw and the tooth, in which you see the coatings, and that is like sand: until nothing remains of it, and do the same with blacking, and yellowing, and yellowing, and other things until it is completely gone.</start_of_turn
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If, therefore, anything is to be removed from the beginning of the matter by reason, it is well; and if not, repeat the process over the matter by reason on another day, the second day, and the third day, until the study has reached the end of the matter which you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	Know that teeth need various rasps of different forms, many figures: according to the preparation of your operation: because the rasp which bites from the lower part is different from the one which bites between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	These forms of rasps are with you prepared, which you wish.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	About the extraction of the tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary to treat the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity, and then to eradicate it
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	It is not in its power to remove it when it is sublimed: because it is a sublime substance: except when there is no excuse for removing it, then it is necessary to compel the patient to eradicate it, in order to strengthen him, and to confirm to you the painful tooth
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many indeed suffer from the patient's pain, and suppose that it is in the tooth itself and eradicates it: then the pain does not cease, until the painful tooth itself is eradicated
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We indeed go from the operation of phlebotomy to this.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When it is confirmed to you that the painful tooth itself is present, then you must sacrifice around the tooth with sponges, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is separated from all sides: then move the tooth with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first slowly, until you have fractured it
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place at that place in the forceps a good large size, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have held firmly, so that it does not move: then draw out the tooth according to its direction, so that you do not break it
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not go out, then take some of those instruments and introduce it inside from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at the beginning.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If it is tightly closed, either pierced or rotted: then you must fill that hole with a cloth: and string it with a fine thread, so that it does not break in the time of your constriction over it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you must pay attention, when you perform the incision around the circumference of the limb from all sides much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so that you do not break it, and remain over it until the greater part of it has gone out of that evil which is causing you pain from the beginning.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, do not do what the phlebotomists do in their frenzy, and audacity in their attempt to eradicate it, except as we have directed.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many indeed make them worse upon men with great illnesses, of which some are more difficult to break, and leave all the roots of it, or take out some of them along with some teeth of the jaw: as we have often seen
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be joined after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	And if blood flows from the place (for many indeed blood flows from it) then take hold of something with your hand, and put it over that place: and if not, cauterize it if it does not suffice to close the wound.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the fine forceps which you will use when you move the tooth in the beginning, should be long-handled, with short handles, large, so that they do not bend when pressure is applied to them with the hand: they should be like large nails, until when you string them with the tooth, they do not break themselves, neither do they bend: short handles, and they should be made of iron or of hammered copper, directed at the extremes: and in their extremes there should be teeth, some of which enter into some of them, and string them with a moderate tension, strong
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when extremities resemble the shape of an eagle's beak, which is called a ciconia, there are strong constrictions.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Concerning the extirpation of teeth and the extraction of fractured mandibles.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 1
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains in the vicinity of erasure a tooth which has fractured something, then one must place butter over the root for one or two days until the place has softened: then introduce into the cavity the ligature or forceps whose extremities resemble the shape of an eagle's beak, which is called a ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of these forceps is as follows
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like a file or like a chisel
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, they do not obey you at the extraction with these forceps, then you must place a hook over the root and remove all the flesh, and introduce the small hook, whose form is as follows
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Have short extremities, but large heads: and do not immerse them, lest they break
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If the root comes out through that, that is good: and if not, one must try with other instruments whose form is the same
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangle of the extremities, in which there is some thickness
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the thin triangle of the extremities
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also used with this instrument which has two branches, whose form is as follows
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and materials which are appropriate for teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And be careful with this instrument which assimilates a large stone, of this form, triangular extremities twisted, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break: and do not immerse it
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that the instruments for teeth are many: and like the rest of the instruments they do not all work in the same way. And a skilled artificer, knowing his art well, finds by himself the right instrument for each operation and its related ailments.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For since the ailments from which these latter instruments are useful are diverse, the ancients did not speak of a single instrument for all of them
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, the jawbone is fractured from the teeth or from any other bones of the jaw, or if it becomes putrid: then it is necessary to consider the location of the fracture in relation to the instruments and forceps which were mentioned in the extraction of roots, and to use them with skill, since their form is such.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	If there is something of size which hangs between the teeth and the bone, so that it cannot be drawn out without tension, or if it is retained with the bone and does not slip away, until the tooth is extracted: and restore the place with the physicians who are present
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then remove it from the putrefaction and care for it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	About the closure of teeth that protrude over others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter two.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude abnormally from their natural course, a wound is caused thereby: and especially when this happens in women and girls, because of their soft gums
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is therefore necessary to consider this
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth has grown after another tooth and is not aligned, or if it is possible to suture or file it: then extract it. And if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, which has this shape
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is like a small knife made of iron, with acute ends and a wide blade
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such that which you make on many days, and by reason of the hardness of the tooth, and that it does not move another from the teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, the exposed edge of the limature is prominent: then limate that with a file which has a form like this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let all be from the handle, and the thumb of your hand be smaller than the other fingers, like a file which is made for needles: with which you may gradually file the tooth in many days with ease, that it does not move, and falls out: then soften it, and finish it off with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If there is a tooth from which a part is broken off, and which is causing the tongue to bleed: then it is necessary to file it also, until the sharpness of that fracture is removed, and it is evened out: and flattened, so that it does not bleed, nor corrupt the speech
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Of the reposition of teeth with files.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When it happens that the front teeth are fractured and shaken by a blow, or in a case: and the patient is not able to bite properly because of that: then it is necessary to restore them with gold wire: for silver quickly tarnishes and becomes putrid after a few days: but gold never changes
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the middle wire be in thickness and breadth according to the quantity which it takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the reposition is that you take the wire, and introduce its double between two healthy teeth: then you shall weave with two extremities of the wire between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you have fixed it to the healthy tooth on the other side
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then proceed with the texture until you reach the part from which you began: and keep your hand steady with skill and wisdom until it ceases to move forward: and make your constriction firm as you bind the thread at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the surplus thread with scissors: and gather each [end] together, and bind them together with the thumb: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue: then let go of the tight thread when it remains
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it is dissolved or broken, string it with another thread, and keep it firm as before for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	This is the form of the tooth, and the figure of the rotation of two healthy teeth and two moved teeth, as with water
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it is done, that one tooth or two after falling out remain in their places, and return as we have said, and remain: and this does not happen except by a skillful, prudent, and experienced artist
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when some of the bones or pieces of bone are adjusted: and it is made like the shape of a tooth, and is placed in the place from which the tooth is extracted and bound, as we have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Of the incision of the ligament that happens under the tongue, and which hinders speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When this ligament which happens under the tongue is cut, it is either natural, as it is born with man, or accidental, from an injury which has consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in this is, that you open the bone of the patient in his head in your hand, and elevate his tongue: then cut through that ligament nerve across the width, until the tongue is freed from its retention
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there be in that anything of hardness and swelling, and if that arise from the consolidation of a wound: then project into that area the hook, and find that by its breadth, until you cut through the ligament, and the swelling shall be resolved.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Take heed, that there be no deep wound, and cut through the artery there, and the blood flow shall be restored.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then shall be laid upon the mark of the incision with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a bandage of linen, which shall hold the patient at night: that it may not consolidate on the second day.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however there arise blood flow, then place upon the place a dry sponge.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If however it boils over with blood, then cauterize the place with a mild cautery, which shall suffice for that: then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it be healed
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Of the extraction of the ranula which is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When there happens under the tongue a swelling which assimilates a small ranula, which hinders the tongue from its natural operation: and perhaps it grows so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in that is, that you open the mouth of the patient before the sun: and consider the swelling
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a dark or red color, hard, which does not yield to the patient's sense: then do not touch it, for it is cancer
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it inclines towards white, in which there is moisture, then project into that area the hook, and cut into it with a fine needle, and free it from all sides
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood should spill during thy operation at the hour of its occurrence, then place upon it a dry sponge, until the blood is severed: thereafter return to thy operation, until thou hast extracted it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	And bandage it with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest of the treatment suitable for this, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the treatment of the two amygdals.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When the gods of the guttur region become excited, that is, the glands which resemble almonds, which arise outside: and which are called the two amygdals: when you treat them as we mentioned in the previous discourse, and they do not heal, then consider them
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If there is a hard abscess, of a brown colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red in colour, and its root is large: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather let it go by itself, until it matures
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will perforate it, or it will rupture by itself
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in colour, round, and its root is thin: then you must cut it open
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in this is as follows: if the abscess has calmed down completely or if any diminution has appeared: then do sit the patient with his face towards the sun: and place his head in your lap: and open the opening of the abscess with an instrument, and grasp the tongue with your hands, and draw it downwards with the instrument.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Use silver or air, which is subtle like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When the thing is thus with me, and the limb is shown to you, and its bone protrudes above the skin of its part: then grasp the hook, and fix it in the substance, and draw it out as much as possible, except that you draw out with it something from the skin.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut the skin with the instrument which has this form which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is like scissors: truly their extremities are bent back, so that the opening of each one is at a right angle to the other: where care must be taken lest it be burned or wet with blood.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut with the spatula, which has this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Be acute from one part, not acute from the other part.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut through one substance, cut the other according to this same kind of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there should arise bleeding, he should gargle with water in which poppy heads are boiled: or leaves of myrtle, and things like these from sponges: until the bleeding is stopped. Then care for him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when there are shown to be other bones in the gullet besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut these in the same way as the two tonsils were cut.</start_of_turn>
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have cured a woman from a bone that was born in her gullet, which pulled at the flesh, with little sense, because it was pressing on the gullet: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and I forbade her eating and drinking water: and she died within one or two days.</start_of_turn>
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	The afterbirth will ascend as far as it emitted two branches, until it passes beyond the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	The afterbirth will therefore be fixed in one hook
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then draw it out, and from it is the greater part
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut it off where it comes out of the nostrils
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then do the same with the other nostril that was left behind
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then open its mouth and press its tongue: and afterwards fix the hook in the afterbirth: then cut off from it the part of it which does not go away with the blood; for the greatest part of the woman's gut has gone away, and she immediately begins to drink water, and then accepts food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	It does not cease to cut from that afterbirth many times: and the afterbirth follows in the place of that which we cut out, until it is prolonged and becomes like it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I did it like that, and cauterized the afterbirth between the gut
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It remained in addition: then I went away from that place, and I do not know what God did with it after me
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of the afterbirth of a woman
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 7.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the mucus descends to the woman, and the afterbirth is prolonged and is long: then it is called perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part large and round, then it is called a woman.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with that which we said in the discourse, and the cure does not suffice: and you see that the afterbirth is soft and quiet from it: then it is necessary to cut it off
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And whatever is rounded in it and has no length, and is either blood-stained, or of a tawny or black colour, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to make an incision of it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	And in it there is fear over the diseased part.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore when you are dealing with it according to the method which I have mentioned from its whiteness and its length, so that you make the diseased part rest upon the sole: and you clamp its tongue with an instrument, as I have mentioned previously concerning the nail: then fix the loop in one, and draw it downwards: and cut it through with one of the two instruments which I mentioned for the incision of two finger-nails.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut through it except that which adds to its natural limit without addition
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut through it more, you will cause damage to the bowels and the flesh.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use that which we mentioned concerning the incision of two finger-nails: and take care of it, until it is healed
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the diseased part returns from the incision: then it is necessary that you use ingenuity in its cauterization without fear and haste.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in it is not except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the diseased part in your palm.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then clamp its tongue with the instrument which we mentioned previously concerning the nail.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I mentioned previously concerning cauterization and mix it with burnt lime, and put it on it neither thick nor thin, and touch it with the concave side of this instrument
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	So that its extremities which are placed where the medicine is concaved, are like the concave side of the cochlea of a radius
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	Place the instrument with the medicine upon the abdomen itself: and let the patient lie upon his side, so that the moisture from his mouth may flow inwards from the medicine, and not descend downwards into his gut, and cause him pain.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.</start_of_turn>
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And from the first touch over the abdomen for the quantity of half an hour, until you see it has become softened, and rest the biting of the medicine.</start_of_turn>
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take hold of the limb, and cover it with the medicine over the end of the radius, and inflate the limb with medicine, and pass the radius into the cannula from above, until the limb adheres to the abdomen.</start_of_turn
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you follow that you wish to perform cautery on the vein.</start_of_turn
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then remove the medicine: for it itself will dry and fall away in three days, or four.</start_of_turn
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	And if you find that the medicine has not digested as you wished, repeat it: and after the cautery, remove the surrounding fat of the vein with the coto, and bathe with butter, and rub with it what is around it from the medicine: and cool with cold water.</start_of_turn
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And care for the outside with embroidery, and for the inside with gargles, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Thus is this kind of treatment safer than incision and longer lasting in respect of fear.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when the abdomen is healed even with the thing which is finer than cautery and incision: it is healed with fumigation, according to this method.</start_of_turn
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamine, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sassafras, and chamomile, and bitter herbs: and mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil: and the pot should be covered with a lid: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which the instrument is composed according to this method.</start_of_turn
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let air or water issue forth: and let the extremity be introduced into that which contains the pomegranate, until the vapor rises up to the upper lip of the cannula, until the upper lip is obscured much.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over the much, until it boils over.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	Take heed, lest thou perform this treatment at the outset of an apostematic attack.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Better add some of the [substance] in the apostemate: and it is not necessary that thou do this except when the apostematic heat has subsided
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If, however, this instrument be not at hand, then take a cannula and apply to its extremity some bark of acacia: that it be not burned: for the bark of acacia hinders the vapor from burning the bone: and this is an excellent cure with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the jaw
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	There adhere much of bone in the gut, or fish-spine, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore that thou extract what appears above that which falls down into the groove, after thou hast placed the tongue with the instrument near the jaw, and hast declared that it is in the gut
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And that which is not apparent to thee and is hidden in the gut, it is necessary that thou make the patient vomit before any food is eaten in the stomach
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps also the thing that is attached will issue out by vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the patient may swallow down a piece of chaff, or the radix of liquorice, or a dry piece of bread: or take a dry sponge of marine sponge and bind it up in thread, then swallow it down.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it is necessary to reach the place where bones or spines are, and they are extracted, then it proceeds outwards.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not go outwards as we have said: then use an instrument of lead in this fashion.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the Radius parumper, and at its extremity there shall be a curve which intrudes into its guttur with ease: and it shall have its head elevated upwards
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And beware of its contact with the epiglottis, that it does not cause it to swell, and drive forward with it the bone, or the spine, or the doctor himself must intervene with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	However the sick person intrudes it, that is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the annexed thing: and he drives downwards, or pulls his hand upwards with the instrument, the whole thing according to the quantity which is prepared for it, until it departs
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Of the extraction of the blood vessel
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the bleeding vessel is treated with what was said in the discourse on treatment by the doctors, and it does not cease, then consider in the guttur of the patient in front of the sole, or behind the tongue after you have moved the tongue with the instrument which I mentioned before.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your hand should slip upon the bleeding vessel, grasp it with a small hook, or with fine fingers in the middle.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If this is not possible with these: then take a curved needle, and insert it into the guttur of the patient until close to the guttur: then insert the needle with the burning iron into the curvature of the needle.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this often: and the patient abstain from all water throughout the day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he shall take a full measure of cold water and open his mouth wide: and he shall gather his jaw with it, and he shall not swallow anything from it: and he shall drink the water an hour after the other with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	The blood-sucker will be overcome when he feels the water falling from his mouth.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If, however, he does not depart from this as we have said, then he must suffocate the patient with sponges or with a towel or other instrument as we have mentioned in the suffocations of the nose or ear
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for the thing itself will fall down.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the mode of operation in suffocating is that you take all the bones in which there are joints with fire: and the container is covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and the instrument is made to issue from that hole
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then he will throw away the suffocating, and put the patient's jaw in the extremity of the tube, and close his jaw, so that he does not escape the suffocating, until you know that the suffocating has passed to the blood-sucker
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood-sucker immediately falls down.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall down, then repeat the suffocating many times
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the patient will endure sitting, and will eat onions and garlic, and will not drink water
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that he depart from this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the blood-sucker is extracted from the gut when it falls upon the vomit.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like tweezers, like bones: except that it has that curve which enters the gut
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is like the wing of an eagle called a ciconia, in which there is a roughness of the lime: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	And concerning the opening of abscesses, and their cutting, and their care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.</start_of_turn>
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	Abcesses are of many kinds, with many variations, according to the nature of the recollection of each: and they are diverse in their perforation and their cutting into two modes.</start_of_turn>
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of these kinds of abscess is that which proceeds from moisture.</start_of_turn
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The other kind is that which arises from the body itself.</start_of_turn
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess arises in the head, it is another thing from an abscess which happens in the belly: and an abscess which arises in a fleshy part is another thing from an abscess which arises in joints: and each one of these has its own judgment concerning the operation.</start_of_turn
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And concerning abscesses there are those which must not be perforated until after the completion of the healing in the flesh, and the completion of their complement: and there are those which must be perforated while they are raw, and do not heal according to their complement.</start_of_turn
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	For example, abscesses which are close to joints.</start_of_turn
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For an abscess which arises near a joint and which lasts a long time may cause the ligament or nerve of that joint to become corrupted: which is the cause of the contraction of that limb.</start_of_turn
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or an abscess in a principal limb: for if you delay its perforation until it heals, the bone will decay or become fractured, or through that limb itself.</start_of_turn
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	If it is near the anus, perforate it immediately: and it is not fitting to perforate a stool that is not completely digested, except if it is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply and extend inwards of the rectum, and make a fistula, or remain unhealed at its end.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary to know the time of perforation of the stool, which is mature according to completion: and it is beside sedation of pain, recession of fever, and decrease of redness, and pulse, and severity of the headache of the stool: and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	It is necessary to make the perforation in a lower place of the stool, and more cautiously: and let the perforation be wide in length of the body, if the stools are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of tears, and strings, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all the places where there is no reflection
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	However, in those which reflect, be cautious with the perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When indeed the stool is in the place of carnis: then it is better to omit the perforation of it, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.</start_of_turn>
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, the course of the fever is prolonged, and there is much pain and distress, and perhaps the lips of it will be prolonged, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some stools are perforated according to the breadth of the body by necessity: or according to that which the limb demands.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary to administer in small stools a moderate perforation, and in large stools a wide perforation: or many sections alike in the magnitude of the stool.</start_of_turn>
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are from the apostemata, in which it is necessary that the skin should be concaved: and it occurs when it has been made like a piece of cloth, and has been made at the end, when it is dead: as it happens with many things, as with a dubelet and a bubon.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are from those which are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there are also those from which it occurs like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As the apostema of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are also those in which an round section and a lunar section are administered: and similar things are from sections
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	This, however, which has no head, such as are the superficial lenia apostemata, requires that it be pierced through with a superficial perforation, or simply flattened out
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the apostema is thick and has collected much blood, to pierce it through, so that it does not swell up and extract all the pus at once: rather extract from it a part of it immediately
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then oil the apostema until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the degree, until it is expelled: especially if the patient is weak in spirit, or a woman in childbirth, or a young child, or an old man decrepitus: for the spirit of the animal is resolved from the animal with the evacuation of the blood: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore take great care with this chapter
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have pierced the apostema, which you must do, you must remove the wool: and consider
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If there is a small abscess of the apostematis, either perform a plane section or administer lead from an old container.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	If there is a large abscess and many holes of perforation exist, it is necessary then to introduce into every hole a quantity of lead until they reach the innermost parts.</start_of_turn>
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	If in the abscess you have excised a piece of skin, or have cauterized around it: then it is necessary to apply an old container of lead, or like when a piece of flesh is taken out, or to smear it with wool without moisture: and bind it until the third day.</start_of_turn>
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it and care for it with the unguents until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however blood flow occurs in your operation at the hour: then administer cold water and vinegar, after having swallowed it on a piece of bread: and place it over the place of blood flow several times.</start_of_turn>
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer regimen, care, and powders, which I have mentioned in many places of this book, and from experience.</start_of_turn>
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is in winter and the place of the abscess is filled with many nerves: then it is necessary to instill coarse barley with wine and mustard seeds: and place them over the place.</start_of_turn
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer and the place is fleshy: then it is necessary to place barley soaked in water, and mustard seeds, or them with wine and mustard, and all cold.</start_of_turn>
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until then, as we have said, on the third day remove the abscess, wash it out, and administer in its care what is appropriate until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is indeed necessary from the knowledge of the cure for all after-effects.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the nature of each case, as I have said concerning every after-effect, how it is possible to cure it is set out in detail individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the excision of after-effects which occur in the head
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small after-effects occur in the head and are of the kind of knots which contain tunics, which are like little sacks: as if they were chickens' eggs
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	There are many kinds of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some are solid: some contain moisture like slime: some contain moisture like blood clots and pus: and some are like stones
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the excision of all, and in their extraction, there is no fear, as long as during their excision it does not damage the arteries.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their excision is like that of these instruments, which are named after their shape which comes afterwards, until you know what it contains
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then dry it out by the superficial section: by this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	Begin by making an incision from point b to point g. When the moisture has been evacuated, then remove the knot which contains it, and do not leave any residue behind
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	There are many of these which remain if anything is left behind
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the wound in Egyptian unguent, if there is any: or in water and salt: and press with a sponge, and leave it until tomorrow.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	The wound itself eats away what remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Repeat the procedure above the wound with the second and third layers, and if you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then care for the wound with ointment until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If there is a fat node remaining: then dry it out in this way, making a section in the shape of a cross: and draw out the nerves between the two lobes of the section, and remove it from every side: and make an effort to extract the membrane which contains it.</start_of_turn>
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, you meet with resistance from an artery, then do as I shall tell you later.</start_of_turn
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	Proceed in the same way with a stone abscess, by section and treatment as before.</start_of_turn
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	The section of a stone abscess is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.</start_of_turn>
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some head abscesses in certain people, in which there is no moisture at all.</start_of_turn
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I dried out the abscess on the head of a maidservant, and I found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough and white, which could not be broken: and if I pierced it with anything, it would wound it.</start_of_turn
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses which happen on the head, except for those which happen in the heads of children and near the roots of the ears, the section should be superficial.</start_of_turn
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make the perforation always from the lower part upwards, so as to help the discharge of the pus downwards.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for that which is fitting for them from the care.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Then care for that which is fitting for them from the care of the throat parts.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.</start_of_turn>
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Many of these wounds happen in the throat, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes also in other parts of the body.</start_of_turn>
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above all those which happen in the throat, there are some which are one, and many: and they are all generated from one source: and every Strophula is inside its own tunic, like in the nodes and the wounds of the head, as we have mentioned.</start_of_turn
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the species of these wounds are many.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from these there are fat ones: and there are those which hold moisture: and there are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.</start_of_turn
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In this way, when a good-dispositioned liquid is applied to the touch, whose mark is its proximity to the colour of the skin, and which moves to every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the throat, neither to the gullet, nor to the artery, nor is it deep: it must be cut from the surface downwards from the upper part to the lower part of the body from the line A to the line G, and the two edges of the skin should be spread out with a single finger, or with many fingers if necessary, as we said concerning the wounds of the head, and the contents should be extracted gradually.</start_of_turn
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is necessary to be cautious that no bone, or nerve, is injured.</start_of_turn
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the sponge be neither too acute nor too blunt: so as not to add your hand to the incision, or to frighten the patient, and to cut more than is necessary.</start_of_turn
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If however you cut a vein, or an artery, or are forbidden by the operation, then put in the wound a piece of lead, or some powders which exude blood, and tighten the wound, and let it go until the pain subsides after the operation, and the wound is softened: or it will begin to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is expelled by tension. Redi therefore to your operation until you have completed it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger if anything remains of the other stitches: if so, cut them easily, and remove them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is in the root of the large stitch a great vein: then it is necessary that you do not cut that vein from its root: rather you must bind it with a doubled strong thread, and let it go until it falls down by itself without any dressing.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then apply to the wound the fat of an old man which you have immersed in Egyptian unguent.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole suture comes out, then it is necessary that you gather together the two lips of the wound: and hold them fast, after you have washed because otherwise some excess remains.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If however you wash because of the excess of the suture because of the size of the stitch, then it is necessary that you insert at the root of that to extract it: and administer the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what remains of the stitches must be moistened, perforate it with a superficial perforation: that its maturity may appear: and place the perforation below that which follows below the body, as we have said
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after the perforation lint with unguent, and like that, so that it consumes that which remains from the corruption, until when you wash the wound will be healed: then take care of the wound with the generation of flesh, until it is healed
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the section of the epiglottis from the apostemate inwards of the guttur by chance.
Caput XLIII.	On the section of the epiglottis from the apostemate inwards of the guttur by chance.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this section of the epiglottis is in the Epiglottis, and not in any land that I know of, who has made it: and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in the cases where there is a swelling, it is necessary to section the epiglottis: when it does not take effect: for all the veins and the lungs are sick
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	And in those who have a hard swelling in the mouth, or in the guttur, or in two amygdales, when there is no inflammation in the canal, it is necessary to section the epiglottis in order to escape from the destruction which comes from the protrusion
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary therefore, when we wish to do this, to section the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small section through the width, in that place where there is between two circles the quantity which is the section of the cartilage, not in the cartilage itself: and this place is convenient for the section, because it is deprived of flesh, and the blood vessels from it are long.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the guttur with a finger.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then find the skin, until it reaches the canal: there will be blood vessels if there is anything there.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then cut the cartilage which we have mentioned: and it is signified over the section of the canal by the phlegm which comes out of it, when it is broken, and the cutting of the vessel.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And withdraw the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the hour has passed in which the preparation is due, gather together the two lips of the wound and sew them together without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then apply medicines which cause the flesh to grow back, until such time as the wound is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Thus spoke Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	This is all that Albucasis has said concerning this matter; for when any of these hours have passed since the sickness began, the patient is already gone, and his breath is cut off: he cannot breathe through his mouth because of the wound, and he expires. Therefore they command that the wound be closed immediately, until the mischief of the disease has vanished, which is in three days, or nearly so; then indeed they order the wound to be sutured and the patient to be treated until he is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this, which I have seen myself, that a handmaid took a knife and put it into his gut, and it went into the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	I was called to care for him, and I found him already dead, just like a dead man
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I saw that he had been cut by the wound, and blood had flowed out of the wound from a wound that was not properly closed.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I am convinced that if it had not been for the wound itself, she would not have died, neither would she have been blind: the wind had escaped from the wound
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I treated her, closed the wound, and cared for her until she was healed: and the handmaid did not suffer anything further, except that she was spitting in the water: and she recovered after three days to a better state of health
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Henceforth, it is certain that there is no fear of the epiglottis being cut
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the section of the hernia gutturis.
Caput XLIIII.	On the section of the hernia gutturis.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This chapter is on the section of the hernia gutturis. It is a large hernia, according to the colour of the body, and is frequent in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	It is classified into two types: either natural or accidental
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	The natural hernia is certain not to have been caused by an injury
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental hernia is of two kinds: one is like a swelling of fat.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	The other is like an abscess which arises from the swelling of an artery
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this there is danger, and it is not right to assume that it is only a hernia because of its size: and you must examine it carefully and investigate it with an introspective examination.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If you find that it is like a swelling of fat and is not attached to any vessel: then you must dry it up like a swelling of fat and extract its contents, if it is within a sac: or if not, you must examine it thoroughly
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place where it was extracted until it is healed
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	The section of the super species of nodes
Caput XLV.	The section of the super species of nodes
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodes, and I have mentioned all of them in their order: and it is necessary to know the difference between a node and an extrusion, especially when there is doubt
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, therefore, that when an extrusion has become cold, and has lost its fever and its pain, until the ebullition of surplus has passed away and the putrefaction has ceased: then the fever and heat will subside
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the node is not hot, neither is the fever, neither the pain, and it contains within it a bladder of fat, which is its own sac, and is according to the colour of the body: and it is the beginning of their disease like chickpeas, and it makes like a bath, and is greater or less.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And there are two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colours of moisture are many, as I said in the explanation
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary therefore, when you approach the treatment of the Node, that you experience it, and inquire about it at first with the instrument which is called the Intromissum, according to the form which will be shown in the following chapter
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the way of inquiry after the swelling, and of all Nodes, is that you take hold of this instrument and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the swelling: and you withdraw your fingers gradually until you know that the instrument has pierced the skin
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then finally touch your hand according to the measure of the swelling
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider what comes out in its stain
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore it comes out running moisture, whatever the colour be: then dry it with a superficial section, according as I said in the other swellings
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if it does not come out moisture in the stain of the Intromissum, then you know that it is fatty: dry it therefore with a section having the shape of a cross, according to this shape: as I have taught you: and suspend it with threads, and rub the skin from every part with ease: and grasp the bladder if you can see it above that, so that you may extract it whole with the Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the bladder is ruptured during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, much of the time this occurs, then extract it broken, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if anything at all remains of it, either a little or a lot, it returns to the Node according to the most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it urges you, and something remains of it slightly: then make a wound at the end of your work, with some corrosive powders of needles: and bind the wound, and place above it what rests upon the soft swelling, and care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If there is a large Node, then two of its lips must be opened, and care for it with that which is within it.</start_of_turn>
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If, however, there is an opposing pulse either upward or downward: then stretch it out, and make an incision at the root of the hair, and release it tightly for two or three days, until the wound softens and the blood-boiling subsides: then return to the incision which remains of the Node.</start_of_turn>
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	About the instruments for cutting and perforating.</start_of_turn>
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.</start_of_turn>
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	These are the forms of the Instruments which are introduced, and there are three kinds.</start_of_turn
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	There are three kinds: the great, the medium, and the small.</start_of_turn
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be of iron, square-ended, with the center of the square removed, so that they may hasten the entrance into the swelling.</start_of_turn
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the Experiences, and no, that is, perforating: and one of them is called a beris, which is, a perforator, and there are three kinds.</start_of_turn
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From the great to the small, all things have their measure.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are all connected, as when we investigate through bones, and exits, and fistulas, and abscesses from what is between them
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And the rest are round, third, and flat, like a large needle which is guided under the skin, from citron, or from air, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	The best of them are those which arise from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And also from black lead, which join in that they may be experienced through fistulas, whose concavity reflects like reflections with their softness against these reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	There are three kinds of them.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because they are great, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the diameter of the fistula and the stricture of it
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	Shapes of vessels, and there are many kinds of them
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because they are simple, that is to say that they have only one curve: and there are three kinds like liquids, great, medium, and small
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from the bones are blind: and there are three kinds of them
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from the bones are needles having two curves, and there are three kinds of them: and from the bones are needles having three curves, and there are three kinds of them: and all of these are necessary in their place
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, which cut and scrape nodes and abscesses: and there are three kinds of them, because they are great, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities which make the cut are acute, the other extremities are not acute: and they are not put together like that, except when there is an attempt to make an incision in the nerves alongside the fear of cutting the veins, or to prevent infection from the abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magdae, and are three in number.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	These are Magdae, and are three in number.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the sponges which are driven between the fingers at the perforation of the apostematum: these are not perceived by the patient. There are three kinds, great, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The shape of the sponges which are driven between the fingers at the perforation of the apostematum: these are not perceived by the patient. There are three kinds, great, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be of air or citron, round, of equal length, somewhat like liquids: and be thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of sponges should be great and small: so that you can evacuate blood quickly when necessary, and then when it is not required by the physician
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	But do not use them for the evacuation of blood in any part of the body, and do not use them except in carbuncles: such as for wounds of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, belly, groin, and similar to these which are of carbuncles, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes other small things like sponges are used which are similar to the cortices of fists, according to their shape: with which blood is evacuated when it flows out of the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are of the round shape according to this form
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the care of the breasts of men which assimilate the milk of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of some men swell at the time of sleep (that is, when they begin to become soiled in sleep) until they become like the breasts of women: and they remain swollen with pus
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever dislikes this thing should cause the breast to be cut with a lunar section, according to this form from the line A to the line G. Then scrape away the fat all around
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	After that, let the patient be given a poultice from the medicament of incision.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join together two lips of the wound with suture, and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the nipple declines downwards, and is softened by its size, as is the case with women: then it is necessary to find two seams on the two upper sides of the wound, similar in size to a half-moon. Each one must be continued with the other at the end of each, until the larger line contains the smaller one, following this shape from the line b. to the line g. Then after that, scrape off the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said concerning the suture and powder, which is necessary for the cure, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not wish to complete the incision because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding: then you must apply a poultice soaked in corrosive unguent under the wound, and leave it until it has eaten away that which remains of the fat.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	As for the perforation of the apostematis, which happens under the nipple.</start_of_turn
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.</start_of_turn
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These apostemata which happen under the nipple are of the kind of hard Stropharia which contain vesicles, and from these are those which contain moisture.</start_of_turn
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Which are from the moist things which contain moisture, must be cut with a lunar section, following this shape from the line b. to the line g. when all that is in the apostemata from the blood has been evacuated, then apply a poultice to the old wound and leave it until another day.</start_of_turn
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the foot is raised up, and is cared for with an unguent suitable for it, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the swelling were from a kind of knot of the Strophular kind, then it should be cut above itself, as we said in the section on the Strophulas that are equal
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, pus extends from it in this way, then apply cautery to it, according to what has been said previously
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Concerning the section of the swelling that happens by the Artery and the Vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the Artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is consolidated, then much swelling often happens from the swelling: and in the same way, swelling also happens in the Vein, as it happens in this swelling and inflation
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the swelling and inflation are from the Artery and the Vein are these: for when the swelling is from the Artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body: and when you touch the swelling of the digits with your fingers, you feel as though there is a constriction
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is from the Vein is rounded in the appearance of the body
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section of this swelling is dangerous, especially when it is under the scrotum, and the groin, and the neck, and in many parts of the body: and it is great danger
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is necessary therefore that its care be taken with iron, and that from the outside also it is in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary that its care be taken
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Concerning this, therefore, that which is from the outside is from the swelling of the orifice of the Artery, find in the cutting of the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the part with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free the thing from the tunics, until it is detached.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce the hook under it and make the thing penetrate until the other side, and bind the artery with a double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temporal bones.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place which is between the two ligaments with the sponge, until the blood which is in it all comes out, and it is dissolved after the clot has gone away
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then carry out the treatment which brings on pus, until the ligaments are gone: afterwards care for it with suitable unguents until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If there should be a clot because of the section of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold your hand which is possible from the clot with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce the hook under the place where you held your hand, and make the thing penetrate: and be there a double thread, until you pull it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind with the clot the ligament with a strong thread: according to what I have told you about the ligation of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of the thread
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you wish to draw out the thread, then introduce another hook with another thread under the whole clot at the incision of the needle: before that, and bind your thread in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the clot in the middle of it, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut away the excess of the skin, and let go what is bound from it
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put over it a little powder which you submerged in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then carry out the treatment which is done with poultices and unguents, until it is healed
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Of the swelling which arises from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Of the swelling which arises from the twisting of nerves.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Like that which happens in the artery and vein, in the same way does it happen in the nerves: which happens by impact in the case of concussion, or by excessive work, or in like manner: and it happens most frequently in the armpits, or at the ankle, and in every place where there is a joint movement: and it is a serious swelling.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It is similar in colour to the rest of the body, and it is found in various positions without pain: and when it is squeezed with pressure, a faint sensation of numbness similar to that of drunkenness is felt in it
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	It is not a swelling which is accumulated in the depth of the body, but rather under the skin, and it is moved to every part, and does not go forward or backward or to the sides
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Which is caused by the impact in the joints, does not require that it be sutured with iron
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps in it there will be a contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, in that which is caused by the impact in the head, or in the face, find the skin with blisters.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small swelling, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from its root
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a thread, and scrape it off: then remove it, and mix gum with the suture: and care for it until it heals
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Of the section of the swelling which happens inside the body.
Caput LI.	Of the section of the swelling which happens inside the body
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	These happen to many people in various parts of their bodies, and in the rest of their body, the little things which are called Fungalia, because they are similar to fungi
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is slender, and their head is large, and their lips are closed.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And they are of small seed: and they are of the kind which grow tall
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	I saw a man who had two little things in his belly which were greater than the rest like other seeds: there was no difference between them, the root was white, the seeds were large, and their lips were closed, and they were moist from the inside always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I cut them open and found in the weight of one like X and eight ounces and in the other like six ounces. And the operation of their incision is as you consider, if the patient is moist, and the color of the little things is white, moist, slender root: then cut it with a broad spatula and there will be in your presence their caecum in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	A great deal of blood will be discharged at the section of it: be careful therefore if it incites you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the patient weak and timid from the incision with the iron, then take a leaden thread, made in the center, and string it with it like this: which is how we have said, and let it go in two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then put in the stricture of lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not cease to string the lead until it is completely split, and it falls away by itself without toil
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If the little things are large of the root, then in their incision there is something fearful and painful: especially that which is in the belly
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	It is indeed possible to cut through the middle of it
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for yourself until you are healed of the wound.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	Then take care of yourself until the wound is healed.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Until the wound is healed.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The swelling of the belly is caused by many diseases.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	It is caused by wounds of the intestines which are above the belly: or from the bursting of the intestines, as in other ruptures
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood which flows from a vein or from an artery, as has been said before
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from a compressed belly.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however the wound is of the intestines, and the fluid escapes: then the colour of the swelling is like that of the body: it is soft, without pain: and it appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is from bursting of the intestines, then the place of the wound is like that which we have mentioned, and the swelling is of various degrees
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you touch it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound like that: and it swells very much at the entrance of the bath, and there is great suffering
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If however it is due to humidity, it is soft: then it is not hidden when you touch it with your hand, neither does it tighten, nor does it cause pain
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	When it is due to blood, then it appears with these signs: the swelling is black like soot
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	When it is due to dead flesh: then the swelling is great, bulky, hard, and is like the quantity of one
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If indeed it is on account of excessive moisture, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that case is that you must consider immediately, if the prominence of the navel is on account of blood of an Artery or Vein, or moisture: then it is necessary that you abstain from its treatment.</start_of_turn>
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that case there is fear and danger, just as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of apostemata on account of an artery and vein.</start_of_turn>
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the prominence of the navel is on account of an intestine or a tumor: then it is necessary that you order the patient to take a breath, as long as he keeps taking a breath, and to remain standing extended.</start_of_turn
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with encasement in the circumference of the whole navel.</start_of_turn>
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to rest between your hands on his back.</start_of_turn
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a sponge of a broad width in the circumference of the navel over the place which you indicated with encasement.</start_of_turn
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the apostemata upwards, with a large hook.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind it firmly in the circumference with thread, or with a strong silk cord: and let the knot of the binding be firm.</start_of_turn
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the extended apostemata above the ligament.</start_of_turn
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find that it is grasped by the ligament: then pull out the encasement, and introduce a finger into it, and push the intestine inwards: and if you find a tumor, then grasp it with the hook, and cut off its excess.</start_of_turn
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, the artery or vein is opposed, surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles and pass through two strong threads: and pass two needles through the circumference which you made around the appendix in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then string the appendix in four places on the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place, until the extended flesh softens: and it will fall away by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and softens.</start_of_turn>
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself with what is necessary from the unguents, until you are healed.</start_of_turn
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	And if the navel cord is protruding from the flesh near the belly, or from moisture: then it is necessary to flatten the appendix, as we have said.</start_of_turn
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for yourself with what is necessary to solidify the place.</start_of_turn
¶ De cura CANCRI.	(The text continues with instructions on how to care for a cancer patient.)</start_of_turn>
Caput LIII.	(End of text)</start_of_turn>
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	As we have said in the discourse on the species of cancer, and how it is to be treated by physicians: and caution should be taken with it when treated with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we have said cancer is generated in the matrix, and its treatment should be cautious.</start_of_turn
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients have said that whenever cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as cancer that is in the breast, or in the thigh, and those that are like them, from the members located to be removed entirely: especially when it is just beginning small.</start_of_turn
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is old and great, it is not fitting to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	It is not right to approach it when it is old and great.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	A procedure in such a case, when it is situated as we have said, is to precede and evacuate the black bile somewhat.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if you find a phlebotomy with a clear swelling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Prepare the patient beforehand for the operation, in which it is placed with the procedure.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then project on the knots of the spleen that meet it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then retract it from all sides with the skin, according to the prescription, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it off too quickly, but rather express the place, and evacuate the thick blood as much as possible with your hands, or with whatever instruments are available
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however it makes the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein: then cauterize the vein, until the bleeding stops
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Of the care of hydrosis.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 14.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We are narrating in this section the varieties of hydrosis, and how water is accumulated: and the signs of each species, and the treatment with physicians
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And concerning that which is cured with iron, it is not except for one kind of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympanitis: neither in the case of acute hypospasm: for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you are treated and have not benefited from the medication, consider the cause of your ailment.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	If, after treatment, the ailment persists or worsens, consider the nature of the disease other than Hydropisis: for example, if there is a cough or diarrhea, or a solution of the intestines, or similar conditions; in such cases, do not administer iron medication, for fear of its harmful effects.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, the patient is vigorous or advanced in age, other than with pure Hydropisis, there is no reason to fear the disease: in such a case, the mode of treatment is to elevate the patient and express from his belly by pressing on his abdomen with your hands the fluid which has collected there.</start_of_turn>
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a sponge of thorns, according to this fashion.</start_of_turn
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Two acute parts, long, with acute extremities like a Sponge of Thorns.</start_of_turn
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Indeed, there is some shortness of breath which gradually passes away, so that you do not pass it with the operation until you have reached the intestines, and do not cause any damage to the intestines themselves.</start_of_turn
Deinde considera.	Consider carefully.</start_of_turn>
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	If the Hydropisis originates from the intestines, then you must lengthen the incision from the navel to a distance of three fingers below the navel.</start_of_turn
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If, on the other hand, the Hydropisis is caused by liver disease: then your incision should be on the left side from the navel to a distance of three fingers.</start_of_turn
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	If the cause is the spleen, then the incision should be on the right side: and it is not necessary to make the incision on the side where you wish to place the patient, so as not to cause additional discomfort.</start_of_turn
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then perforate with the instrument the whole of the skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into the cavity the instrument, and raise your hand with Spatumili between the skin, and scrape, as if you are scraping yourself: and be as much as you scrape, as much as the nail, or somewhat less.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then perforate the scrape, until Spatumili reaches the empty place: and that is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and introduce into the hole the instrument whose form this is.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a tube: it is made of silver, or of air, or of gold, flexible, thin: which has in its lower part a small hole, and in its sides are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its extremity is cut off, according to the fashion of the incision of a reed, like water: at the extremity of it is an armlet
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then itself immediately descends above the instrument, therefore it evacuates from the water in an hour the quantity medium
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the patient dies from the resolution of the spirit of his animal: or something happens to him which approaches to death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of his virtue, and according to what is signified to you by the dispositions of the patient from the virtue of his pulse, and from his condition
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	For, because it is retained immediately because of the skin which retains the hole which is above the scrape: of which I spoke, that you must perforate it according to the light of the mode.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Repeat the instrument on the other side if the patient can tolerate it: and extract the same quantity from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Repeat the procedure on the other side if the patient can tolerate it: and extract the same quantity from water without fear.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If the patient is in too much pain, and you discharge from water a great quantity: then care for him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in bath and sun, and expect above the seat: and care for him with physicians of renown, until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, and the spleen and the liver, after the water has been extracted, according to what I have said before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	As for the care of infants who are born with unperforated urinary tract locations, do this: ...
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When a child comes out of the womb of its mother, and its head is turned to the side, and its opening is not perforated, or is narrowed, or is in the wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	One must immediately perform an incision with a fine needle when such a child is born with an unperforated opening, in order to prevent its bursting with Spatumil.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put in the opening a small lead weight, and tie it off: and keep it for three days, or four
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When it wishes to urinate, move it around, and mix it together
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He whose opening is narrowed is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it becomes wide
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	If there is a hole in its unnatural place, it suffers.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	If there is a hole in a place where it should not be, it suffers.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	For in a place where it should not be, there is no generation, for the seed cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and this is a severe pain.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	The way to treat this is to support the sick person above his back
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the neck of the patient with your left hand, and with your right hand cut the head of the worm from its place at the groin, with a sharp knife or pointed spatula: just as if you were cutting a nail, or as if you were pulling out a thorn, so that half of the worm comes out like the head of the worm: and so that the hole is in the middle as it should be
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And take care that there be no blood flow during the operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Many times this happens to us
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Counter this by applying pressure with that which tears blood, and care for the wound, until it is healed
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Of the accidents which happen in the preparation of the testicles and the head of the worm, and the corruption, blackening, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LXVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Many times these things happen to the worm, and it is the elevation of the diseased tissue
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And among these there are some which are malignant, and some which are not malignant
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	The malignant ones you must suspend with a fine thread and cut through them, until you have severed them entirely
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place above the wound the submerged heel in unguent Egyptian.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound afterwards with fine unguent until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the wound is severe, having color like blood, then it is necessary to administer cauterium upon it after its incision and the surrounding area.</start_of_turn>
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the wound is in the vicinity of a testicle, not circumcised, and is part of the testicle which is within the scrotum and part of the testicle which is outside: then it is necessary to elevate the testicle which is within first until it is consolidated, and then care for the outside: for if you care for both simultaneously, the scrotum will be ruptured.</start_of_turn
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And sometimes also in testicles, black spots and corruption.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	It is necessary therefore that you drain away all that is swollen and that you wish to corrupt, or that is already corrupted.</start_of_turn
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then smear above it afterwards with honey which has been consumed with pounded wheat and powdered thyme leaves.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however blood flows there, then administer cauterium with lunar cauterium, in this fashion.</start_of_turn
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cauterium is useful in two positions simultaneously, namely for bleeding and for a wound which is corrupted.</start_of_turn
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of a worm is corroded and the whole is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary to introduce lead shot into the flesh of the penis, so that it may mix with the pus above the wound.</start_of_turn
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In adherence of the scrotum with the head of the testicle, and this adherence does not happen unless in the one in whom the testicle is sound, and does not require more than its circumsision: and when it happens through a wound or an abscess, it is necessary to remove the scrotum with closed sponges until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the testicle is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	When it is difficult to discern these things, then it is necessary to remove some of the skin from the head of the testicle and from the scrotum.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	For indeed, when the scrotum is subtle, it is perhaps perforated because of its slightness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the scrotum and the head of the testicle with a fine linen cloth which has been made wet in cold water, so that they do not adhere again
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	And care for them with vinegar until they are solidified.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the care of infants, and the treatment of an error from an accident
Caput LVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a complete solution like the rest of the wounds: indeed, when it is our operation, our will, and the nature of the child herself are in the matter, it is necessary that we sign in this operation for a better result, and to reduce the risk of recurrence.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore, that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have learned through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That I have found in my study a greater part of the physicians, and phlebotomists, who use circumcision for the purification of the blood, by cutting with the knife and the scissors: and they use the cautery, and ligature with thread, and incision with the nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	I too have tried all these methods, and I have not found any better than the use of forceps and ligature with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in excision with a needle, the skin flees much
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin has two layers of cover: so sometimes the upper skin is cut through, and the lower layer is threatened: it is therefore necessary to make an incision to cut through the other, and to stop the pain of the future
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the excision is made by the cutting of the nails, as the barbers do, the incision of the extremity of the limb is not secured: for perhaps it penetrates the hole of it
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in excision with a nail, perhaps the iron will go through, and will corrupt your work: and the skin of a child is short in nature, and many are produced in this way, which does not suffice for excision: and I advise you of this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But as for excision with forceps, and ligature with thread, I have found it to be a good experiment: for the forceps are proportional to the incision: so that the greater the height of the former, the greater is the height of the latter.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you handle your hand, the two heights are proportional, and they are cut together in the course of one operation: and there is a similar compression of the figure, containing the skin of the limb from all sides, so that no error occurs at all
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of performing the operation is to make the incision, especially with children, if there is one who understands the matter, for you will not do it unless you ligate the thread in the limb itself: and dismiss him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that you can, from that which he receives understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands, prepared to a normal stance, and do not sit: and conceal the instruments in your sleeve or under your foot, so that no one shall see them at all, neither any instrument.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into the wound, and blow into the skin, and draw it upwards until the head of the wound emerges
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then drain away from it whatever has collected in that cavity
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then suture the marked place with two threads.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then suture the lower part with the nearby ligament next to it.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then take hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament firmly, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then raise the skin upwards quickly, and pull out the head of the wound
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better) and put on powder: and over the powder put a bandage in which the swelling has occurred or is being boiled in rose-water, pounded with fresh rose oil: and leave it on until another day: and care for the rest of the cure until he is healed
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the instrument for draining this is like this
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There are two handles at the ends, and two blades: do not let the handle escape from the wound: and let the length of the two blades be equal to the length of two thumbs together
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The mistake which often happens in draining is that perhaps the entire intrinsic skin has escaped, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore one must stretch out your hand from your hour with your finger before the closing of the place: and cut according to equality
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you are unable to hold the limb with your thumb, then extract it with the index finger and cut it off.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If it remains swollen for three days, and the swelling persists beneath the nail, the nail has become loose: then remove it until the nail becomes firm again, and scrape it off easily, and cut it off as before: and beware of the nail from the head of the fingerbone.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Treat it as we have said concerning the consolidation of bones from fragments: and even if it breaks through the skin above the measure, and goes up towards the upper parts, it will not harm it.</start_of_turn>
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Treat it as we have said until it heals.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of a retained bone in a wound.</start_of_turn>
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.</start_of_turn
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder may be caused by a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh which has grown, or by other things of that kind which we have mentioned in the section on treatment for inflammation.</start_of_turn
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	If the urine is not cured, and the retention is known to be caused by a stone which is in the neck of the bladder: then it must be supported over the knee.</start_of_turn
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then put their feet on their buttocks, and stretch out their belly from the upper part of their back, and bind the painful part as tightly as possible for them.</start_of_turn
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is thought that thus the stone in the neck of the bladder will be forced backwards: thereby the urine will be expelled.</start_of_turn
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If the ailment persists despite our previous treatment, and if the condition is grave, it is necessary to perform an extraction using an instrument called a siringa. It is fashioned from silver, is slight, flexible, and bell-shaped like the quill of a bird in the thickness of a radius. It is long like half of a palm. There is a fine cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	The manner of extracting the [disease] through the siringa is as follows: take a doubled thread and bind it at its extremity with lanolin or cotton, a secure ligature. Insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the siringa. Incise with scissors if anything protrudes from the lanolin, but truly insert the thread into the cannula with care, like an arrow.</start_of_turn>
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then soak the siringa with oil, butter, and alum. Place the patient on a seat and support the limb, and grasp the vein with your hand, and instill oil with the fingers, and olive oil and warm water.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the siringa into the vein with ease, until it reaches the root of the vein.</start_of_turn>
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double the upper part from the navel.</start_of_turn
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the siringa into the vein until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient know when the vein has been successfully pierced: do not do this without cause, except when the vein is twisted.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then gradually pull out the thread with the lanolin.</start_of_turn
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The vein will follow the lanolin.</start_of_turn>
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then withdraw the siringa and cause the vein to flow through the urine. Repeat the process of inserting and withdrawing the siringa until the vein is empty and the patient experiences relief.</start_of_turn>
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of clisterization with Clepshydra.
Caput LIX.	Concerning the quality of clisterization with Clepshydra.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or the blood therein is frozen, or congealed into pus, and the urine is distilled into water and medicines: then it is done with an instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is blunt, that is, closed
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And there are three holes in it, two from one side and one from the other side, like urine
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	The boiling place, in which that which drives it is located, should be according to the quantity that it is desired to drive without addition, until when it is drawn with it something is attracted from the humilities: and when it is driven, when it is expelled far off: according to that which does the Clepshydra, which ejects pitch, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When thus it is desired to eject humilities into the bladder, insert the extremity of the Clepshydra into the moisture, and draw it with that which drives it upwards, the moisture is thereby drawn into the concavity of the Clepshydra
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its extremity into the urine, as we have said in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive the moisture with that which drives it and immediately the moisture goes to the bladder, as the sick person feels
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of the gentle clister which is made for the bladder
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	It is made from silver, or gold: whose head is higher like a small bowl, and under that there is a space between which the ligament passes
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a goat, and put in it the moisture with which one wants to clisterize the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind the two sinuses together with a strong ligature using a double thread: and heat it with moderate heat above the flame.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the extremity of the bladder into the wound, afterwards string your hand over the vessel with tight moisture, until the patient feels that the moisture has already reached the vessel
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, the vessel is not present, then grasp a fragment of gut and form a circle from it, and perforate it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert the strong thread firmly through those holes, as they are wont to twist around each other.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as is done with a sausage: after you have placed in it what you wish of moisture, and oil, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind it in the instrument: and make with it as you made with the vessel from expressing with your hand, until the moisture has reached the vessel.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On the Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken in the discourse concerning the species of Stone, and its treatment by physicians: and we have spoken of the difference between the Stone generated in solids and the vessel, and the signs of the whole: and we have spoken of the Stone in which the operation is performed with the hand and section: and this is the Stone generated in the vessel itself: and that which forms in the wound: and I shall speak of this with manifest explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say, therefore, that the Stone generated in the vessel most often occurs in children
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is known that the urine comes out of the vessel like water in its substance: and there appears in it white sand, and the patient rubs his wound, and works with it, and is often fainting
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it arises, and goes out with it the anus among many things.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	It is easy to heal the children from this, until fourteen years have passed from that time.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	It is difficult in old age.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in youth it is middle, in which is between these two things: and its cure is easier because of its greater hardness: and if it is small, its cure is more economical
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the treatment, it is necessary in the first place to loosen the sick person with a cathartic, which will evacuate all the stool that is in their intestines: for this is often withheld at the inquiry of the stone
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the sick person is taken with their feet and is beaten, and moved downwards: so that the stone will go down to the bottom of the bladder, or will go out of its high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then let them sit down between your hands prepared, and your hands under their buttocks, so that the bladder will be completely tilted downwards
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then ask them, and touch them externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel the stone in the space, then act immediately with a section above it
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must withdraw the index finger with the left hand if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if he is an adult: and introduce it into their rectum, and inquire about the stone, until it is under your finger: and gently push it up to the neck of the bladder
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press above it with your finger, and push it outwards against the place where the section is to be made: and command the minister to grasp the bladder with his hand, and command another minister to extend the testicles of his right hand upwards: and another hand to move the skin which is under the testicles in the part at the place of the section
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the sponge into the wound, which is of this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	Then insert the sponge into the wound, which is of this shape. Find in it what is between the uterus and the testicles, and not in the middle, on the left side of the navel: and let the incision be above the highest stone, and your finger be in the rectum: and make a transverse incision, so that the external incision is wide and the internal incision is narrow, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to escape from it.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger which is in the rectum will press the stone at the incision and it will come out without difficulty
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that the stone has angles and margins, because of which its exit is difficult
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is soft, like a gland, and round: and its exit is easy
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	To it therefore which has angles and margins, add in the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out thus, then you must understand above the highest: or that you bind above it with a handle which has an extremity like the Moon, which binds above the stone, and does not yield to it: or that you insert under it an instrument which is flexible at its extremity
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If however you are unable above all, then enlarge the opening nearby
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If anything bloodstained comes to you, cut it off with a saw.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there is more than one stone, then drive in the first one towards the os vesiculae
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then drive in the small things afterwards: and do the same if there are more than two
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is a large one, then you do not know how to cut above it with a large incision
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Whenever a sick person is afflicted with two evils, either he must die, or he undergoes an excessive retention of urine: because neither of these two things finds rest in its place.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	In truth, one must administer the evacuation of the urine until it departs: or it is necessary to effect a fracture of its [bladder] with forceps, until it is extruded frustrated.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then apply a sponge of wool, aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it tightly, and put upon it a soaked bandage of oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water: so that the swelling will subside.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then rest the patient upon his side, and do not loosen the ligamentum until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, bathe the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents of diaphinium and balsam until it is healed
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If, however, in the wound there is a soft swelling added, and corrosion, and similar things: thus also if blood is congealed in the bladder and is prohibited from passing urine: this is recognized by the emission of blood with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Introduce your finger into the wound and extract the clot of blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it promotes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply everything that suits the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the course of treatment at all times to bind up the two thighs, and to compress, because of the medicines which are placed upon the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and lies in the urine tract and projects therein, and hinders the discharge of urine: then treat it with that which I have mentioned before until you reach the section.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	You are exempt from section in this treatment, for I have proved it to be useful.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is that you take a hook of iron, which has this form, triangular at the extremities, acute, fixed in wood.</start_of_turn>
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take thread, and bind it with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the perforating hook into the bladder with ease, until it reaches the stone: and withdraw the hook gradually from the stone: and make a hole in it from the other side.</start_of_turn
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	The urine will immediately cease.</start_of_turn>
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand over that which remains of the stone from the outside of the bladder.</start_of_turn
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It will break itself, and go out with the urine, and the patient will be healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If, however, you do not prepare this treatment for him, because of something that hinders it: then bind thread under the stone, and thread above the stone.</start_of_turn
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry over the stone in the urine between two ligatures.</start_of_turn
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.</start_of_turn>
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the ligature, and staunch the bleeding that occurs in the wound.</start_of_turn
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to ligate the thread under the stone, except that it does not return to the bladder: and to ligate the other thread above, except when you loosen the thread after the stone has gone, that the skin should return to its place, and that the wound should be closed: and for this reason it is necessary for you to ligate the upper thread, so that you elevate the skin to the top, so that the skin returns to its original position, and that the wound is closed.</start_of_turn
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of the stone from women.
Caput LXI.	On the extraction of the stone from women.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stones are rarely formed in women
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, it should happen to any of them that a stone occurs, then the care is difficult, and is prohibited by various methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: perhaps the woman is pregnant.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you will not find a woman who will confess to the doctor that she has a stone when she is chaste, or has a husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you will not find a woman who is well-versed in this art, especially the operation with the hand
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance of the stone from the place: because it requires deep incision, and there is fear in that
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels you to do that, then you must take a female doctor who is well-versed: and few are found
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you wish to do this beforehand, then seek out a wise doctor, discreet, and present to her a skilled woman in the art of midwifery, or a woman who has learned a part of the art: do this so that she will make known to you everything which she has learned about the stone from her inquiries
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, that she may see if the woman is pregnant: then she must insert her finger into her belly and feel for the stone
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she finds it, she should grasp it under her finger, and then command the obstetrician to insert her finger into the lower belly, and inquire about the stone, after she has placed her left hand over the uterus, and has pressed down firmly
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If, therefore, a stone is found, it is necessary that he gradually move it from the orifice of the bladder towards the lower parts with the sum of his skill, until it reaches the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should secrete over it towards the middle of the belly towards the root of the thigh from whichever side he wishes to prepare it, and he will feel the stone in that part: and his finger shall not be moved from the stone, coiling under it: and let there be a small incision in the beginning
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	And then he will introduce the radium through that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If, therefore, he feels the stone, then he will add to the incision the quantity that the stone comes out through that part.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	Of these there are some small and some large, some soft and some rough, some long and some round having a branch
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	You know therefore the kind of each of these, as it is signified by this above that to which it refers
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, therefore, it swells with blood, then add in the place of the wound some powdered alum, and keep it for an hour, until the blood is gone.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and make ready with me the instruments which I mentioned in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may aid me in this operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If there is a flow of blood and you know that the bleeding comes from the artery that was cut: then put powder on the place and bind it with threads of thread: and do not stop it: and let the stone go, and do not pull it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When blood flow has subsided after a day, and the place has become putrid, return to the operation until the bone has healed completely.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Concerning the incision for an aquous hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter XII
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The swelling of the aquous hernia is not due to pus, but to the accumulation of moisture within the white membrane which contains the testicles: and this is called a hernia
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in the proper sac of the testicles, which nature has prepared for it in part: until it is burst: which is another testicles, and the skin of the testicles between the white membrane which we have mentioned: and this does not happen except rarely
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this swelling is from the weakness which happens to the testicles: and therefore it leaks out onto these things
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colours
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or sometimes it is yellow-orange, or red-bloody, or greenish, or black, or white-watery, and this is the best of all
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which you know that there is an accumulation of water, are these
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white membrane which we have mentioned, then the swelling is rounded to the length like the shape of a testicle: and the testicles do not appear, because the moisture contains them from all sides
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if it is in the proper sac of the testicles, then the swelling is rounded with a part of the testicle, and because of this the man knows that there is another testicle
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white fat, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore one wishes to discern the color of moisture, then to experience the color of moisture in the afterimage with the introverted square, whose form precedes it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that therefore which proceeds from the introverted square, judge concerning that which is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary to give the sick person the opportunity to urinate, and to let the blood out if it is possible for him, and to fill his body with liquid.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he rests on his back over a high low thing, and puts under him many cushions.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left hand side, and command the minister, so that he sit on his right hand side, who extends his arm towards one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part near the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then grasp the broad spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along the length, until almost to the navel: and make the incision according to the straight line of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white fat encompassing: and scrape it off and observe, or cut it out directly, as you please: and your scraping should be such as that which you make when you scrape with your thumb: and scrape cautiously according to the amount that you are able to.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then perforate the full white fat with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the fat upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles encompassing: and cut the fat as you please, either entirely, or in fragments, especially the large one under the nail.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	If you do not scrutinize carefully, safety is not achieved in its incision, for water returns.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If, however, anything external to its cavity occurs during your operation: then when you have completed the incision, reduce it immediately.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like the rest of the wounds until it heals
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find anything corrupted from the black bile, then it is necessary that you bind up the parts that are its support, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicles with their support, and extract the contents: afterwards care for it as we have said
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water has gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two roots: dry therefore the other part equally
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if they are equal, as for the operation to be one, then do so: then drain the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the incisions a soaked lanet in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside the lanet another lanet which you have immersed in wine and oil, and expand between two testicles, and look into the belly: and place over them doubled layers of cloth, and these are nails: and bind them up above with a ligament which has six fingers according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	And cover with two sponges, and wash, and apply the carmine-colored plaster, according to this likeness: and let the extremities which are sent forth from the hip, or the moist lanet: and gather with the tightening in the lumbar region of the arms: and one extremity shall take over from the hip up to the shoulder, and the second shall take over from the part of the loin: and the two extremities above the two thighs, and the two extremities above the two knees, and the tightening shall gather all together in the lumbar region of the arms
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	When the artificial treatment has been made with the cautery at the place of section with the iron: then you shall take up the cautery in a subtle manner and cut through the skin of the testicles. And it is ignited, as we have said: until when the white fat containing water is discerned. Then you shall take up the cautery in the like manner.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	When the artificial treatment has been made with the cautery at the place of section with the iron: then you shall take up the cautery cautiously and cut through the skin of the testicles. And it is ignited, as we have said: until the white fat containing water is discerned. Then you shall take up the cautery in like manner.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then you shall perforate with it [the cautery] until that moisture has gone out entirely.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch out the fat with hooks, and peel it off with the cautery which is ignited in a subtle way, and cut through it as much as possible, until you have excised all of it
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And burn from behind, so that it does not touch the fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and longer from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with section
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, you make an opposite movement at the time of the section, or at the time of the after-burning of the cautery, or the flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary that you cure the thing which makes the opposite movement at the same time as the treatment which is suitable for it, according as has been said before
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect such a great operation because of his horror: then you shall perform perforation as I have said above: and it is like this
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain that it is like that which we have said concerning the signification of the ramex being aqueous: then you must cause the patient to sit upon a raised seat
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then perforate the abscess in the lower part of its belly with a wide spatula: and make the perforation according to the length of the body, and leave the opening wide open until all the pus has drained out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a pad over the place, and ligate it, and let it drain out until the rest of the pus has drained: then care for it until the wound has healed
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is opposition to the drainage of the pus in the hour when you perforate it: and this is not except for the white pus which makes opposition at the opening of the wound, and prevents the escape of the pus: then it is necessary to introduce a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which the hydropic fluid is extracted, which has a form before: or to add in the operation of the wound a little of the like.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you know, that the water returns, and collects after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it collects, then it should be closed according to the same manner, and pass through the painful days of its life.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of the flesh-muscle.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You know, that in the section above this Ramus, there is from the fear of carrying forward to mischief in many arrangements.</start_of_turn>
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore its dismissal from that is seen.</start_of_turn
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation on that, and the kind of abscess.</start_of_turn
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, that many abscesses happen in the bodies, from which testicles are composed: and this is from the pus of many things, namely.</start_of_turn
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute or acrid superfluousness, which flows down to the testicles.</start_of_turn
Aut ex percussione.	Or by percussion.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	The color of the swelling is according to the color of the body, and it does not cause pain: and it is a serious swelling.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a swelling of the stones, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And when it is from the rupture of arteries, and the swelling of the veins: thus is its memory remembered: or from the swelling of the veins themselves
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Which therefore is from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of the swelling, when you press it with your fingers.</start_of_turn>
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary that you touch it directly.</start_of_turn>
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is from the swelling of the veins, does not depart from that because of the pressure with your fingers.</start_of_turn>
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible that above this kind of swelling there will be an incision, and above the rest of the flesh: and it is like the cutting of the testicles.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the hand above, and extract it with white wool: and liberate the swelling from the veins, and ligate the veins: and cut the swelling when you have freed it from all parts of the hand.</start_of_turn
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the hand is consolidated with those natural parts of the body, then it is necessary to pull the hand, and cut it.</start_of_turn
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between some of the hairs, or in that which is between the veins: then it is necessary to free the whole adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.</start_of_turn
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is a natural part of the flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut all of it, and extract the hand, as we said.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When the operation is completed, take a wine-soaked sponge and wring it out into the wound, and afterwards care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Regarding the care of branches, which is with oil.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 122.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Uitis is a swelling which fills the quadra, like a bot, with the softening of the testicles: and it makes difficult the walking of a cripple and his exercise, and his walking about.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this disease is fear, because of that which precedes its remembrance
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	It is true that we must say that the operation for this is done as the first ones did it
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore that you must make the cripple sit upon a raised seat
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	And then drive the testicles towards the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	And then hold the testicles with your fingers, with the nails towards the veins: and hold them with another helper, and extend them with an extension of the palm of the hand
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	And then make an incision with a sharp knife across in the middle of the veins, until the veins are detected
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	And then remove it from all parts, as we said to you in the extraction of the arteries in their seasons
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	And then fix it in wax in which there is a double thread, and bind it in the first place where it occurs with the veins: and bind it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	And then dry them in the middle of a straight section according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the humours of corrupt faeces.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for one wound with the care of the rest of the wounds, in which you wish to generate health, so that the masses that nourish one testicle fall down.
Non est enim malum per illud.	Then care for one wound with the care of the rest of the wounds, in which you wish to generate health, so that the masses that nourish one testicle fall down. There is no evil in this.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If, however, the veins of all the masses go together, then it is necessary to remove the testicles along with the masses: so that they do not receive nourishment through incision, and that they may rot or decay, and not be of any use.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Of the care of the intestinal branches.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 15
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The event of this branch is from a section which happens in the large intestine above the belly in the groin part from the wonders of the belly
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the siphoning or from the extension of it
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds of rupture happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or elevation of a heavy thing, and the like.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign that it is from the extension of the siphoning.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	Is that which happens gradually in a long time, and does not happen immediately: and it is equal to the depth of the apostema: because the siphoning compresses the intestine
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of that is when it is from the section of the siphoning, because it makes the pain that is from the beginning to appear immediately: and it is a different apostema, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of it to the outside of the siphoning
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	When the gut comes out with the intestines: it is called a ramex of the intestines, and the intestines. And when it is with swelling.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	When stool runs into the intestine and is retained there: it is with it a cause of sickness. For it makes the abdomen swell and especially when it is discharged.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this disease of the intestines with iron there is fear: so one must be cautious of the cause of it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	The method of treatment is to remove the major parts of the illness from the patient, so that the intestine may return to its natural place within the cavity of the abdomen if it obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it is placed over the collar of its column between your hands: and lift its edges.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin which follows the skin upwards, and dry the whole surface of the testicles.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two hooks of section the intestines, according to what is necessary to open the section with the intestines: and the section should be made according to the quantity, as much as is possible, so that it may come out of it something.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then peel the fatty substance and what is under the skin of the testicles, until the white fat is detected, hard from all parts: then insert your finger into the index of that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white fat and the fat under the skin, and between the fat of the following part and that which is alongside it at the back of the testicle
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with the right hand the hand towards the inside of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white fat upwards, with the left hand: and lift the intestines with the fat towards the part of the section: and command the minister to extend the intestines upwards: and you will solve the adhesion which is at the back of the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And inquire about your fingers, that nothing is there from the intestines thrust into the flesh or hardened.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If, however, you find anything there: then push it down to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then grasp the needle, which has a thick thread made of ten threads: and insert it through the back of the flesh, that is, under the testicles which follow the incision: and cut off the ends which protrude from the thread until there are four threads left.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then make a loop with some of the thread over some other part with a shape like a cross: and tie it with a slip knot, as we have said, because it is under the testicles a ligature which should not hold anything which nourishes them from sending anything to them: so that it does not happen that the wound becomes cold again
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And make another knot outside the first knot, which is longer than the two fingers less two.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two knots draw out the rest of the flesh from the flesh under the testicles as much as the quantity of the finger: and cut off the rest entirely following the roundness, and remove from it all the fat
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry the lower part of the skin of the testicles which has been cut, from which blood runs, and heal: as we have said before
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply soaked wool in oil, and put on a bandage: and administer the knot which we have mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white gut which we mentioned has been cauterized after the incision, fearing the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Very often this happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And draw out the knot, until it comes down by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, the case lingers, then it is embroidered with warm water: and place above that which we have mentioned until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	And then care for the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Of a wound that is oozing.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this wound no one should be allowed to remain above its treatment with iron
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they say that it is like that which we have told in the wound which is like that of Vite.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, as a belt after a section above that with ease below: then dry in the middle, and care afterwards with that which opens it up until it falls off: and care for the wound, as we have mentioned, until it heals
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Of the disruption that is in the groin
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When it happens that there is a rupture in the groin, as we have mentioned, and the place is prominent, and does not descend to the testicles anything from the intestines: and if it descends, it is little, and returns in every hour: but if it is prolonged with that time, a tear is added in the groin, until the intestines descend into the groin
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the groin, which is in the groin as we have mentioned
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the groin is extended: then it becomes softened, and the place is prominent, and it descends.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with cautery, as it has been mentioned before
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is cured with iron, according to this manner: and the patient lies on his back between your hands
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture above the apostem and eminens, section through the breadth, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the ligature and what is under the skin until the white substance is detected, which is under the skin following the latter.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the needle and place it over the eminens from the substance, and press it down into the depth of the belly
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then take two points of the eminences from the edge of the substance and join them with a suture: then draw out the edge of the substance.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut through the substance entirely, neither tighten anything, nor do anything else, as I told you in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you have finished cutting the thread, close the wound and restore the skin, until it has healed together
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Do not draw the skin too tightly, and do not add to the thickness of the rupture
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to the substance.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Regarding the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Many people soften the skin of the testicles because in some of them the meats which are between them are softened, and the sight is spoiled thereby.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is treating him to make him urinate on his back, and to cut away the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then join together two lips with a suture: and if you wish, take away the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and tighten the suture
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then penetrate between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the remaining wounds until they are healed, and the sutures fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	¶ Of Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is prohibited in our law: and because of this I am forbidden to recall it in this book: and it is not necessary to recall it, except for two cases.</start_of_turn
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	Of which one is that it is in the science of medicine when it is asked about: and to know its treatment when it happens.</start_of_turn
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other is that we often do not approve of castration for some animals, because of the groans we suffer on account of it, such as oxen, asses, and goats, and similar animals.</start_of_turn
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways.</start_of_turn
Aut per attritionem.	Or by cutting.</start_of_turn
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision, and section.</start_of_turn>
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In the former of these, the operation is painful: for we make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles soften, and become limp, and hang down: and then cut through them with your hand, until they are dissolved and do not appear to the touch.</start_of_turn
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by incision and section, it is necessary to hold the animal firmly, and grasp the skin of the testicles with your left hand.</start_of_turn
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie up the suspension, and dry over every wound a single stitch, until when two holes have come out: then cut through them after you have scraped away everything outside the delicate sac, which is over the testicles.</start_of_turn
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And thus is the best method of castration by attrition: for attrition often leaves something from the testicles, which the beast desires for coition.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	There are two methods of care for hermaphrodites.</start_of_turn>
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.</start_of_turn
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is one of two kinds, from the urine.</start_of_turn
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them appears because it follows the space, or in the belly between the testicles, like a female dog, in which are hairs, and sometimes urine comes from the belly between the testicles.</start_of_turn
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one kind, which is like a female dog over the belly just like small testicles of a man, projecting outwards: one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.</start_of_turn
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the care of the three kinds, of the two from the urine and the one from the woman, is that you must cut away the meats added, until the impression of them is gone.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for the rest of the wounds.</start_of_turn
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	As for the second kind, which is that from which urine comes out, which is in the belly of the testicles, there is no operation, nor any care for it.</start_of_turn
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Of the incision of the hair, and the meat which projects outwards in the bodies of women.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.</start_of_turn
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The hair perhaps adds to the natural thing, until it is fed and becomes ugly: and sometimes it becomes big in some women so that it expands like in the urine, and continues until coition.</start_of_turn
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore that you should take hold of the superabundance of the Tentiginis mane, either alone or with one finger, and cut: and do not delay in the incision, especially at the root: lest there should occur a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself until it has healed.</start_of_turn>
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, the flesh which is born in the belly orifice, until it has filled itself up: and perhaps it comes out to the outside according to the shape of a tail: and for this reason it is called a tail-like wound.</start_of_turn>
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that we should cut in the same way as we cut the Tentiginis, and care for it, until it has healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	As for the care of the Alratica, which is the unpierced woman's wound.</start_of_turn
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.</start_of_turn>
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The Alratica is, as it is the unpierced woman's wound, or as it is a small hole.</start_of_turn
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	It is either natural or accidental.</start_of_turn
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from a wound which preceded it: and it is either from a piece of meat which has become added, or from fine sand, or from fat: and it may be either in the belly, or in the flanks, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it hinders coition and conception, and delivery, and perhaps hinders menstruation.</start_of_turn
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is by the aspect of the obstetrician, if the visible swelling is close at hand.</start_of_turn
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not apparent, then inquire about it with your fingers, or with an instrument.</start_of_turn
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If, however, the swelling is from a soft discharge close to the bone, then it is necessary to drain it, and break it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is necessary to place two fingers over the lips [of the wound].
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your two fingers of both hands together, and a woman should be placed above his back with her knees spread wide.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the soft discharge is broken and the swelling is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of wool and soak it in oil, and put it on the place: and the woman should keep it moist every day, so that it does not harden in another place.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the discharge is thick and large: then it is necessary to cut it out with a sponge-like bandage similar to the bark of myrtus
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the swelling is from natural tissue, then suspend the discharge with hooks, and cut it out: and there should be with you physicians who stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and the blood of a dragon, and thus gathered with alum or something like that.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then give a wide lead from lead, so that the wound does not harden too quickly, keep it for a few days: and give an ointment of dry linen, and then care for the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there is birth in the matrix of other tissues: it is necessary to do this in this way: while not there is a cancerous tumor in the matrix, do not do anything contrary to iron in any way
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red in women's ulcers.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are open ulcers of the veins, until blood flows excessively from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When they are thus diminished, hemorrhoids become small: and I have already spoken of the signs of these, and of the things which aid their treatment and those which do not
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the belly-button and are not visible to the eye: in such cases there is no cure with iron
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those which are in the belly-button above which sense has fallen are those which are cured
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore to put the woman in a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the little things with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut away their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over the wounds with powder from one of the incisions without causing pain: as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then put her feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her in cold water afterwards
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the bleeding persists: then make her sit in a decoction of rue, and nutmeg seeds, and barley, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood is thus separated with it, that is good: and if not, make the swelling adhere to the back, and swellings, without cutting
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and soak it in pitch juice, or in rue juice, or in pomegranate juice, that is, aloe, port wine, and make it adhere to the wound
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the limb is quiet, then care for the place with unguents until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	When the limb is quiet, then care for the place with unguents until it is healed.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut away whatever appears from it, as I have said before, and care for it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the perforation which occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of swellings occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and a stone abscess, and ulcer, and foreign bodies, and carbuncles, and herpes, and tumours, and fistulas, and haemorrhoids, and thread-like swellings, and cold abscesses
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I will say concerning all these ailments and their species, their signs and their cures in general: it is necessary to say in this treatise the cold abscess which occurs in the matrix, when it is caused by other swellings which unite health, and to write how its opening is made with an iron
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore to consider it
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	When the pain of the swelling in its beginning is acute with percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it turning red: if it falls beyond the sensation of it, then do not attempt to perforate it: care for it with that which will promote its healing, until the acute pain of the accident has ceased
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	When it is necessary to sit a woman over two chairs, and she recline, or she is put upon her back, and her feet are put at the lower part of her belly: and her hips are spread out, and she puts her arms under her hips, and ties both ligaments conveniently to this
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the obstetrix sit at the right side, and manage the instrument which opens the maternal orifice.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	And whose form comes into being in the things which are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you are about to administer this instrument, that the figs be placed as far as the Radio of the deep matrix of the woman: that there may not be that which enters from the instrument more than from the depth of the matrix, and harms the lower part.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If, however, the instrument be thicker than the depth, then you must place sponges upon the covering of the deep matrix: in order to prevent the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the matrix: and you must place a bandage, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and must hold the instrument, and must turn the minister of the bandage, until the depth of the matrix is opened
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the Exitura appears, and the hand is grasped, and is soft and yielding: then it is necessary to cut it off at its head with a broad knife
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the healthy parts have been evacuated, then it is necessary to place in the wound a soaked piece of lint dipped in saffron: or in olive oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the lint, and withdraw the section from the depth of the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally upon the matrix, and upon the belly wool soaked in water, in which there are small bubbles.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then care for two days with an unguent that is suitable for this, until it is healed
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and the wound are washed, it is to be cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the radix of lily, or long-stalked iris, is boiled: then return to the unguent.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If a vein has been concealed within the matrix, then it is necessary to exclude its treatment with iron, and indeed to treat it with that which we mentioned in the discussion.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	How obstetrics should handle unborn creatures, according to their unnatural position of emergence.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter Lxx.</start_of_turn>
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the Obstetrician to know at first the natural position of birth of a creature.</start_of_turn>
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, when a woman is pressed downwards by the attendants and wishes to smell the air, and she feels that something is pressing upon her from below which is different from the birth process, and if she is hastening the birth, then you know that this is a natural birth, and the head comes out first, and afterwards the tail: or the tail is suspended or hanging from the navel.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press the belly of the woman, so that the fetus comes down more quickly.</start_of_turn
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon the head, it also descends with the tail, and they move out together with ease.</start_of_turn
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever does not follow this part is unnatural and harmful.</start_of_turn
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For indeed, when the fetus comes out through its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one foot alone: or the head comes out alone, or the belly comes out: and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar things happen which are not natural.</start_of_turn
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent and cautious in all these matters, and to fear mistakes and negligence: and I will show you all the figures and their meanings, and I will explain them to you so that you will be able to understand them.</start_of_turn>
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges from the head by its natural egress, and it mounts upon the woman, and its delivery becomes difficult, and the aid of its virtue is hindered: then let the woman sit down, or let the women hold her: and let steam rise from the bath of vinegar and decocted fenugreek with oily substances.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then let the obstetrician introduce his fingers between the toes of the parous woman, and find the second finger, and cut it off with his nail, until he has run off what is in her from moisture: and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be stimulated with a sponge of fenugreek with oil of sesame seed
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her to strain: and make her wipe with a towel, and hold her hand and nose for an hour together
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will immediately issue forth.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out at first, it is necessary to reduce them gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey in delivery, then let the woman sit down, and elevate her feet above the level: then strike the seat upon the ground: and the woman shall be held, lest she should fall by the concussion.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If, however, the hands do not issue forth, and the fetus dies: then cut off the hands, and draw out the remainder of the fetus: and bind up the hand with cloth, and draw it out with equality: for it will issue forth itself
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo from its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out from its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards: then slowly turn the fetus: afterwards equalize it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then he shall take one foot of his and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they have gone as far as the hips, then command him to bend his knee, and let him rest: he will go out of himself, if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	If he does not go out of himself as we have said, then reduce his foot gradually, until you have set it according to its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will go out of himself when he wishes to go out.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is hindered that he should go out of himself as we have said: then take from the thick slime of the armpits, and smear it with oil, and gum dissolved: and pierce all this with a good needle: then draw out with the thumb of a woman, and downwards into his belly
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make him sit in warm water, until his pulse subsides.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When his lower parts are warmed by the water, then make for him a plaster of myrrh: and leave it on him
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When an hour has passed since you put on the plaster, then make him sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make him cough: and bind his jaw and nose: and press down the lower part of his belly with ease
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the urine will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The urine comes out over the knee and hand
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When he has gone out in this manner, then insert your hand inside gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman lies down on his neck, and leans his feet downwards: and she herself lies down on a bed, and joins her hands together
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then first above the belly of it gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under its feet from the heel, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If it does not come out, then grasp its feet and move them with force.</start_of_turn>
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then first above the hip gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.</start_of_turn
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then introduce your hands, and equalize the fetus gradually: and command the woman, that she may compress, until the fetus comes out.</start_of_turn
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus comes out laterally hanging from the hands.</start_of_turn>
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Beware in the reduction of its hand.</start_of_turn
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however you are unable to reduce it, then elevate the woman, and make her walk.</start_of_turn
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she is unable to walk, then make her lie upon a stretcher: and strike her thighs with a blow of force.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you prepared from mucilages.</start_of_turn
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she bears a part, then make her sit upon a seat.</start_of_turn
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study in the reduction of the hand, and equalize the fetus according to its natural figure: and command the woman to press, and tell her to compress herself, until she comes out.</start_of_turn
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus comes out upon its collar, with expanded hands, and its face is towards the mother's back.</start_of_turn
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the Obstetrician grasp the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it back, and equalize it with ease.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When the edges are equal, then place over its belly what we have mentioned from fat and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command him to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then make him sit on his seat, and command him to lean to his right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command him to compress: and make him snort with pain
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The fetus is prepared to come out on the right side
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it has descended to the birth opening in this way with the second [finger], then split the second with your nail until it is evacuated from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended on the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it does not remain and does not die
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then drive the fetus inwards until you place it according to what is required: and command the woman to compress herself a little: for he himself will go out through the easy exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are often born together: and sometimes three, and four are born together.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is an unusual thing, and rarely happens
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five or more is a thing beyond nature, and does not often happen: and it contains those which, although multiplied, are one: and they are separated by the navel, distinguishing between each of them that which is connected to each of them
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out like a single fetus through the natural opening, easily: and they come out through the difficult opening, as we have mentioned
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If any of them are difficult at the part, and they reach that which we have mentioned from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have said: and let the obstetrix be gentle, and let her do what she does with ease and tardiness, and she shall succeed in every figure as she is accustomed to with that which is prepared for her from the leading mind for safety.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and aborts.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and I have seen that a woman has aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of whom were formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which is done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore all this is necessary that it should be in the science of Midwifery
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps also it will reach like that: oppose it with that which is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus with that which I said in the discourse from medicine, and it does not go out, and you must do so by operation with the hand, then you must consider it.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If a woman is healthy and of good virtue, and is not with any of the things from which she is afraid that she will lose her life: then it must be that she rests over her bed, over her back, and that her head is inclined downwards, and her legs are elevated: and the minister shall hold her fast by two parts, or she shall be bound to the bed, so that her body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the os matricis with oily things with high mucus, and chaff of aloes, and linseed seed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the Obstetrix shall wet his hand with these oils and mucilages: then he shall insert it into the matrix with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he seeks the place where the ribs rest upon the fetus, and the convenient location for it
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore at that time, if the fetus is ready to descend over its head: then fix the ribs to its eyes, or to its neck, or to its mouth, or to its palate, or under its beard, or under its ribs, or in nearby places to the ribs, and under the hyoid bone
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is over its feet, then in the chest, and the middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that he grasp the hook with his right hand: and he shall place his thumb in that place which is between the left thumb and little finger: and he shall insert it with the hand with ease, and he shall fix the hook in some one of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches the desired thing.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he shall fix the other hook, or the third one, if necessary: so that there is an equal tension, and it does not lean towards one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then the extension shall be equal, and it shall not be extended only in a straight line, but it shall be moved to all parts, so that it may relieve the exit: thus it is done with a tooth in extracting it
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary at that place where the extension is, to soften the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	Which if it is retained from that side, then it is necessary that the Obstetrix grasp some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that it will recoil with that which is retained
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore the part of the fetus comes out, then change the nails to another place which is higher: do this until the fetus comes out entirely
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If the hand goes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its compression: then it is necessary that the hand be bound above the palm.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then draw out the hand until when it goes out entirely, it hangs by the edge either at the wrist or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you make in the other hand, and in two feet
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the head of the fetus is great, or if it has received compression on its exit, or there is water in its head: then it is necessary that you introduce between the fingers a thorned sponge, and find with it the head, and extract the water: or break it with an instrument which is called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the following chapter.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise do thus if the fetus is of great head-size: then it is necessary that you cut through the membrane: or extract it with force, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	When the head comes out, and is compressed at the furculum: then it is found, until the humidity which is in the chest is drained out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it does not become complicated, neither will it agree to go out: then cut off the head roughly, as much as is possible to you
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If indeed the lower belly is swollen with fluid, or there is water in it: then it is necessary that you perforate it, until the humidity from it comes out
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the fetus is above his feet: then its traction is easy, and its direction towards the maternal bones is smooth
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is compressed at the belly, or the chest: then it is necessary that you extract it with the bandage which you bound above your hand: and find the belly, or the chest, until it comes out by itself.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If, however, the remaining limbs are removed and the head remains: then the Obstetrix inserts his left hand into the head.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the mouth of the matrix is opened: then he inserts his hand deep into the matrix and grasps the head, and pulls it until it reaches the mouth of the matrix: then he inserts one or two fingers into it and pulls it out with them.</start_of_turn>
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mouth of the matrix is closed, because of a thick clot that has happened to it: then it is not necessary to work above it, rather it is necessary to administer an effusion of soft things: and to apply plasters: and to sit in water which softens and moistens.</start_of_turn>
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its side: then it is possible to make it even: then the following is administered for the fetus itself.</start_of_turn>
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do this, then it is done hastily, and it is extracted.</start_of_turn>
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything remaining inside at all.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said concerning the clots which happen in the matrix.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there is a flow of blood: then descend into the waters of styptics, and administer the remaining treatment.</start_of_turn
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have seen a woman in whose womb there was a dead fetus: then she was impregnated over her with another, afterwards the other fetus also died.</start_of_turn
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	This happened to her after a long time there was a clot in her navel, and it became swollen, until it opened: and pus began to flow from it.</start_of_turn
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I have been called to his aid and have treated him for a long time: and the wound has not healed.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I have placed above it some strong adhesive plaster: and it has come out of its place at the bone's location.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then some days passed by, and the bone came loose again from another side
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I am doubtful that it will recover, since there is no bone in the middle
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I think that the bone is dead from its roots
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I asked about the wound, and I extracted many bones from her, a woman who is in better health than usual: and I have treated her for a long time, and she sends out a little pus from the place
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	I do not know for certain what is the cause of this, except that it is a knowledge and an art that a physician who is an artificer has with his hand in the treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Of the forms of the necessary instruments for extracting bones from the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Strictor, with which books are equaled, to which are equal two strings at the extremities of two sticks.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	True, this vertigo must be smaller than the strictor: and it must be made either of ebony or of seasoned wood
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each stick is like two fingers: and the margin of each of them is like one finger, and the length of each of them is palm and a middle: and in the middle of the two sticks are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are firmly fixed in both of them, whose length is half of the palm and a little less: and the width of each of them is like two fingers, or less
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additional things are introduced into the matrix bone, so that it opens when you rotate two Vertigines.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	When two Vertigines are rotated, these two additional things are introduced into the matrix bone so that it opens
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	The like of that, but smaller and smoother.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	They are made from the wood of the bone or from horn, according to the likeness of pincers
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	There are indeed two additional things at its extremity here: as above: and their length from the heel to the tip is like a palm, and their width is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you wish to open the matrix with this, then make a woman sit over a bench, with her feet hanging down, and open that which is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	And then introduce these two additional things together into the matrix: and you hold the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, like making with pincers, equally according to the quantity that you wish to open the opening of the matrix, until the Obstetrician wishes to stop it.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The like of that, as the ancients said, is the form of the Impelling Force which drives out the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The shape of the Alma, which counteracts the large head: and it is assimilated to the pincers, which have teeth at the extremity, like these things.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is bent, like the pincers according to this shape, like these things, which have teeth like saw teeth, with which it incides and counteracts
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The shape of the Alma which counteracts the small head
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The shape of the neighbor having a single spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of the neighbour who has spines two.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The shape of the forceps which have teeth like a saw, with which the head of the foetus is held.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of the spatula which has two extremities to bind the head
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of two spatulas also of the hands
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are used for this purpose, and the more numerous the species of these, and the more are prepared by the artificer, the faster is the operation and the greater for the men, on account of their quantity
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	It does not behove you to despise the things of the instruments which are prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is not unreasonable that you should have them.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	About the extraction of the second one.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head seventy-eighth.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second one is retained at the delivery, then it is necessary to grasp the lower parts, so that it retains its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make the grasp with the thumb and the index finger: and stretch out your hand over its bone, and take hold of its breath.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it comes out by this means, that is good
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then grasp the head firmly, and pierce through the skull in the suture: and put in it herbs which are applied to the bone, such as calamus, rue, and mugwort, and chamomile, and hyssop, and saffron, and pitch: grasp all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and put them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a bundle of reeds over the hole in the skull of the jar, and the other extremity in the bone of the matrix: and keep it there until the steam reaches the cavity of the matrix.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make the incision, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	Then indeed it will flow out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if it remains after this treatment, and does not flow out: then command the Obstetrician, that he plunge his hand into the belly of the patient, or sprinkle it with alum.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert the hand into the belly, and search with it for the Secundina
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When you find it, then seize it, and draw it out slowly
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If it is an appendix which lies deep in the belly, then insert the hand as we have said, until you find the Secundina. Then draw it out slowly according to the rule, so that the belly does not tear at the time of traction: it is better to move it to the right and left sides: and then add in the quantity of traction
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	Then indeed it will obey, and will be cured, and will go away from adhesion
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the belly is closed, as we have said: treat it with an incision, and with medication from an oil jar with herbs
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not flow out with all that we have said: then be careful that you do not tire yourself in the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is indeed necessary that what flows out to the belly-opening should be bound to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then close the incision with four herbs.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	It will itself decay the incision after a few days, and will be dissolved, and will flow out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Indeed when it decays, it will emit a bad odor from the belly and the head, and will make that worse the illness.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered thereupon.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients are experts in fumigation with naphtha and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The manner in which a woman is fumigated with respect to the retention of the second [menstrual] and the menses
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be like the smoke of an incense burner, or from a cone: and put the broad end over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed over the berries: hold it there until the fumigation is consumed: and do it again for the other side
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	About the treatment of an unpierced animal
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with unpierced noses, and their animals also have unpierced noses, which I have treated with subtle sponges
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary that the midwife pierce that sponge with her finger: and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula: and beware of tears, lest they touch it
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put upon it infused wool in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with nails until it heals
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If, however, it is to be opened, then put in the cavity a lead cannula for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to fart
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And sometimes the piercing of an animal is done even from the swelling or from the pus
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary that the swelling be drained, and then care for it as we have said concerning treatment and lead
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	About the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas which happen in the lower parts are Nodatio and Grossitudo, which happen close to any deformity: or in the space of one part. And there is one fistula, or more.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When the Nodatio is old, it opens, and there runs from it a white watery moisture, or subtle pus
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore they are recognized as penetrating by the thing which comes out with the discharge, and by the swelling, when the patient uses the bowels: and sometimes it comes out with worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas from these things when they are penetrating from the space until the bladder, and until the membrane of the intestines
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating from these things until the hip joint, and until the node of the buttocks
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this it is known that a penetrating fistula until the limb, even if it is not penetrating, is when you insert your finger indicating towards the limb: and you insert a subtle attempt into the fistula from the air, or from iron, when there is no distortion
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	When there is distortion in this, then insert into the fistula a subtle lead weight, or a hair from a horse's tail, until you feel the attempt, or a hair in your finger
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel the attempt, neither does anything come out of the discharge, neither swelling, nor worms as I have said: then you know that it is not penetrating: depart therefore for treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating until the bladder, or until the membrane of the urine: then the meaning of this is the escape of urine from it, and the prohibition of this from happening again so that the place is consolidated with the doctors.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If the wound extends up to the hip joint or the hip bone: then its sign is that the limb hangs limp until that point, if there is no curvature of the limb up to the bone. And there is pain around the part, and discharge of pus from it always. And it does not heal in it, neither is it consolidated with oil.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	In all such penetrating wounds there is no cure; the cure for them is toil and perseverance, from the stupid doctors who cause them.</start_of_turn>
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in those which are neither penetrating nor old, healing is expected with rest: as I have said before, and as I have shown: that the patient should lie between your hands on his back, and raise his legs up to above his hips, and that his knees should be bent towards his belly.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce lead or air, if there is curvature of the wound, until you know where the limb hangs limp.</start_of_turn>
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the patient feels pain around the part, then you must insert your finger into the part.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel in your finger an attempt to penetrate itself which you have recognized, besides that which you feel between your finger and the bone, or meat: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: it is not to be treated, for its cure is not as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They say that in some people the wound heals with scar, and from the medicine which is expected to be applied, that is, to apply gentle cautery according to the size of the wound, and to insert the flame into the wound until it hangs limp around the part.</start_of_turn
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	And do this again two or three times, until you know that all the fatty tissues which are similar to the veins of birds have been consumed.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for that with buttered cloths until they depart those meats which are bound: then care for that with unguents which generate flesh and consolidate.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is thus healed, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	If not, then it will not be healed by any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	If it comes out a little, and does not suffice up to the thumb which is in the groin, and is between that and the fleshy swelling of the flesh, or pus: then make an incision at that point which follows the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the incision, and you will dry with the thumb which is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches the extremity of the thumb, and the thumb is freed and falls off.</start_of_turn>
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then soften those meats which have been drained, which absorb the bristles of a quill bird, so that nothing remains of it.</start_of_turn
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however it is stained with blood, and dissolves between you and the operation which you have made to cut away those meats: then it is better to cauterize with fire, or with acute medicine.</start_of_turn
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For indeed cauterization with fire unites good habits, adds adulation to those meats which have been bound, and cuts off blood, and dries moisture.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for that with buttered cloths, or bruised leaves, until that place emits pus, and those meats which have been bound in the pus depart in it.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for it with solid unguents which consolidate, generate flesh firmly: and these are medicines which have stypticity and drying properties.</start_of_turn
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then it is healed: and do not do it again.</start_of_turn
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If, however, the fistula persists until it reaches the depth of the rectum, and is prolonged by the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the rectum and inquire what you feel.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If you feel resistance there, and between you and the rectum is something like a piece of gravel, or flesh, and it is close to the perforation: then there is no operation in that case, except according to the degree of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	For in such a case one must administer three things: either to cauterize the fistula itself, as we have said: or to dissect the wall, until you reach its concavity, so that you may afterwards be able to insert instruments and cure it from the next time
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed with much dissection, lest you lacerate the wall containing the rectum, and cause excessive discharge of faeces without their consent.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for it as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal by itself: or you will lengthen that piece of gravel and cleanse it after you have dried it up to near the rectum, as we have said, or with your finger, or with some other pointed instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean the torn flesh that is in the incision, until it is firm when you scratch it with your finger.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt to restore the whole wound with the incision, and the upper orifice where it is closed: and the fistula will remain open in the inner part of the rectum, and will be less harmful.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when you suture the fistula in this way: and that is when you insert your finger into the fistula: and it is on the side of the rectum surrounding the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the rectum: then grasp the perforated extremity, which is like a nail, that is, prepared to pierce the skin, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into the loop of the thread which is involved from five threads, and encircle it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the needle with the thread through the fistula, until its curve follows that of the fistula.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it is penetrating through the inner margin of the anus near the base, then withdraw the thread from that hole: thus you will insert your finger into the anus and withdraw the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and tighten both of them, and let them go on one day, or two days: and the more the thread has penetrated the flesh, tighten it well, until those pieces of flesh which are between the two ends of the thread fall away: then care for the wound, until it has healed and is sound
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way you prepare it, except that it should not be too deep
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	Neither should you make it penetrate because of tears, lest you damage it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do as we have said, until it has healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Make a sponge shaped like the fistula, whose curvature is acute downwards, and the other part is not acute, so that you do not damage that which is not necessary, like urine
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Regarding the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood runs out from the incision of them: and care for the tears.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are inside the anus, similar to grapes or plums: or they are like little grains of wheat
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And they are of two kinds: small and large: and blood always runs from them, and there is one, and they are many
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	They are outside the knee, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	They are outside the knee, and at its extremities.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	The treatment of that which is inside the knee is, that the patient be made to flex the limb: and it should be expressed until the anus comes out, and the discharge appears.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, bind it up with bandages: or hold it with your finger
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut through at the roots of its hairs.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they do not hold in the knee, because of the moisture of the humors and their softening: then bind the limb with rough cloth, or with felt from wool, and draw it out with your fingers
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut through, and powder over the wound after cutting whatever powder is warm, so that it stays in its place like cautery
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize it according to what was said in the chapter on cautery.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the limb with the remaining treatment, until it heals
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not come out, then instill the patient with a little enema in which there is a slight biting, so that it is forced out with the feces, when the patient flexes the limb
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the little ones are outside the anus, then the matter is easy: and it is as if you grasp the limb with your finger, or grasp it with the thumb, and cut through it
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for the limb as we have said, until it heals
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever dislikes the cutting with the knife, must administer a suture of it according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Grasp the slippery thread and introduce it into the hole.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Extract the plug to the upper parts, and cause it to penetrate with the needle at its root from the opposite side: and pass through two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and make them lie parallel: and tighten the thread strongly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread and extract the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the plugs, and draw them out one at a time: do not leave them in, lest they cause excessive bleeding.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place upon each wound a soaked pad of infused fabric in rose-water, or vinegar, and place it upon the wound: and command the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it has healed.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the plugs have healed, care for the incisions with unguents, and leave the treatment until the wound has healed
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	(The text continues with instructions for wound care.)
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Many times these arise from excessive discharge of stool, and from the constriction of the natural passages.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When these have been lessened, and do not yield to medical treatment: then it is necessary to rub with Spatumil's sponge, or with your finger, until they become soft, and remove from the outer layer which hinders consolidation
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for the wound, until it consolidates as it should
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If, however, they do not consolidate: then repeat the wound-cleaning with more force than before, until they bleed profusely, and are then cleansed again with care, until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	(The text continues with instructions for treating wounds caused by insects, such as fleas and mosquitoes.)
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that the Almirmar is not except a round knot according to the colour of the body, like the head of a nail: and it is in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and the fingers: and it happens from a wound in the flesh causing pain while walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore that it be cut off which is round about the nail, and be held fast with forceps, or with a hook, and be eradicated from its root
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for it: and if you wish you may cauterize it according to what has gone before in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	And from the heel there is a small elevation, rough, filtered, rounded above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often happen in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its care is to extend the heel and cut it: or to bind it with a silken thread: or with hair, until it falls out.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said with fire, or with acute medicine: and thus the heel is eradicated both forwards and backwards, and not backwards only with the instrument which I have mentioned
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	There is also a small, filtered elevation, large, above the surface of the body, which extends inwards downwards: and when it is touched by cold, there is in it a sensation like that of the bite of an ant, and it is in the whole body: and most of it is in the hands
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its care is to take hold of a needle from the beak of a bird, or a strong nail: and put it on the Ant, until the circle of the needle is contained by its parts
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then withdraw your hand with the needle, until you have severed what is around the Ant: and you put it deep into the flesh, and you pull out the Ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if so, do it with an air cannula or iron, according to this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	The tip of the cannula should be above the base of the thumb, so as to relieve tension on the thumb and its return
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if so, cauterize the area according to what is stated concerning the cauterization of the thumb in the chapter on cauterization
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the forms of instruments which are used for boils in the carbuncles of the hand, and the solution of the belly, and the colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When a boil arises from silver, or gold, or from blown or hammered copper.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when these instruments are small and large, according to those which are used for them
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	This is done in the treatment of young children with loose or painful ribs, as well as boils of them
Clistere magnum.	A large boil
Cistere paruum.	A small boil
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The upper part of the thumb, which is bound by the ligament, should be wide according to this fashion: and there should be a distinction so that the ligament is bound as with liquid, and the lower part which goes into the palm should be solid, that is, not open, soft, pliable, stretching towards thinness: and on one side there are two holes and on the other side one hole
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, somewhat smaller, and the thumb in which the medicines are placed from the animal's belly: or from paper wool, which is according to the shape of the asphodel seed: whose root is the sole palm
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it is pierced through with many holes as it is turned around, and there is space which is between every large hole is the size of a digit.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	And then introduce into these holes a strong thread from a raw thread, which is from ten threads, or thereabouts, and bind it together like asphodel seeds.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When it is thus placed in the body, it is sutured at the head of the wound between two marks of constriction which are strong
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	And then ligate it with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	This is the form of the circle which is here depicted, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the ligation with it is: that you implement both an abutment and a portion from medicine which is warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance: and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold, nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	And then the patient is laid down on his back, and he raises his legs upwards: and put under it a cushion, that is, skin which people lie upon, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	And then anoint the extremity of the ligation with oil, or with alum, or with barley flour, or like these things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	And then introduce it into the wound with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	And then take hold of the thread with two hands simultaneously, and pull it out with force, until it has evacuated everything that is in the ligation into the intestines
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	And then draw out the ligation, and raise the patient's legs to the side of the body.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	And if the medicine thinks that it should be drawn out, then hold it as much as you can
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is very dangerous indeed
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you have instilled it in the bowels of the solution of the belly, and it hastens its exit: then repeat the enema until it is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the rectum, then let the enema be gentle and soft, without excessive force
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of the gentle enema over which there is tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of wounds of the head without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the discourse on the treatment of wounds that it agrees with the book, and I will speak here of the treatment of them with the hand and with the physician according to the supplement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore, that wounds are varied according to the thing that causes the wound and according to the place where the wound falls
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things that cause wounds are many, as for example the fall of a stone: or the bite of a sword or knife: or the impact of a lance, or wood, or an arrow: and the like of these from many things
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds, however, which are caused by the place of the body are as follows: for example, a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the limbs: and the like of these from the various parts of the body.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I speak of the treatment of some wounds, in order to give the reason and rule concerning the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with the simple wounds of the head: because the composition of the head will be remembered at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When it happens in the head a single [tooth] which is not fractured of bone: consider then, if it is from the action of a stone, or like it: and it has split the skin only: and it is a large tooth, and times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: then proceed, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay it: and extract from it from the blood according to the quantity of its virtue: if there be no obstacle to the phlebotomy, especially if there be little blood issuing from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the side opposite the wound.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient be guarded from repletion, and wine, and coarse food
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If anything hinders the reduction [of the swelling], then do not give food, and do not approach meat, nor drink.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put over the tooth if it happens to it a soft swelling in saffron butter alone, or with wine in which there is stypticity
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are secure from the soft swelling, then put over the tooth what is common with its blood, and do not move it, powder which I will tell you afterwards: and if it has moved, then put over it some unguent until it has healed
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the tooth is large, or if it is from a cut of the knife, and like these: and the lips of it do not adhere by stitches, then adhere them together with the suture, according as I will tell you in the wounds of the belly about the suture of them
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the tooth is detected from the bone, and hangs, and its retention is not necessary, except for a small suspension: then cut it off
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the tooth with the doctors, and restore in it solid flesh instead of skin, and command the patient, that he eat coarse food like heads, and barley cooked, until the swelling has gone down: and like these things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find in the wound putrefaction that does not adhere to the bone: then cut through the whole putrefaction and throw it away; afterwards care for the wound.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however in the wound there is an artery or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by medicines: then inquire concerning the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not severed, then dry it with Spatumil or ligate it.</start_of_turn>
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If indeed necessity compels you when it does not confer what we have said: then burn it, until the blood is severed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however the wound is small and simple: then the matter is easy and light: thus as to rub over it with this powder: because it strengthens it before it changes it with air.</start_of_turn
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of applying the powdered incense.</start_of_turn>
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe: take part one of olive oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt chalk: mix them all together thoroughly, and sprinkle them: and apply it to the wound, and bind it securely, until it adheres well to it and clots with the blood.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then string up the wound with hairs, and let it go, and do not wash it until it has healed, so that it does not burst.</start_of_turn
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For it is not driven out by medicine until it has healed.</start_of_turn
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it makes the sole plaster, when there is neither olive oil nor dragon's blood in it: it also makes the same operation in many great wounds, when it is convenient to put it on and bind them, and when the wounds are fresh with their own blood, which has not changed air.</start_of_turn
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If the wound has been altered by a fourth part of an alteration, especially when it is in the summer season, then its position is not intended here: care for it as we have said, so that you place upon it some oily unguents of digestion: or you place upon it barley meal pultes made with water and honey, until pus is emitted.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If indeed it happens that there is a fracture in a bone which is small, then extract that with Gesti: and I will tell you the treatment of fractures of the head in this which the future is.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If indeed a wound happens in the neck, then there is no difference between it and a wound of the head when it is simple
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If indeed the nerve of the neck is cut, or an artery: then if it is the nerve, it is not in vain, unless you direct the treatment of it with that which makes stypticism like cinnamon, rue, and ivy, and things of that kind.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For they do not know the nerves, and they oppose them
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold upon the wound at all: for the substance of nerves is cold, and the continuation of it is with the brain, which is the soul of the limbs: and let that be treated by physicians gently, like chalk dust mixed with sweet water, or with rose water, and oil, when it is bathed even with sweet water: and the rest of the mineral stones, according to this method, and oily unguents
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If indeed the wound is large, then administer a suture: or close its lips with little pillows.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself until you are healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound is deep, or if it occurs in a sinus in the lower part of it, where pus accumulates, then perforate it in a depressed place in that area.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If blood flows from the wound due to an injured artery: then separate it, or dry it up, and ligate it: or cauterize it if necessary.</start_of_turn>
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the cartilage of the epiglottis, or all of it, is fractured and the fragments are close together: then unite the edges of the skin with sutures above the edge of the epiglottis, and do not touch the epiglottis, but keep it even, and reduce it to its natural position.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it loosely with a bandage, and discharge it in a few days.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself with unguents which have styptic and drying properties, until you are healed.</start_of_turn>
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, a wound has made an imprint in a bone, then uncover it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract them all, or whatever can be removed: and what cannot be prepared, leave it, until the wound has healed, and the fracture has been separated and consolidated.</start_of_turn
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound was burnt, then powder over it the powder which I mentioned.</start_of_turn
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, bone is seen in the wound, and there is an fistula: then care for it as is mentioned in its chapter.</start_of_turn
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	(The provided text does not include any information regarding a wound in the armpit, so I cannot translate this sentence.)</start_of_turn>
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.</start_of_turn>
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is percussion of the lance or the knife, and you know its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If there is discharge from the wound, when the patient groans in pain, then you know that the wound is mortal
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it does not have depth and is accompanied by blood: do not immediately apply powder or ligate it, lest you trap the blood in its depth and it returns to the heart, causing the patient's death. But put in the wound a proper dressing and leave it for two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If indeed no dressing is present at the opening of the wound: put in the mouth of the wound a thick wool cushion, so that it absorbs what comes out of it from the humours. And make the patient sleep on the wound so that it may heal what collects in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed three days or more have passed from the opening of the wound, and the patient does not suffer spasm, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor bad constriction in swallowing, and the rest of his symptoms are good: then you know that the wound is healed
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Care for it diligently and according to the laws, and with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing is excused, and it always opens again: then you know that a fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Care for it from its head to its foot
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then care for it as if it had been sutured, if it is large: or with powder if it is small
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however it has made an imprint in the bone, and has burst from it: then inquire about the wound and properly remove the splinter if it is separated
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separated, then depart them, until the bone becomes rotten, and the wound is relieved by the extraction of the foreign body.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The remaining wounds of the accident in the other limbs is the judgment in their care, which is what we have already said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning the wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestine, and the extraction of the foreign body.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which occurs in the belly is great, medium, or small
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great one, therefore, sometimes the intestine comes out, or a number of intestines
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore the evacuation of the foreign body is more difficult and painful and more difficult to suture
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small rupture is also difficult because of another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that the reduction of the foreign body is more difficult if you do not immediately perform the introduction into its place: because it is swollen, open, and thickened: which makes its entrance difficult
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, it is better for the rupture to be medium: because with this one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with the two previous kinds
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of the wound is done in four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures communicate properly with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, there are also specific methods with the suture of the belly: and I will tell you about one and the other with exposure and declaration
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say, because when the wound is small, and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then this is because of one or two of these methods
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Whether by the density of the disruption or because of the inflation in the intestines caused by cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	If either of these things be the case, then it is necessary to apply heat, so as to soak the sponge or cloth in warm water alone
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil in water barley, ginger, pepper, and caraway seeds along with the intestines until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When it makes such a drink which has a styptic action: it is better than plain water for resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When the inflation has been resolved, then moisten the intestines with the warm water in which it was boiled, or with vinegar
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For thus it will soothe its entrance with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however he vomits after this treatment, then look for a small opening in the disruption where the hemorrhoids were excised with the instrument
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	The first treatment is better when it is prepared beforehand, than when it is performed hastily: and it does not cause a cutting after necessity and the imperfection of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part be acute and the other not acute, and the extremity be neither soft like wool nor hard like obsidian, but rather somewhat soft like hair: and this is like urine.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the bladder is increased and the intestine is brought in, then it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural shape in its own place, if possible: for this is better
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary to make the patient lie upon his back and place his knees above his head
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	If it is in the upper part of the belly, then put the head of it upwards, and the feet downwards from it.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	If there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your thought on this, so that the part which has the wound is above the other part
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	It is thus necessary, that you observe this with great care in large wounds and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, put it according to what is prepared for you
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it present between your hands, which hold the entire rupture together: and join its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then draw out from it something that follows the suture one thing after another: and this is the way of common suture of one thing.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take needles, or the number of needles according to the quantity of the wound
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then draw out from the edge of the rupture the quantity of the little finger, that is, the physician: and fix the needle one beyond what you put into the flesh in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of fat which is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from another side, and when you have gathered together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of fat: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then string with a double thread around the circumference of the needle several times from two parts together, until two lips of the wound are aggregated with a descent.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then draw out the length of the finger also, and fix in the flesh another needle: afterwards tighten the flesh with the thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to make it until you have completed the constriction of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The needles should be of medium size between the thickness and fineness: for the fine needles are easily broken or slip through the flesh, and the thick needles are difficult to pass through the skin. Therefore it is necessary that they be of medium size in fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	It is not permitted that the needle be placed at two adjacent ends of the skin close together: for it will break the flesh easily and open the wound before it has healed, and will also lengthen the wound even after it has been sutured, for it will prevent the wound from healing properly
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then prick the extremity of the needle, so that it does not harm the patient during his sleep: and place upon it a few wool cushions from all sides, which will hold the extremities of the needle: and let them go when you know that the wound has healed
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this is the kind of stitching which is most suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For it is sufficient in stitching them to use one needle, or two, or a few.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second kind of suture is common, as it joins together four extremities: two of the skin and two of the fat with the needle in the middle, with the thread equally thick and thin.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced through with the needle with the four extremities, reduce the needle from the part from which you began and let the thread go from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture will be like the suture of cloth which joins cloth together, and place between every suture as much of the thickness of a small finger
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of suture is known to men
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And when such a suture has been made, I will make a hole at the point where the wound has occurred in the belly, which has been caused by the knife, and there will be a disruption of the wound greater than the palm of one hand: and it will go out of the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there will be a disruption in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	It will be reduced thus after it has remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	It has been consolidated thus in a space which remained about fifteen days: and I have treated it, and it has healed: and it has left after that many years, being restored to its own condition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And indeed, it happened by a miracle that I did not treat it with unguents
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where unguents were not to be found, and no one among the physicians had them.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I put upon the wound a thick wool cushion twice a day, and I took care of its ablution with sweet water until it healed
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	There are two kinds of sutures which I shall speak of according to the narration of the sermon.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is like this, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you carry the point through from the outside to the inside of the part
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When you have thus pierced the skin, and in the tough membrane you have pierced according to the length and breadth of the whole body: you will draw out the point of the needle in the side in which you put it in, and make the point penetrate from the inside outwards in the opposite side
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have thus made the needle penetrate, then make it penetrate once more through this in the same point from the outside inwards: and draw out the point which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate from the inside outwards through the opposite side: and make the needle penetrate with the same penetration as you made when you made the needle penetrate the tough membrane
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then commence also from this side, and hold the organ itself with the extremity which is from the heel to the side, and extract the point from the skin as it penetrates.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce the skin to that side, and hold the extremity of the heel which is on the other side, with this extremity make a mark: and extract that point from the skin which is on its side, and make it even with this one, and the other: and make it even after the other, until its whole circumference is in accordance with this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the end of this suture is that your sutures of the skin which are of the leather type which are made for the skin: so that your heel is even with one side of the extremity of the skin: and that you let go of the other side on the other side, until you have completed it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper suture which Gale has mentioned.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is the explanation which Gale has mentioned, that your sutures should be made according to the manner of some of the physicians, because they collect every part to the same extent by nature: and apply the extremity of the heel to its other extremity, and the extremity of the mark to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I have said.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that the point pierce the heel close to the outer side, and that you make the point penetrate inwards only in this place: and let go of both extremities of the heel
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then withdraw the point, and make the point penetrate from the outer side to the inwards through both extremities of the heel, that is to say on both sides
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then withdraw both of them, and make them penetrate both from the inside outwards through the two other extremities of the heel which are on the opposite side
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And thus is the best manner of stitching that which requires no reminder.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is indeed the saying of Galen as well
Et dixerunt quidam.	Some have said it.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture is corrected within with two squares.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, you insert into each of the two squares a single thread: and you begin with the needle which is towards you, and make it penetrate up to the opposite edge, following the suture which is between the skins equally
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	You know that when a disruption occurs in the middle of the belly: then the suture of that is more difficult than that of the rest of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgement of the true healing of a wound is the judgement of the rest of the wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	When you follow the wound with blood, before it changes itself with air: and you reduce the intestines, and put your hand over it: then you place over the wound a layer of powdered meat
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	When the air has already altered the wound: then you place over it some unguents which are your presence, until they make pus: and the thread will fall away, and it will be consolidated by the fat, and will heal.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for this in the same way as for the healing of the rest of the wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if there are no physicians present: then you place over it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, a soft cushion: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicine in many situations, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, the time should happen when the vein communicates with the greater limbs in the lesion, then it is necessary to immerse the lancet in lukewarm water or in rose water: and place it around the circumference of the parts which are between the groin and the ankles, and under the scrota.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If it feels pain, or pricking, or decay in the intestines (for this often happens in this), then bathe it with a vinegar sponge, black and warm: especially if decay has spread in the intestines, and an opening has been made through to its cavity
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the great intestine is easier of healing: and that which is from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The small intestine, however, which is called the Jejunum, does not recover from an ulcer which happens in it throughout: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the greatness of their numbers, and because of the subtleness of its body, and because of the proximity of its nature to the nerves
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, what proceeds from the ulcer is purulent, and you follow up on it, reduce it according to your reduction which you make of the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, it has passed beyond that space, and has become black, or dark: then it is necessary to ligate it with a thread above the place which has been denatured by it, so that the blood flow does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the ulcer there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut through that which is beyond the ligament, and place two hanging threads from the lower part of the ulcer outside of it: so as to counteract its attraction, and extraction of itself in the case of the ulcer, and the emission of pus from the ulcer
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember the wound that happened in the Intestino.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When disruption happens in the Intestino and is small: then it is possible, in some people, to restore it: for I have seen that which was wounded in the middle of the belly with a lance and was old, and a fistula was made, and it went out through that and there was egestio and swelling.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I put in treatment, until I am commanded to cease in the healing of it: neither shall I abstain from continuing it until it is healed and the place is solidified.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	When I have seen that the place has been solidified, I fear that something bad may happen over the diseased part in the belly: and it did not happen to him from that bad thing.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And it remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, hopeful, and went into the bath, and exercised in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters say that when a wound happens in the Intestino and is small: then it must be bound in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And take the large-headed ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then join two lips of the wound, and put an ant on one of those which have an open bone over two lips of the wound
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When you put that over them, and bind its bone, cut off its head, join with it, and do not dissolve it
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing that until you have done as much as the size of the whole wound
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and bind the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	The head remains connected to the intestines until the intestines are eaten and restored, and it does not cause any harm to the patient.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	It is also possible to ligate the intestines with a fine thread: which has been taken from an animal's intestine and is attached to it after it has been introduced into the belly
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And you must take hold of the end of this thread from the intestine, and remove a great deal of it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then ligate the thread at its end with a fine suture
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce this thread into the belly, and join it to the intestines.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	And reduce it to a rupture
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of stitching with needles and intestines is not without risk, except with great confidence and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that which is great, broad and especially when it is in a thin intestine: then there is no skill except cunning, and its healing is not at all
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	About care for wounds and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound, or fistula when it has become old and hardened, and has become a wound, and does not consolidate, and constantly emits pus, and does not burst: then it is called universally in every member a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is according to truth a filter node, hard, white: which does not cause pain, which has the consistency of a feather of a bird: and for this reason some call it Risati, that is, feather
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And sometimes it is wet, which emits pus
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	Perhaps humidity breaks down in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	When humidity is much, it is little, large, and soft.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have said previously in the discourse concerning ulcers, that no wound which does not heal, neither is born in that flesh, is there except for one new cause.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	There is one, either because there is little blood in the body: or because of the malice of the blood: or because the flesh between the lips and the teeth is hard, hindering the birth of flesh: or because there is much pus and slime: or because the wound itself is putrid, and the matter which issues from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable for the cure: or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence: or for the property of the region itself, as it happens in Caesarea Augusta, where digestion is difficult for ailments and healing is delayed in this because of its nature: or because there is one bone, or many bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have shown you all these causes and signs and their cures with the physicians in the discourse: and it befits you to write the cure for fistula and fistula, which is done by one operation with the hand
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	You know therefore that fistula happens in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For there are fistulas which reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestines, or the bladder, or to some of the ribs: or to some of the vertebrae or to some of the compound joints: such as the hand and the foot. And there are those which arise from the proximity of the great limb to the principal limb.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	And thus these fistulas which are according to this method arise from difficult and incurable ailments, and occupation with them is laborious and ignorant
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If the depth of any fistula does not reach these places which I have mentioned: and you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to reach an understanding of it, then grasp a trial from air or iron, since the fistula runs according to its nature, and inquire about it with the fistula itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, the fistula has a twist, then investigate it with a thin lead weight
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	because the lead, with the softness of its body, alleviates around the twist
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to grasp it with a trial.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Close your hand over the fistula from its openings to its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture which closes your hand will go out through other openings and run out of the hand.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire diligently in what way it is possible for you: to know whether it is bone or nerve, and whether the fistula is long or short: or whether the fistula is one which has many openings and lies over all that, with the sum of your strength: with your question to the patient, and the sensation of pain in compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and symptoms following.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have reached all these stages, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and know that if the fistula is close and apparent, or is far from the junction with the nerve, or artery, or vein, or any place which I have mentioned to you: then grasp the fistula as I have said before, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupted blood, which is born in its opening from meat, or pus, and similar things: and care for it until it is healed
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is of great length and depth, and is according to the rule of rectitude: then it is necessary that you dissect as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then you must remove from it all its corrupt parts
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply ligatures with sharp instruments: and introduce these until you have reached the depth of the fistula which you recognized with the iron: do this as many times as necessary, until the acute medicine has eaten away everything that remains in the depth of the fistula from corruption
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore the part with the bandages which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If, however, it does not heal by this, then cauterize it as we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If, however, the cause of the fistula is bone, and you suspect this: then inquire about it, and dissect it as we have narrated: if it does not prevent you anything from the bone, or the nerve, or the principal limb, as we have said
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If, however, in it you discover bone, and there is something of corruption and blackness: then burn it out, until the corruption of it is entirely removed
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which nourishes it, until it is healed
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	Which if it does not heal, and emits pus like before: then you know that you have not reached the entire eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Discover further on this, and make an investigation of it, and dissect it with the greatest skill you can muster.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If, however, it heals, it is good: and if not, then you know that this corruption is in great depth of the body, which you have not been able to overcome
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	No force is there in that thing in the body, except that which it itself sends out.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the bone of the limb is corrupted, and you can reach it, draw it out with fine forceps which fit to it
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then you must make an incision of all of them, and do not send anything out with your hand.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If anything opposes you from making an incision, and there is no fear of error in the incision, then you must make an incision of the humors and the flesh there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed you are not prepared to extract the bone at this hour, then put over it something which will putrefy it: and send it away, until it is putrefied from the flesh and humors surrounding the bones.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And keep the wound closed so that it does not swell up.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the incision be as small as you made it in your operation
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	And put over it, if you wish, sulfur pounded with oil: or immerse it in Egyptian unguent or in some other unguent of your choice
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when the humors are putrefied and separated from the bones, the pain will cease, and their attraction will cease also
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If indeed there is a great bone, such as the shin or the thigh, and the like of them, which is corrupted, it is a great part: then cut away that part finally, until the blackness and corruption are gone from it.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then close the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If indeed that which is in it is corrupted, is a great part, and the corruption has already penetrated the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to amputate it, and cut through it entirely until the corruption has ceased: then care for it, until it is healed
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I shall tell you about the swelling which happens in the leg: in order that you may take it as an example and an aid in your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	A youth of about thirty years of age suffered pain in his leg, due to something that had moved within his body, that is, from the inside outwards, until it reached the leg, and there remained a large swelling: there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	It has been prolonged for a long time with the error of the doctors, until the swelling was opened, and many materials came out with it
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after that, his cure was completed, until the limb was bandaged, and many holes were made in it: from which all sorts of pus and moisture came out of the body
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	He was treated by many doctors for about two years, and there was no skill in their art of hand, until I came, and I washed the leg and the materials which came out of the holes were great: even all the flesh of the limb had been wasted, and its color was yellow
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	They introduced it into one of the holes, and the attempt reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the holes: and I found that they all went deep into the leg from all parts of the limb
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I proceeded accordingly, and I closed one of the holes, until I reached a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: it was rotten, discolored, and putrefying, and had a hole in it, until it had penetrated as far as the marrow
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I saw what had been detected by me, and prepared from the corrupted bone
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I concluded that there was no soundness in the bone except for that corruption, which I cut off and removed
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	I have eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I shall institute the restoration of the wound with the physicians consolidated in a wide space.
Et non est consolidatum.	It is not consolidated
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried, and I found above the first detection: and I found a continuous corruption with the bone: and I saw that it had also appeared from that corruption
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted to restore it
Et non est restauratum.	It is not restored
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I found it again above that: and I did not cease to cut the bone piecemeal, and to try to restore it: and it is not restored, until I cut from the bone almost a palm's breadth, and I extracted that with the marrow itself
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and it was not necessary for this repetition in the operation of this, and the section of itself, except for the disposition of the infirmity of the patient, and his small tolerance, and my fear of death for him: because it was happening to him in every hour from the excessive evacuation of the bad humors
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He is healed thus by complete healing: and it has become in the place of the hard bone, and a good disposition has been made in his body, and the strength has returned to him: and he has recovered his former state: and he has not suffered any discomfort in walking or sleeping ever since
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however the prominent bone in the body is fractured: then it is necessary to bind it up according to this method: and it is that you take a ligament, and bind the bone at the extremity of the prominent bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and put another ligament of a greater thickness than the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind up the limb above the flesh which is upon the bone: and stretch out its extremity, so that you may draw the flesh downwards: and you will see the flesh above the place which you wish to cut, so that it does not damage the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a stick, or a board under the lower bone in the center: because when you make this, it does not hinder that the flesh is cut through which is spoiled
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	It is necessary that the suture be above the spoiled place rather than in the concavity of the broken bone: and that it should not appear in its vision to the patient, and should cause no pain to him concerning the suture of his wound
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is spoiled and is not prominent, continue its part with its part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in the part itself: then draw out the flesh from all parts of it whole
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a stick below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then cut it from the first part where the corruption is, until the suture is completed from the other side: and let the suture be according to the length of the corruption, as we have said
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut through the spoiled joint, and cut the bone where the other side continues.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in this place except for abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the palm of the foot: then the matter is difficult to deal with.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is necessary to inquire concerning the nature of the corruption.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape the wound, and cleanse it according to whatever method you are able, and with whatever skill you can: when it does not cause you to be in contradiction to the Vein, or the Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you know that the incisors and the molars for cutting down these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their size, their flexibility, their magnitude, and their quantity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you know that these operations are significant to you above the kind of instrument which you do not know when you have studied for a long time.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the ways of this art is a testimony to the ways of knowledge: for then you will find for yourself that which is suitable for it from the instruments for all diseases.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	I am firm in the last of this chapter concerning the number of instruments which I place as examples of those which you will encounter, and the test which you will experience with others.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the molars.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of the other molars
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the other molars
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the molars is like that of the incisors, but it is broader and more flexible.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of the molars is made with the edge facing downwards.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Its arch is towards the upper part, its edge is of iron: and its handle is of boxwood, and it is made in the shape of a pyramid with the edge facing downwards
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of the cutting instruments
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	The head of this instrument is like the head of a star-shaped key: and its points are like the points of a nail.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	It does not fit unless it is rubbed against it with the head of the cutting instruments when it is broken, or when the bone is large and great
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Greatness of the wound.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Middling greatness of the wound
Forma Rasorii lati.	Small greatness of the wound.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Wound of slight concavity
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Wound of great concavity
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Wound of extreme concavity at the margins
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Wound of very small greatness, slight tension
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Wound involving a bone fragment.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Wound of great greatness also
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is like a wound caused by a knife, and the edges are like a saw: it appears in many places because of the cause of the fractured bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The greatness of the wound is in accordance with the extent of the perforation caused by the bones
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	The edges are triangular, the extremities are acute
Fit ex Indi.	Like that from India
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And in the same way, it is necessary to consider all the wounds, cuts, and saw-like injuries
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Regarding the incision of the extremities and the stitching of bones
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either by an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When you have treated the cause of the putrefaction with medicines and it does not heal: and if the putrefaction has spread to the limb without causing any effect, you must then cut off the limb until the point at which the putrefaction stops. Thus the patient is saved from death or from the greater defect of the limb
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this is that the limb becomes pale, until it turns black: for fire burns it, or it becomes putrified after it has become black. Until such putrefaction has spread throughout the body
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Properly therefore when the incision is made, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from a blow which has struck some of the veins: such as a scorpion's sting, and spiders, and worms, and things of that kind.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If there is corruption, or the blow has struck at the extremity of the finger, then incise the finger and not the space of the corruption, so that it reaches until the remaining hand
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then incise from the root of the bone, and not the space of the corruption, until it reaches the wrist bone
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it comes to that, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption has passed, and you see it around the elbow: then that is the mark of the disease.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And as for treatment beyond this, it is the quantity of the remedy.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And do the same with the foot, when the corruption comes to the finger, then incise it at one of the joints: and if it reaches the heel bone, then incise the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it comes to the knee, then incise the thigh at the knee joint
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	When the corruption has gone beyond the knee, then it is not in it, except for amputation, and leave the diseased limb to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And as for the mode of incising the limb, or leaving it, it is like this, that you string the ligaments below, which you wish to incides: and string the other ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And stretch out one ligament downwards: and stretch out the other ligament upwards
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is separated
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it either advances or retreats.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	Therefore, one must take from all parts of the wound the amount of linen that does not touch the healthy area: and when it has advanced, the wound becomes more inflamed and the swelling becomes greater.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, blood flows inwards during the operation, then cauterize the place quickly: or put over it some powder that absorbs blood
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medicine until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bandage the wounded limb with the bandage that is suitable for it, and care for it until it heals
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened in my foot, that is what I tell you
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened in my foot during a journey, with a burning sensation that assimilated with the fire: and the corruption first occurred in my finger, until the whole foot was affected
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	He therefore went away from it by himself after he had cut away the corruption from the limb because of the pain and the burning sensation: and he put it at the juncture and it healed
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And when a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred in the thumb of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me and I attempted to recover the swelling with the methods which I use on the other patients after I had treated his body: and the swelling did not disappear, but it began to advance to another finger. And the corruption spread to the hand
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to amputate his hand: and I did not do it, hoping that the swelling would subside: and I feared that if I made an incision in his hand he would die
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the force of the man was great over the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	When he had given up hope of me, he returned to his land: and he came to me again because he had heard that I had been cured. And he threw himself upon my hand whole: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And do not heed this narration except as an aid concerning that which has fallen from the kind of this ailment: and as a signification which signifies, and according to how it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Of the care of joints, and the quality of blistering with the physicians.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When swelling happens in some limb with pain, and the space of the swelling is prolonged, until it makes collection of the healing: then it is broken, or pierced, and what is in it is removed from the healing, and the place which was swelling is left as though it were a hollow space: and the skin which is over it is like a thin membrane which has been stretched: and it does not reach the end in its corruption, neither does it reach the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula, until its space is prolonged, until corruption is made in some part of the limb, then it is called a Fistula, or swelling
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its care is that you cut the whole skin as it is twisted: and especially when it is stretched thin, like a membrane: and trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and this does not result from this corruption: and if there is thickening in the skin from the flesh, then cure it with blistering: and it is like considering the Sinus
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is great, and the pus which comes out of it has a foul smell: then blister it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and resin, equal parts, mixed together: and boil them over a fire, until the medicine boils: and bring in the spissitude of honey
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from this what is necessary: dissolve it with water and honey, and instill it with vinegar: and tighten its orifice, and send the medicine into it for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure: do this for several days until the sinus is healed, and the stench is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is instilled with vinegar and water, when it is not in the presence of this medicine: take vinegar of wood ashes, or vinegar from the wood of ilic: and sprinkle it over the water
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then rest it, and instill it with this, until you are confident that the sinus has been evacuated
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, neither vinegar or water, then instill it with water and honey, to which something of ground cinnamon has been added
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or instill it with honey and wine mixed together, for honey has the property of healing and softening: and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in it
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has passed away: then instill it with something that makes new flesh grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is good to take from alum of Daphne: and dissolve it with rose water and wine: or instill it with some medicine, and anoint with others, of whose properties are written in the treatise on unguents.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice of the sinus is narrow, in which the cannula of the syringe will not pass: then widen it with a small iron: or put in the cavity something softened in Egyptian unguent, or in aloes, until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	If the orifice is wide, join its lips together with suture and discharge the amount which enters the fistula without adding.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	If pus flows from the orifice, elevate it to the upper parts: then dry it in the recess where it is, so that it flows downwards: for pus, when contained in depth, hinders the generation of flesh in it
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible to dry the fistula below, try to prepare the limb with a preparation which will allow the pus to flow out easily as it is prepared
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try that nothing of the pus remains in it: and take solidifying medicines which are placed over the sign, suitable for this purpose.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a layer of linen.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the linen be of such quantity as to cover the whole fistula.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut through in the middle of the orifice of the fistula with scissors, widening the orifice of the fistula somewhat.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread out fine sponges over the other linen, according to the size of the hole: and put it over the fistula in a long position away from the orifice of the fistula, so as to relieve the discharge of pus from it: and do not make the linen too large, except after a few days or so once
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But he who is over the orifice of the fistula should move in every hour, so that what accumulates in it from the pus may go out: and you will know whether it is much or little, digested or indigested
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And thus consider again the place of the fistula itself, whether the master of the house feels pain there, or whether there is pain there, or whether there is swelling there, or not
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When the remedy has been applied in this way, and you see that the material which exudes from the orifice of the Sinus has ceased, then you know that the Sinus is adhered, or is close to adhesion: then you must solve it in the palm of your hand, or on the third day. And when you have solved it, then change the bandage and renew the unguentum.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if it continues to exude from the Sinus for a long space of time with a fine discharge, then do not despair of adhesion, for its healing approaches, because there are men who are slow to generate flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrariwise to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if it continues to exude from the Sinus for many days, pus which is indigested, then you know that the Sinus is not adhered
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, however, the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then add to the medication, truly the physicians will make the medicine moist in its substance and dry in its nature: like unguentum dyafinicon, when added to it makes the excess moist.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last thing which is to be done, that is to take unguentum dyafinicon and dissolve it with rosewater, and return over the old liquid equal in quantity to its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with this and use it thus.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	It does the same thing as this, when it is not present there, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, until it is consumed, and you use it with this
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloes, and olibanum: mix them all together, and grind that up over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then smear upon the bandage, and bind it over the Sinus: and smear with the honey which you have boiled until it is consumed: and grind over it the spices, and put upon the bandage, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	When such aristolochia, long roots of lilies of the heavens, lilies, herb seeds, and centaurea are administered together,
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	When these simples are used together, either simple or combined, and there is bleeding, let there be pounded salt on the wound, and use it on the pulse.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the condition of the sinus persists and does not heal with this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depth: either that it makes an imprint on the bones, or on the tough parts of the limb, or the ligaments: then treat it by fistula, as mentioned before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Concerning the care of panaritium and nails that have become detached, and the incision of the digit added, and the section of it.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 101.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritium is a swelling that occurs under the nail of the thumb or finger, or perhaps in the other digits.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When it persists, and is neglected, it becomes inflamed and pus is emitted, until the root of the nail is corroded: and perhaps the whole nail is broken, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, and there is a foul odor: and the digit becomes swollen and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you treat it as we have said, and it does not improve: then it is necessary to cut off the entire superabundance that remains from the nail with a knife
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then burn the nail afterwards
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	A cautery is useful for these things when the iron is cold.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the nails have become loose and penetrate the flesh: then you must place radium under the nail at an angle so that it will touch the flesh, and push it up: and cut the flesh easily, and put on what remains of the flesh from the physicians who have burned and corroded it until it is gone
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, corruption has already set in the bone, then it is necessary to cut away the bone and extract it: for it will not heal as long as the corrupt part remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption advancing in a finger, then cut through it at one joint, as has been mentioned previously concerning its reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, an attrition or percussion should happen to the nail, and there is pain in this, then it is necessary to bleed the diseased part at first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula from above downwards to the edge.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And take care, lest the cutting should reach the flesh under the nail, for thereby you will cause the addition of pain to the diseased part, and that is the cause of the rotting of the flesh in that place
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which sits upon the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger which is born among the hands of men, perhaps is entirely fleshy: perhaps there is in some of them a bone, and perhaps in that is the nail: and some of them are born in the root of the joint, or that is the origin of them in some part of the finger
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	He who is born in some part of the finger does not move: and he who is born near the joint of the finger, perhaps does move
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	He who is born of flesh is easily cut away
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, as you would cut away the nail with a wide spatula
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The treatment of the condition whose origin is in the root of the junction is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Avoid therefore incision of the same.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that case where it originates in the finger at the end of the bones, then it is necessary to cut through the flesh in a circular fashion from the beginning of the bone down to the bone itself
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	And then cut the bone with one saw that fits to it
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it heals
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Consolidation however which happens to the finger at the joint, often happens either by natural cause of the man, that is, it is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from burning of fire, and the like.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is necessary therefore to separate that consolidation, until the finger returns to its natural shape
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then put between the bones ligatures, or soaked sponges in boiled oil: so that they do not solidify too quickly, and separate the bones: or put between the bones a thin sheet of lead, until the place is consolidated according to what is necessary
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And in the same way if consolidation happens to any finger with the palm, then dry up that consolidation, according to what is prepared and convenient for the figure of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	¶ On the Incision of Wounds.
Caput XCII.	Chapter XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are veins which are involved, large, full of melancholic superfluities which happen in various parts of the body: and most of the time their event is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who are engaged in travel and work, and those who carry burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is necessary therefore to manage the swelling of the body from black bile somewhat by evacuation.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then the physician shall take the patient's pulse with ease.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	Treatment of these with iron is in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of these is to cauterize and draw out black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	The other is to raise the vein and draw out all of it.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of these is in this way.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	The patient should be bathed with warm water, and the thick blood should be resolved until it becomes like mud
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the limb of the patient from the upper part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with oil
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three wide sections
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise up, that is, draw out blood from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and from the top pour it out so that the patient receives the phlebotomy at the beginning
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the blood until there remains just as much as is needed for the treatment, and as the patient can tolerate the pain of the wound
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind the limb: and command him to abstain from food that generates black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are filled, and this will be good for the patient
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of these is in this way
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	If there are many hairs in the limb, shave them off
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse the limb in a bath: or cauterize the limb in the leg with warm water, until it turns red, and swell the veins: or perform an exercise of force, if there is no bath present, until the limb is warmed up
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin in the direct vicinity of the area to be cut: either at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with scissors, and scrape the area thoroughly, until sensation is restored: and it is when sensation returns that you know that you have rubbed away the redness to the blackness
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When the blood has drained from the wound, you know that the wound has bled as much as it will.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce beneath it radium, until it rises and comes out of the skin: suspend it with a cautery needle, fine hair
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry the other area nearby for three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the area, until sensation returns.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise the area with the radium as you did before, and suspend it with another needle as you did before.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another area, or several areas, if you wish
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift up, and make the final incision at the heel
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove the wound from the area which is above the wound
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	Do all this, until you have removed the wound from the upper section, or from all the higher sections, until when they are all gone: then make the incision.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if you do not manage to remove it by lifting and pulling: then introduce a needle with a strong thread, and tie the wound, and pull it out: or introduce radium under it: and move your hand over the whole area, until it comes out
Et caue, ne incidatur.	Take care not to make any further incisions
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	If it happens, it is difficult for thee to lift him up again, and it enters over the patient from this document.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have pulled out all of it: then put over the place of the wound a soaked bandage of wool in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for him, until he is healed.</start_of_turn>
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a twist to which the parts are twisted, and is not as we have said according to the rule: then it is necessary to find over the vein on all parts the twist of the twist itself.</start_of_turn
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend the vein with hooks, until you have lifted up all of it: and beware at your incision on the vein above that you do not cut the vein, or wound it: for it is difficult to lift up or extract it.</start_of_turn>
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Be prudent in this matter.</start_of_turn>
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of the wound which heals the vein.</start_of_turn
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of the closed wound.</start_of_turn
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It has no curvature like other veins, neither is it acute at the extremities, as it does not wound the vein: and it is of great flexibility, gentle: for if it were slight, it would wound the vein by its flexibility: or if it were of great thickness, as we have said.</start_of_turn
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the thigh vein.</start_of_turn
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.</start_of_turn>
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the thighs in warm lands, like Alizegi, and the land of Arabs, and in dry and warm lands, few in number, that is, in which no herb or tree grows.</start_of_turn
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the limbs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its generation is from putrefaction which occurs under the skin, as for example worms and serpents within the body, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And a sign of the commencement of this event is swelling in the limb with heat
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the site becomes wet
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to depart from that wet place, as if from the root of a plant, or an animal
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore it appears from that extremity, then it is necessary to cover over the lead with the thumb, which weighs a drachma, up to two drachmas and a node: and let the suspended lead go from the limb.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Every time therefore that anything comes out from that, cover it with lead and tie it
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged for a long time, then cut off a part of it, and cover the remainder
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut through the root before all of it has gone out
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut through it, it contracts, and enters the flesh: and it makes the swelling worse, and generates putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to extract it gently, and gradually, until all of it has gone out of the body: and from this vein comes out in some people which is as long as five palms and ten fingers long
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And indeed it has come to me, because it has gone out of the body for twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If, however, it happens that you are seized in the hour of your medication: then introduce radium into the cavity of its body, and perforate it through a long opening, with the body, until all that is in it from the material is evacuated: and administer putrefaction of the place with physicians for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the aftercare of the wound.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And thus the vein often has many branches, especially when it appears in the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many outlets, and branches go out from every outlet.</start_of_turn>
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Care for it accordingly, as we said before, and as is usual.</start_of_turn>
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	With regard to the section above the worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine disease.</start_of_turn
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIV.</start_of_turn>
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in this land among us bovine disease: because it frequently happens to cattle, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.</start_of_turn
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	It goes through the whole body, ascending and descending: and is perceptible to the sense during its walking from limb to limb, until it ruptures wherever it ruptures in the skin at the place, and comes out.</start_of_turn
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of some humors.</start_of_turn
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and serpents appear, that is to say, roundworms and tapeworms in the belly.</start_of_turn
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they are harmful.</start_of_turn
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it itself goes into the body, and ascends to the head, and comes to the place: then perhaps it opens there, and comes out, and destroys the eye: and this happens frequently.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When the will to care for him and extract him exists, it is not done except alongside his walking and the perception of his sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore that strings be passed both above and below him with strong ligation
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over him and extract him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is found deep in the flesh and you do not find it: then place over the place a cautery with fire until it dies
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And more than that which is feared is the corruption of his eye, as we have said
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If indeed you see him going toward the head near the eye, then string under it with a strong suture above the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over him and extract him
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	It is necessary that the patient be treated with the purification of his body, with physicians resolving the harmful humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Regarding the incision above the navel of Nakir
Caput XCV.	Chapter XCVI.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in some parts of the body: then it changes from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	I myself have seen it, as I have told you
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a woman who was sick in some corner of the house
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And I found her arm swollen and saw a swelling of the marrow in the bone of the arm
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw another swelling grow with a worm, like a worm, ascending to his shoulder more quickly than is possible: so that it was like silver going from place to place
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain has receded from that place and is fixed in the arm.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then remain one hour, and it runs through the rest of the body until it reaches the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it was returning throughout its whole body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I marvel at the swiftness of its change from limb to limb
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed I did not believe that such an illness could be seen in this way until now
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	But I have seen many who have found the pain change from limb to limb, and I have not seen it with my eyes in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	I do not believe this, except that it is because of the moisture of the women of this district: hence hence appears the swelling to be moved about
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	It is necessary that it should not appear in delicate persons and humid bodies, hidden by their secret parts.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you see it with your eyes that the pain has returned: then if it appears to you like this, then grasp above and below with more force: and dry above until the swelling has gone away: and cauterize the place.</start_of_turn>
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your eyes: then take care of it with the evacuation of the body and with the application of fomentatives with poultices of rue and sage, and similar things.</start_of_turn>
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	(The text continues with a description of treating another medical condition.)</start_of_turn>
Caput XCVI.	(The page number is omitted.)</start_of_turn>
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are varied according to their kinds and according to the locations from which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their variety is indeed great: for some have large teeth, others have small, some are concave and others are convex
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And those which have tongues
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And those which have stars
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	These are varied according to the members from which they fall, in two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or else the members are from those which are concave in principle, such as the brain, the heart, the spleen, the lung, the kidneys, the intestines, the bladder, and similar parts
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any one of these members, and you see signs of death, which I shall tell you afterwards, then it is necessary to extract that arrow from the body, for death follows its trajectory in many positions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when you do not see these bad signs, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it and care for the wound
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	From the signs of the brain, when it falls in that arrow, and pierces the bone, and comes out at the surface of the brain, it is: because from that arise soda that causes vomiting, swelling, vertigo, redness of the eyes, inflation, redness of the tongue, spasm, and mixture of the intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out of the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps the voice is lost, and the will is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And comes out from the wound a white moisture like pus
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it comes out like the moisture of meat.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If, however, this sign appears, then abstain from treatment and draw out the arrow if it does not come out by itself.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow lodged in the gut are: when it is close to the left breast: and it feels as though it is fixed in something hard, not in something soft.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow is moved like the beating of a pulse: and it runs out with black blood from the wound
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following this there is cold extremity, cold sweat, and fainting
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	You know, therefore, that death approaches with doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	The sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung, is the escape of bloody foam from the wound: and the swelling which follows the chest, subsides and changes the colour of the patient.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And the great and high spirit expires: and it seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If an arrow falls into the diaphragm, which is in the chest: then it is near the lower ribs: and it causes a great sigh with pain, with breathing difficulty, with gasping: and all the arms hang down
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach: then perhaps it comes out of the wound with some undigested food
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly and is fixed in it: something of stool, or urine, or intestine which has been ruptured comes out of the wound
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is no hope in the treatment of this, neither in the extraction of the arrow
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something goes out from it to the outside, and the pain is more severe over the patient: then you know that this is deadly
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining members, as the face, neck, belly, spatula, assistant, dorsal spines, fork, hip, thigh, and those similar to them, are treated according to various arrangements: when neither an arrow nor a nerve is found.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	I also say concerning these arrows that you must understand by that your care.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because I believe that the arrow is hidden by the swelling of the eye or the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore I extract it from the other side under the fatty substance of his ear: and he was healed, and no wound remained in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew who had it in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was hidden, and I did not find its tip until I had broken its bow: it was a large arrow of the Turks, with lead, in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	He was healed therefore, and no evil happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the belly of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	It was an Arabian arrow, and these are those which have ears
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	And I found it between two ribs: and it was buried deep in his belly
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was careful with it until I had extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another which had been buried in his bowels: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After these things happened to him for thirty days, and there was no change in his condition concerning the arrow, we believed that he would recover: and we treated him, and extracted the arrow: and he was healed, and no evil happened to him
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And immediately he who was struck by the arrow in his back, and the bone was consolidated above it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	And after seven years, the arrow came out from the root of his thigh bone.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And immediately she who was struck by the arrow in her belly, and the bone was consolidated above it, and the arrow remained inside her: and no change appeared in her condition from her former habits, and the woman did not suffer from any aftereffects of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And immediately another man who was struck by an arrow on his face, and the bone was consolidated, and the arrow remained, without causing him much pain: and similar things happened to many others
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from the king's face, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, and which had inclined towards the right side below: and the arrow was completely hidden
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called to his care after the arrow wound for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the arrow wound quite tight above the bone
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I asked him [the patient] whether he felt any pain under the skin, and he himself confirmed that he felt pain and swelling from the right side around the wound
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that this was the mark of the arrow's exit wound.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I plastered the place with absorbent and adhesive plaster, trusting that the wound would heal, and that the sign of the arrow would disappear on the surface: and it did not happen in the place of the wound as if the arrow had followed its course.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I continued to pack the wound with plaster for many days: and it did not happen that the accident occurred, and the bone consolidated in the meantime: and he remained unable to extract the arrow until one day he felt the arrow within his nose
Et narrauit mihi illud.	He told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	And he related to me that.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Moreover, in the opening of the wound by means of that acute medicine, until it became visible to us the extremity of the arrow: and we passed over that period of time about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	When the wound had healed, and we were able to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not emerge: then we did not desist from boring under the nail, and devised ways to manage above it like skilled people, until we put an end to it on a certain day with forceps which had been made crooked, as it happened in the end of the chapter, until we extracted the arrow from it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	The wound was restored.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the physicians say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	We restored it, and the wound became firm and healed completely: and nothing remained of the illness.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the kind of extraction of arrows which I have seen: so that you may know the rule and the signification of it concerning this matter which I have not mentioned
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended by the narration: neither does this book comprehend them, nor does the skillful craftsman compare them with little to much: and with regard to that which is present, there is little of it, while that which is absent is much; and he has found a new operation and an instrument among the descent of these things in this art when they arise
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the members in which they are fixed, except according to two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place from whence it came in.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or otherwise from the opposite side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which goes out from whence it came in, or that is a bow proceeding in a fleshy place: and it is attracted and goes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not obey the exit at the hour when it fell: then it is necessary that you omit it for some days, until the carrion that is around it is putrefied: and the attraction of it will be diminished, and its egress will cease
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And in like manner if it is fixed in bone, and does not obey you at the exit, then omit it also for some days: and do it again every day with the attraction and motion until it comes out
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you at the exit after days: then it is necessary that you perforate around the bow in the very bone from all sides with a fine thread, until the bow be increased
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out, and draw out the thing itself.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the bow is fixed in the head of the bone, and is proceeding in one of the ventricles of the brain, and appears from the diseased parts some of those things which I have mentioned: then abstain from the attraction of the bow and draw it out, until it be equal to its former state after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the bow persists to the soft parts, then its decay will not be prolonged.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the bow is not fixed except in the body of the bone, and does not penetrate as far as the soft parts: and remains diseased for some days, and nothing happens to it from those things: then think of the attraction of the bow and its extraction
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If however it is fixed above, and does not obey you in the attraction: then manage the surrounding of the bow as I have said: then care for the place, until it be healed
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow is hidden in a body part and is concealed and hidden from sight: then inquire concerning it with a hook.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you suspect that it is there, then draw it out with some instrument that is suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you are unable to see beyond it because of the constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow in its depth: and there is no bone, no nerve, or blood vessel there: then find above it until the wound is widened, and only then can the arrow be extracted.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If there are veins which are held by it, then loosen the flesh fixed in the wound from all sides, by all means which you can think of, and contort them, if it is not possible to remove the flesh from the fracture of the ears, and the twisting of the ears, until it escapes
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you are administering the extraction of the arrow from whatever place it is in, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps to all parts, until you make the arrow escape: and with the last little force, so that the arrow does not break, and so that its extraction is easier for you
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you are unable to remove it at one time, then leave it for a few days, until the surrounding parts have become putrid
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the process: for it will be useful to you that it does not cause the flow of blood. Then administer what we have said about the care in its chapter: and guard your virtue from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer skill in every way that you can in order to extract the arrow: and do it with ease, and tranquility, or slowly, and firmly, as I have told you
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do this while you are pulling out the arrow, so that the patient is like the image of the arrow as it is in the case of the arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	How great is the blessing.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If this is not possible, then do what you can from the things that are possible to you.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	An arrow which proceeds from the opposite side, or which proceeds from that to the exterior, either makes a swelling at the end of the arrow which is near the skin, and brings up pus: dry therefore over the pus, and cut according to the quantity which they take in that force-ps
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw out the arrow: for itself becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If indeed it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the circumference, until you press the arrow into the bone, and expand it: then draw it out
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days: then try it again, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow-wood is in that, then push it out with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If the wood breaks, and you wish to administer a push: then introduce an instrument with a concave edge, so that the concavity of the instrument may enter into the head of the arrow: then push out the arrow with the instrument itself
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is concave, then push out the arrow with an instrument entering into itself

Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of the arrow as it pleases you which will agree with this

If the arrow is falling in the chest, or in the belly, or in the gut, or on the side: and it is close to that which you touch with your finger, and it is possible to cut over the wound: then cut over the wound, and burn from the navel, or nerve, and draw out the arrow.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then, if necessary, apply the poultice to the wound, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	This is the form of forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The extremities are like the beak of a bird, made of iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not recoil
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.

Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The handle of this forceps is concave like the beak of a bird: so as to protect the entrance of the arrow into itself and the driving force of it

Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done in two ways.</start_of_turn
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by grasping with the thumb as with a phlebotome of Myrtle: or by olive oil to the point of thinness: or by cutting with a knife, which is Alnesil.</start_of_turn
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is suitable for cutting.</start_of_turn
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And there are broad and narrow species according to the width of the veins and the tension of their form. The phlebotomy of the Myrtle is broad like water.</start_of_turn

Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomus is of smaller width and has a finer extremity.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the puncture of slender veins which contain thin yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Concerning the puncture of veins according to Albucasis
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	Basilicae, however, which is one of the three main veins for phlebotomy, is deemed an instrument.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the swellings which are under the jaw and the throat, from the chest following the belly, and the groin: and it is suitable for the phlebotomist because it is above the risk of causing damage to an artery
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If, therefore, he is mistaken and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will damage the artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary not to puncture the phlebotomist with the phlebotome: rather let him be dry like Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If it does not appear visibly, then one must seek it out elsewhere, or ask about it, or take one of its branches: or perform the phlebotomy in another place, such as the elbow pit
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is itself visible, and let the phlebotome be dry like that of Anesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish to perform phlebotomy upon it itself, then you must beforehand grasp the arm tightly, so that you may know the place, until you recognize the place of the pulse
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark upon the place with a scar, afterwards the arm, and dry the vein with a concave section of the phlebotome like that of Alnesil, as we have said
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware lest the puncture should slip from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you go, with your strings of the ligature, the inflation in the place which you marked with the cautery, then that inflation is an inflation of the artery: you must therefore do so.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	When you go [i.e., perform surgery], with your strings of the ligature, the inflation in the place which you marked with the cautery, then that inflation is an inflation of the artery: you must therefore do so.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Therefore do so, and place your finger over the said long space, then withdraw your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If blood is therefore separated (for it is much more severed), then string the arm, and let it go: and let the patient beware of its movement: and be over its fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for a few days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If however blood is not severed, and it increases to you: and it does not appear to you in your moment of need, then cut the artery if you see it
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities recoil, and blood is severed.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the edge of the flesh, and find the vein: take the middle one, and string it over the place of the narrowest constriction, with the ligature and the threads until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is severed, that is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then care for it as for that from which the recollection of the bleeding powder flows: and the cutting of blood in that is not difficult in many positions, because of the smallness of the wound, and the possibility of ligating from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Of phlebotomy of the vein of the Fuscus
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The vein of the Fuscus is suitable for phlebotomy, because it carries blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because it is composed of the branch of the Basilica and the branch of the Cephalic, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	It is fitting for the phlebotomist to be above the fear of phlebotomy, for under it lies a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If, therefore, the phlebotomist adds in the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, it happens in this that he falls into a trance, and the healing of his case becomes difficult, and perhaps does not heal at all
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears to be connected with the sense of touch.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If, however, it is hidden in some people, and is slight, and is not seen: then it is necessary that you should perform phlebotomy with caution, sectioning with Alnesil, and take the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If there are two nerves between which there is a space, then find the space in its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the nerve of the head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomies of the nerve of the head are useful, because they draw blood from the head, and confer to eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein alone, if you will, that you should perform phlebotomy with the olive oil needle, or with the myrtle needle: because it is safer for the veins of all, because there is no artery, nor nerve under it
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	But it is fitting to you to know concerning phlebotomy that you should take hold of the head only with the first puncture, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm if it is not found with the first blow, as it will return with subsequent phlebotomies.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Perhaps sometimes in some people the swelling subsides when it is not phlebotomized in the first blow, but it does not harm that swelling in anything.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Of the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in its practice.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of Phlebotomy and its associated accidents are such that you must consider their rectification.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, you must know that Phlebotomy is not to be used except in the conservation of health, and the preservation of life, and the avoidance of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And as for the veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalica, and the Fusca, and the Basilica, these are suitable for Phlebotomy
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And as for the time of the year when Phlebotomy should be performed, it is best in the beginning of spring after the feast, in summer, and in autumn, and in winter after the completion of the harvest, when there are signs of fullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	It should be performed on the first or third day after the three hours have passed
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomy for diseases does not have a fixed time: but when there is convenience and necessity for it, at night or day, at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	It is not permitted to perform Phlebotomy on children until they are at least fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Neither should Phlebotomy be performed on a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor on the elderly who have passed their sixtieth year
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When anyone wishes to undergo Phlebotomy for any reason: it is necessary to empty the intestines beforehand with a mild laxative, if there is much stool retained: so that they do not draw out harmful matter from the intestines towards the principal parts during Phlebotomy.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Phlebotomy should not be performed on a patient who is suffering from nausea, or who is intoxicated, or who has consumed alcohol: until these symptoms have passed from the body.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy are unaffected by hydropisis.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy are unaffected by hydropisis.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Neither the infirm nor the healthy are unaffected by hydropisis. Consider carefully the condition of the humors before attempting treatment; if blood is thick with food and drink, and if the physicians are present: in such a case it is possible for them to do it.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Consider carefully the condition of the humors before attempting treatment; if blood is thick with food and drink, and if the physicians are present: in such a case it is possible for them to do it.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	Consider carefully the condition of the humors before attempting treatment; if blood is thick with food and drink, and if the physicians are present: in such a case it is possible for them to do it. And perform phlebotomy in the chest, around the third day, as we have said: and endeavor to evacuate the belly of all harmful things: such as envy, anger, and fear: and from all bodily things, such as labor, pain, and excess, and such like these.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And make your food fragrant with things which are customary among men, such as spices, perfumes, and delights, and like these in quantity as is possible
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	And let the phlebotomist sit above the ankle, which is higher than the ankle of the phlebotomist: then draw out his arm and wipe it with the hand of the phlebotomist twice, or thrice
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then bind the ligament with a bandage, and hold it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the restraint be moderate, for when the restraint is too tight, or through excess in the restraint, then it hinders the course of the blood: or in softening, then it hinders the course of the blood also
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the stricture it is necessary that the phlebotomist should move his hand towards the inside together with the thumb, until the veins become full, and their filling is perceived by sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist should withdraw the vein with a slight pull, as before.</start_of_turn>
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his index finger of his left hand over the vein at the place where the phlebotomy is to be made, slightly: so that the vein does not slip away, and the percussion should be set.</start_of_turn
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For from the veins is more like a fleeing cord at the phlebotomy: and from the inside is what is filled with air: and when you place the phlebotomy over the vein, it contracts under the phlebotomy, and the phlebotomist is thrown back, and the vein is not opened by the phlebotomy: and if it is opened, it is a stricture: because of this, therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist should be firm, and be solicitous in all these matters.</start_of_turn>
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he lays down the phlebotomy.</start_of_turn
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If thus the vein is opened from the inside, then it is good.</start_of_turn
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it with another vein slightly under or over that one: if the place does not yield.</start_of_turn
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	And if it yields, or if the patient is weak, then let it go on the first or second day: and do not tie the ligament.</start_of_turn
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed it will draw out the clot.</start_of_turn
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Neither should you introduce a sponge.</start_of_turn>
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.</start_of_turn
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or blood runs slowly: then take care that the amount of blood which escapes does not exceed what is desired. Then repeat the bloodletting in the same place according to the rule, and add a little more to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	Do it with speed, before the place is closed. For the closed place is in many men at the time of the operation itself
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see that the thing is already closed, do not go over it any more, for that will not excuse you before the lord.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something of the fat of oil upon it: because it will soothe the running of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	It is better in this place than pure oil, and than any other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And do the same with the fat of oil in all your bloodlettings, which you do against the running of the blood: and make it become like tyriaca alfarach and sage, when you put some of it upon the place
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	The blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If it happens at the time of bloodletting that the clot is great, for it often happens to those who are not skilled in bloodletting except for a small opening, then take care and put upon the place a sponge wet with water and salt, warmed up slightly: and keep it for an hour: for it will dissolve
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has gone out of the vein, with the complement of the hand, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If anything black or yellow remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm: and if you wish, put upon it something of aloe or myrrh of resolvers, or something of the juice of mint, that is, camomile or something like that.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	Many wounds occur at the ankles and knees among the phlebotomists of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Place your hand over the area being compressed; if you find softness there, the swelling is bad
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, put something over it as we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood flows from the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a compress with something that has styptic properties to stop the bleeding at the source
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the rest with the other treatment until it heals
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to draw out every man from blood in proportion to his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color of the blood on the wound
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For blood that is black, then let it go out until it turns red: and in like manner if you see it thick: then let it go until it becomes thin: and in like manner if it is acute: then let the sharpness pass away from it
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and indigent in bloodletting to use one at a time, so that he increases the phlebotomy of one and is wide in that one: and in him who is weak, the contrary is true
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract it in small amounts, and that the puncture be strict: and it is better that it be administered in phlebotomy of one than by puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and from the cutting of nerves: and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy by breadth and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And whoever has been accustomed to persist with phlebotomy during fainting spells should before phlebotomy give the patient a spoonful of honey mixed with water of pomegranate: or vinegar, if he is feverish: and draw from him in three or four amounts
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	If the complexion is frozen, then before performing a phlebotomy, take bread infused in myrrh syrup, or in scented honey syrup with spices, or in scented oil.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If during a phlebotomy syncope should occur, due to the excessive flow of blood: then it is necessary to take in the vessel water of meat and a mild scented syrup: and let it be flavored with caraway and linseed, and cover the chest with these. And do all that we have said in the chapter on syncope concerning evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to remove his arm and restore his blood slowly: must take that from which the phlebotomy has been performed because of the great evacuation, and that is because of its weakness, so that it slowly restores the blood in quantity equal to the degree of weakness in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wishes to remove his arm and restore his blood slowly, and his body is strong: then let him do so after seven or nine hours of the first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body in the opposite direction of its decline: must do so on the second or third day
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much hot and acute blood, and which causes fever: must be driven out of it with one vessel, and a great quantity of blood should be drawn from it: and the opening should be prolonged until syncope occurs: after which time you must maintain all the conditions of the phlebotomy, and put your hand over the pulse of the blood-vessel, so that no further syncope should occur.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Many times this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and neglectful.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not proper when one wishes to restore the arm and restore the blood, when the orifice of the vessel is closed, and there is difficulty in the flow of blood, as it may happen too soon because of excessive speed, and the wound is extended too quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	It is bad that it should be delayed, nay rather let it go, until the phlebotomy be done the second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	When the blood has coagulated in the opening of the vein, remove it with the greatest attention, and pour upon it some salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And pour upon it some aloes of aloes, or alum, and compress it gently, until the blood has drained out
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein has been opened, then let it go, and do not press it, until the swelling has subsided
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	When necessity demands to evacuate the blood a second time, and this is not forbidden, then either perform the phlebotomy above the location, or in the arm or in another vein altogether
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The veins of the arm are to be phlebotomized at the cubital fossa and the elbow, when they cannot be found, because they are hidden, for they are composed of bones.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is that the patient dips his hand into warm water, until the hand becomes red and the vein becomes visible again.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then bind it above with a ligature of moderate tension
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then perform the phlebotomy in a transverse direction gradually, not laterally, and not too deeply: and let the opening be wide, and your phlebotomy should be as near to the edge of the wound as possible
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the discharge of blood is forbidden, then dip the hand once more into warm water, and let the blood flow into the water, until you have accomplished your purpose
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If indeed you are in the summer days, then you are excused from the dipping of the hand into the warm water
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	Much of the blood course is placed in warm water in winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	Phlebotomy of this vein is more beneficial than all the others, because there is neither a pulsatile vein nor a nerve under it
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the right hand is useful for treating liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	The quality of the phlebotomy is that you tie the vein with a thread or your finger, after you have introduced the vein into the warm water, until the vein swells and you can feel the cold sensation
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then the phlebotomy is completed by cutting across the vein.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut the vein completely, it will not cause it any harm in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And let us preserve, that you do not cut off your hand with the phlebotomy
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under this are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return the hand to the warm water, and let the blood flow out of it
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return the hand to the warm water, the blood clots in the opening of the vein and prevents its course.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have taken out the amount of blood necessary, then put on the vein oil and salt: so that it does not clot too quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And in the same way you must do with every strict limb
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The remedy for the phlebotomy of the left hand is: because it is useful for treating spleen ailments: and in the phlebotomy of this, do as you did in the second equally
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The saphenous veins are useful for treating ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as stomach ailments, retention of menstrual blood, kidney weakness, ulcers of the buttocks and thighs of old age, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that it introduces the diseased limb into hot water: and makes above it friction, until the veins bubble forth: and binds above the junction of the limb with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	The veins are located at the heel, appearing under the thumb: and are extracted from that on the face of the foot of many limbs.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	The phlebotomy is therefore done in the greater branch of the limb, or at the heel in its collection: because that is better and safer
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If the phlebotomy is done on the face of the foot, then it causes damage from the nerves that are under it over the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy above that from which the phlebotomy is made, as if you wish to cut through it: and let the phlebotomy be of Nile
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the discharge of blood is prohibited, then repeat the limb in hot water: and let the blood flow out in the limb until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	But if the vein is mistaken in the first attempt, then repeat with the phlebotomy to the upper parts, for the place is safe, and does not often cause harm, when you cut from the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And in the same way as the other vein of the foot is equal.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The veins of the sciatica are located at the heel from the side of the heel bone
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	The purpose of the phlebotomy is for the relief of the pain of the ankle, when it is because of the hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that it introduces the diseased limb into a bath, and makes haste: and ties the limb from the side of the ankle up to the heel for four fingers, with a fine long bandage: for it does not appear except for that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When the patient appears, then the phlebotomy is performed according to whatever is possible for the patient, or according to the passage of blood: and it is better either to make the incision or to perform the section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The place of the vein is more beneficial, and it is hidden in many men.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear to the senses in any way: then the phlebotomy is performed on some branch of it, and that which appears at the back of the foot and is adjacent to the heel: and you should prick from nerves, and cause blood to flow out in the quantity that you desire
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the tight dressing, and place over the site of the phlebotomy the skin, and bind the place
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It will heal quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On Windings, and the quality of the bandage.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Wounds are caused by horns, and by air, and by pus.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And the dressing is done in two ways
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	One is with scarification and extraction of blood: and the other is dressing without scarification
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this dressing which is without scarification is done in two ways
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the dressings which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen in number for the body
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of these, one is the dressing of Aloe, and it is the most recent for the head: and Alkhel, and it is middle of the neck: and the dressings of Aloes of the Gardens, and they are two layers of the neck from two parts together: and the dressing of Mint, and it is under the mandible in the lower part of the mouth: and the dressing of the Two Spines, and they are two layers of the cheek: and the dressing of Alachosos over the end of the tail: and the dressing of the Two Grooves, and they are middle of the two arms: and the dressing of the Two Ribs, and they are under the two elbows: and the dressing of the Two Heels
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	Neither does external application of powder exert blood from small wounds scattered through the flesh; for that reason it does not cause the loss of vital force from the body, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Neither does it suffice to apply powder with fire, or without fire, to any ailment that arises from excessive filling of the body until the whole body is evacuated
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	When need compels us to apply powder in an ailment, whether due to custom or for the benefit of the patient, we shall administer it at the beginning, at the end, and in the middle of the month, and at any other time as required
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	For indeed, when men are multiplied in their blood, until they crave its extraction through powder, they find in their head a burden.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from the body comes the filling and redness of the face, head, and neck
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from the body comes the itching of the face, the forehead, the temples, and the dimming of the eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	The body itself is the seat of powder application.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	The body's laughter is multiplied
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from the body comes the taste of blood in the mouth: either the tongue swells up and expels blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	The body's sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from the body comes sweating in sleep, blood, redness, boils, and similar things
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see any of these things, or at least in the middle of the month: we order powder to be applied immediately, after two or three hours have passed
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The application of the Ventosation of the Neck is as follows: since it itself contributes to the gravity in the head, and what flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	It should be administered after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this is indeed the Ventosation of the Cephalic Vein.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	It is not permitted to use it on those who are of a cold complexion, or in whom there is a discharge from the eyes
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings about a great heat.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	It is not suitable to use it in the elderly, or in those whose heads suffer from cold ailments
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever uses it excessively will cause great pain in the head
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	Therefore it is necessary to support the hand with the open palm downwards, away from the face, fearing the generation of a headache
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The Ventosation or Alkehel is the place of the phlebotomy of the Vein of the Fuscus, and of the vein of the Basilica, and because of this it contributes to asthenia, and constriction of the chest, and pain in the instruments of the chest, and cough, and swelling.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	It is necessary to apply the Ventosation of the Alkehel downwards, because if it is placed downwards, it will cause stiffness of the heart and the stomach
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The application of the Ventosation is useful for headaches, dizziness, migraine, perforation and toothache: it is the place of the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary to hold the hand firmly without grasping it during the procedure: so as not to damage the artery and cause the flow of blood to be obstructed
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The windward side of the face, when it is wet, brings moisture to the mouth, corrupts the gums, and brings about similar ailments which are in the mouth: and it stands in the place of a bloodletting which is in two veins.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The windward side of the face, when it is wet, brings moisture to the lips, which is caused by reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The windward side of the face, when it is wet, brings moisture to the three angles of the mouth, Basilica, Fez, and Cephalic: because it attracts blood from all these small veins which are in the flesh: and it attracts these small veins from other greater veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary, in order to prevent the effects of the wind, not to make too great an incision: because the place is naked of flesh, and under it are nerves and blood vessels.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The wind which comes upon the cheeks brings about haemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary, in order to prevent the effects of the wind, that it should be great and dry: because the place requires strong suction, and the fine veins may be broken by strong suction: and a great incision is made.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The winds of the cheeks cause the diminution of the disease: because they draw blood from the whole body, and bring about ancient pains in the buttocks, and the uterus, and the testicles: they cause menstruation, and bring about swelling, and inflammation: and they stand in the place of two saphenous veins, and the marrow bones
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	But they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The marrow bones are a proximate cause of the two winds of the cheeks.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the veins is such that you should place the inflated [catheter] in the first cavity, and perform suction with a moderate degree: and do not prolong the position of the veins, but place them quickly, and move them quickly, so that the humors may come to their proper place at the same time: and do not cease doing this until the place is already red and swollen, and the red blood appears. Then indeed you should scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who is of slender body, little-haired, he should indeed scarify himself once, not more: so that he does not ulcerate the place
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And command the Surgeon to amplify the scarification, and deepen slightly: and temper the suction with ease, and speed, and movement of his hand
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that he scarify himself twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance open a small opening under the thinness of the blood, and its moisture: and in the second instance the meticulous extraction of thick blood
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is dark and feculent, then make a third scarification: so that the last thing remains.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract the blood gradually, or little by little, sufficeth for us one scarification.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	When we wish to extract much blood, we make several scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that he scarify deeply: and the equal endpoint of the scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which must be managed from the oils at the position of the veins, and what is the cause of the swelling?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	When the skin is large, hard, tough, and its pores are strict, it is necessary to anoint the area with open, soothing, resolving oils: if it is in summer, like almond oil or oil of violets, or sweet marigold oil, or oil of cucumber seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or balsam: these are similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If there is excessive moisture, great and cold: then apply amaranth oil, or balsam oil or white oil, or ivy oil: these are similar things.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the wound is full of wind, soft and fleshy: then it is necessary to prevent moisture from adhering, and to wash the area with rose water, or cold water, or warm water, or cucumber water, or seawater: and like these things.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He who has much blood in his wound, wash the wound with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and alum: and like these things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	He who has large moisture, wash the wound with old wine, or with fennel water, or decoction of ivy, or chamomile: and like these things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	It is necessary to keep the wound moist in a bath, or in a basin, and it is necessary to administer after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And do not let anyone sleep after the wound has been washed.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that is necessary to regulate the wound, or phlebotomy before washing?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, it is necessary to consider in the first place: if the wound is choleric, or phlebotomy, and if the blood is acute and inflamed: then it is necessary to take chills, such as pomegranate seed: and also garlic with vinegar and lettuce, and rue, and ivy: and like these things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	Put the powder of the ointment on the wound, and the flesh of the body will be soft, and the food with the barley: thus shall it be like them.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	If the consistency of the ointment is cold, it is necessary that you add to it a syrup of honey, or of aloes, or of poppy seeds: and add a moderate perfume, which is between a strong and a new one: and it is prescribed to use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	Put the powder of the ointment on the wound, and the flesh of the body: and the sparrows, that is, small birds: and the pigeons, which is soot of doves: it must be like this
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	It is necessary that the drink of the days of rest and blood-letting be more than food: and it is necessary that it be given in a drink in some men at the hour of the hare and fox, or a medicine of musk, that is, myrrh, or alum before rest, or before blood-letting, or afterwards: in order to comfort the principal parts and temper the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	It is not necessary to add vinegar to the drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Of vomiting without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But those vomtings which are without scarification are those which occur above the spleen, and the loin, and the heel, and above the belly, the navel, and the kidney: because these members do not suffer scarification over themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not asked for in vain, except for an attack from a member of the blood to a member: as we put vomiting above the breasts in the flux of blood of the nose
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	We must be cautious lest we cause a cold sensation in the wound by putting the vomit on it: as we put the vomit on the belly and the navel.</start_of_turn>
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	The limb itself does thereby become rareified, and is heated, and the pain is removed thereby, because it resolves the swelling.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also applied over the kidneys, when it happens in the belly fat, or the spleen
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	The bile may force out the fat perhaps open the swelling, or eradicate the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	It does the same thing when it is applied over the liver, and the spleen helps to soothe the swelling in both of them
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	These winds are administered with a section only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with warm water in pleurae: and thus the wind is produced, and it becomes great, only with warm water alone, or with water in which herbs that are appropriate are boiled
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the wind administered with fire is as follows
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Its breadth is two open fingers; its depth is half of a palm; its side is in the middle, at a small opening; the quantity of air in it is according to the quantity of the needle: let there be air like this, or citrine, with rough edges, soft, equal, fine: so that it does not harm the limb in its position over it: and there is in the middle of it a transverse vein of air or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And thus this swelling is made great, greater than we have said, and a little less than that, according to the ailments and the age of the one who uses it
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	The winds of children, and extenuators are other things than the winds of the young, and of the fat people.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this [ointment] with fire over the limb is that you raise the license with fire from the navel downwards, or produce a flame from the palm of your hand from the heel: and place it over the middle of the veins which are in the middle of the ointment. So that the fire is raised around the lower part of the ointment, so that the body of the patient is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed over the limb: and the finger rests on the hole which I mentioned, until the ointment is firm: when we have finished, we remove the finger, and the vapor rises from that hole, and the ointment is immediately dissolved
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then kindle the license according to its manner, and do it again, if you have not digested it well.</start_of_turn>
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In Venus [ointment] which is administered in pleurisy with water, there is no vein or hole: and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and is placed only on the limb.</start_of_turn>
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn>
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger the Venus is, the more it can absorb water, the better.</start_of_turn>
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the suspension of blood-sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter XCIX.</start_of_turn>
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-sugars are not administered in multiple places, except in those parts where it is not possible to place the ointments, because of their smallness, such as the lip and the tongue, and things like that.</start_of_turn
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a limb denuded of flesh, such as the finger and the nose, and things like that.</start_of_turn
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using these [ointments] is: to take them from blood-sugars which are in sweet waters, far from putrefactions.</start_of_turn
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are sent forth by day and night into sweet water, until the patients are satiated, and nothing remains within them.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated first with phlebotomy, and with enema.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then strip off the limb of the patient, until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then put on above it
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are full, they must be let go of, and there is a possibility of sucking up the place with enema, then that is the last thing: and if not, then draw out the place with vinegar
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and it is beaten and squeezed out
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	And if the course of the blood should be prolonged after the evacuation of the blood-sugars, and that is that it remains running: then pour oil over a thread in cold water, and put it on top, until the discharge is stopped
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	And if the blood should be multiplied, then sprinkle over it the powder of alum or gall, and similar things from the styptics: until the blood is stopped
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or put on the place middle cloths of barks stripped off: and send away, until the cloths adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if necessary to repeat the evacuation of the blood-sugars, when it is possible, to change them easily.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If however the evacuation of the blood-sugars is prohibited from suspension, then evacuate the place with blood recently.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or keep the sponge in the place, until something comes out of the blood
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then put on, for they themselves when they feel something from the blood, adhere immediately
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When any one wishes that they may fall, let them sprinkle something from aloe, or salt, or ashes upon their face: and they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	When anyone wishes to fall, let them sprinkle something from aloe, or salt, or ashes upon their face: and they will fall immediately.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	When anyone wishes to fall, let them sprinkle something from aloe, or salt, or ashes upon their face: and they will fall immediately.

Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	When anyone wishes to fall, let them sprinkle something from aloe, or salt, or ashes upon their face: and they will fall immediately. This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	When anyone wishes to fall, let them sprinkle something from aloe, or salt, or ashes upon their face: and they will fall immediately. Note that the sons of physicians and those who have not studied ancient books, and who have not learned anything from them, will reject this chapter as foolish
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this reason, it is because this method is private among the sciences of our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have not learned of anything good from this in any way, and I am not sufficient in this from that, except for the length of my study of ancient books, and the study of their intellect, until I have extracted the science from them
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhere to experience and the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have described to you in this chapter all that contains the science which is in my possession: and beyond that which has passed my experience, after I have abbreviated it for you, and I have published it for the purpose of abbreviation, and I have finished with the purpose of declension: and I have devised many forms of instruments which are administered in this case, as well as for the addition of declension, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections concerning the state of bone fractures, from which the preceding remarks are necessary, before we proceed to the recall of fractured members and their various forms.
Caput II.	Summary and collection concerning the condition of bone fractures, from which the preceding remarks are necessary, before we proceed to the recall of fractured members and their various forms.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	As it is stated in the prologue of this chapter, we must now speak of summaries and chapters which are necessary for one who wishes to arrive at a true understanding of this art: for some have deemed it necessary to add this noble science, while others have omitted it from their work.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	When any fracture, dislocation, twisting or turning of a limb, or any violent impact occurs: then it is necessary at the outset to draw blood from him and to treat the wound itself, or both at the same time: for if nothing hinders it, such as weakness of spirit: or if there is any child or old man present who is unable to give an account of himself: or if the time is unfavourable, either because of excessive heat or excessive cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food, with cold drinks, and with birds' flesh and herbs: and refrain from wine, and from coarse food, and let him nourish himself from food and every other nourishment that fills the veins
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until then, when he is secure from the after-heat of the wound, and no longer experiences the discharge of pus from the limb: then let the sick man return to his ordinary diet as soon as he is able to do so, with the food which he is accustomed to eating
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the fractured bone begins to restore itself, then it is necessary to feed the sick man nourishing and wholesome food in great quantity, such as barley bread baked with water, barley porridge, heads of cabbage, feet and legs of pork, and fish: and strong drink, and things like these
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	When used in this way, the regimen promotes the coagulation of fractures more quickly and effectively.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	You know that broken bones, when they are in a state of decay due to their old age, and are decrepit, are not able to continue to harden and consolidate according to their natural course because of the drying out of their parts: and they harden and continue only in the degree of softness.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Truly, nature adds something like glue to every part surrounding the broken bone, which has the property of thickness, which adheres to it and tightens it until it is consolidated together, and binds together until it reaches the degree of firmness and strength which it had at first, without hindering any of its operations: and for this reason it is necessary to provide the sick person with food that has abundance, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said before
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	You know that there are different kinds of fractures, depending on the different parts of the body: for example, a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull: and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the backbone: and so on with all the other parts of the body. I have mentioned in my chapter the different kinds of fractures which are exposed.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	Fractures of bones also differ in their kind.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because sometimes the bone breaks in an arched form, along with the splinters that occur in them.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes the fracture is longitudinal of the bone: and there are fractures that are compound, that is, which have splinters, like in a quill, when a knife is applied to write with it
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	Neither is it complete: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head: and that is a small fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	Every species has an innate faculty, or its own instrument, in restoring itself, according to the recollection that arises concerning it, distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	From this it is known that the fracture of a bone is its twisting, and its elevation: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore it is not apparent that there is twisting in the place, neither is there any sound at the touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor is there great pain: then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there is twisting or a small fracture: it is not necessary therefore to move or compress the limb altogether, but rather to place above it a remedy which brings to mind the recollection which has arisen in that place at that moment. Then the stricture will be bound together with a subtlety.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	You also know that when an arch is bent and broken into two, except when this happens by chance, all the parts are moved away from their companions: then it is necessary for you to begin at the beginning to restore it, equalizing it before the swelling has subsided
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if there is a cold swelling, then leave it for a few days, until the swelling has subsided
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then restore it according to whatever method you can from gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	You know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than the bone itself in which the swelling happens
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it up, according to the recollection which has arisen to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are bulges in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this limb from two parts, if the hand is involved, or the foot: or with your hand, if the limb is small: or with two bands, or with a bandage and a hand
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb above a level place, following its natural figure, until the parts of the fractured limb extend: then strive, with all your skill, to restore those additions to their proper place; and do so in whatever way seems best to you. And take heed of your strength, lest you cause pain or damage to the patient by your operation. And strive with your strength to apply one bone to its partner, following the better form.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it should be in this hour that you grasp and touch the limb yourself.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If there is anything else which hinders you there, correct it and make it equal in quantity to your power
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	Take heed of excessive extension and compression, as many stones do
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many do violence to their operation by excessive swelling or contraction in the limb: as we have seen this to happen from the operations of many
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind on after the equalization and lower the operation, and tighten that limb, and quiet it, and tranquility: and praise the patient above all.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him quiet, lest he move in the hours of night, and his sleep during his convalescence, and his waking in the morning, and his eating, and all his movements at the last behest of his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And take heed that the position of the limb is not such as to cause him pain
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is to say, when he feels pain or discomfort in the position of the limb: then it is necessary to change it to another position in which he does not feel pain
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And take heed of that, also, that his position be equal and straight: that no twisting occur in the limb when restoring it
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	The quality of the fracture of a broken limb is as I have described.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that broken limbs vary in size and shape, as well as in number.</start_of_turn>
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Small bones, such as the arm, finger, ankle and their like, must be bound with soft padding, due to their tenderness.</start_of_turn
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Large bones, such as the thigh and shin, must be bound with a wide, hard dressing.</start_of_turn>
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament connects the large limb and tightens it from all sides with equal force, it does not allow it to be displaced.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after you have evacuated the bowels, commence to apply a bandage appropriate to the limb, on the support of soft cushions over the site of the fracture.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then, bind the ligament over the site of the fracture three or four times, as needed for the limb: and tighten your hand along with the ligament.</start_of_turn
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then, support the upper part beyond the fracture site, and tighten less than the tension you used to apply to the fracture.</start_of_turn
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then, keep the limb extended with the bandage beyond the fracture site, and gradually soften the tension until you reach a healthy state.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then, do the same again, and bind the limb once more over the fracture with bandages.</start_of_turn>
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then, support the limb with the bandage below the fracture.</start_of_turn
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the bandage and the softening of it, as we said in the first bandage above.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the sutures a soft lump of wax or cloth, so that the fracture's curvature is evened out if there is any curvature: but if there is none, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then place another dressing over the former.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards make the sutures even over the placed dressings immediately, if there is no swelling or hardness in the place
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If, however, there is swelling or hardness in that place: then place above that which sits the said swelling, and it will expel the swelling: and remove the swelling a little every few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then string over that immediately the sutures once more
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the sutures be of the middle size of broad barley, round, well-shaped: or they may be of wood which has become brittle from age, which is the pith of elder or wormwood, or palm branches, or nails: and let the width of every suture be according to this form, and this very figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	It is true that the suture which is placed above the tract should be thicker and wider than the rest of the sutures: and the length of the suture should be according to the size and nature of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then string over the sutures with another dressing, according to the first measure.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie over it with wire in the middle, immediately, according to what we have said concerning the measure: and it is that the measure should be greater over the place of the fracture: and the greater the distance from the fracture, the smaller the measure
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the wire should be of medium thickness and fineness, and that it should be of soft wood
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the wire is thick, like oil from the operation of placing stones, it is a great mistake: for the measure will fall from the quality of the thread.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	The fine thread does not meet again: for you do not follow through with strictness as regards that which you desire.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	It should not be like that between the star and the star less than a finger's breadth
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the sick person is injured between the stars by the strictness in the healthy places: then put under the wound something soft, such as wool or carmine wool, until nothing is injured from that
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is a fracture with a wound, and there has happened a disruption in the skin: I will come with a reminder of it in the second chapter concerning the singularity
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you know that not every fractured limb needs to be bound with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	For a large limb, it is not necessary to bind it with stars immediately. But after five or seven or more days, according to your security concerning the event of the after-heat.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the manner of plasters which the ancient people used to restore, which they put over the fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	A common abbreviated method of plastering which restores the fracture, suitable for various temperaments, especially women and children: because it does not cause heat nor cold to adhere to it.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you take from the flour mill, and it is the middle of the wheat which hangs in the mill-pails at the movement of the millstone: and you fashion it as such, except that you add to it some plaster of Paris and white lead. And you put on the confection of it not thick, neither thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it as needed.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plastering, which restores the fracture, dislocation and torsion
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe of meal, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath: with ten myrrhas of succ, and five aloes of both, and twenty of alethil. They are all boiled together, and then cribellated, and mixed with lukewarm water, or with vinegar if the patient's complexio is high.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For indeed it is a good composition, restores fractured bones quickly, and strengthens many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plastering, which also strengthens fractures and torsions
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe of mugath, and meal, and white alum, with ten myrrhas of succ, and five aloes of both, and six acacia with twenty parts of boiled armenium. They are all boiled together, cribellated, and formed with water, or vinegar: and administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Method of plastering for joint injuries, and bones separated from their places: and it soothes the pain of an accident, and splits the bone, and fractures it
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take a strip of lint soaked in vinegar, and dip it in decocted oil: and apply it over the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good in the suppression of a hot after-effect: and it drives away the pain itself.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Method of plastering which restores the fractured bone
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fennel seed and leaves of wild rue: and grind them both together to make plaster
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Method of abbreviated plastering, administered for the restoration of a fractured bone: and when you wish for the resolution of the remaining after-effect.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe for the root of the elderberry, chamomile, violets, and barley herbs, all of which are taken in one part. They are boiled together with wine, unless a heated member is present.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If, however, a heated member is present, then confect it with warm vinegar, or with water, and use it thus.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another strong method for healing, in the case of a hard after-effect following restoration of the limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe for the root of the elderberry, flaxseed, poppy seeds, melilot, chamomile, violets, and sambucus, all of which are taken in one part. They are boiled together with salty water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	The whole of this should be done according to the degree of heat of the limb, and should be calmed by the heat of the limb itself.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates himself did not say in his book that anything should be placed upon a fractured limb during its restoration, except for butter or oil: nothing else. He says that there should be an intermediate degree between the thickness and thinness
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, considers it useful to place upon a fractured limb during its restoration various things which contain an exication of heat, such as myrrh, aloes and balsam, and similar things to these
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A method for applying a dressing which brings relief to the wound and the pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe for mugwort, ciceris, human hair clippings, or bird feathers, elderberry, and salt, taken in equal parts. They are boiled, crushed, and mixed together to form a dressing
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, however, should be according to what is needed, so that the ligament remains, and then it should be dissolved, that is to say, that you should consider whether there is still pain, itching, or swelling of the fractured bone in its place: do not dissolve it for many days
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happen to him in a place of itching, or pain disturbing, or swelling: then let him rise up promptly, and resolve in an hour itself, and take away the plaster from him: and take hold of a soft cushion, or a sponge of maritime linen, moistened: and submerge him in warm water, and bathe with it until the itching subsides, and the pain settles.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	And let him leave the limb quiet for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	And let him put upon him a dry wool blanket, immersed in vinegar and oil, or oil of roses: and bind up upon him at night one, until he is secure from the heat, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and the pain ceases.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	And do it again to the limb softly, and remove the plaster little by little: and do not bind it tightly at first, but bind it softly with him, until it is healed
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you have seen that the swelling has subsided, and the redness, and the pain, and the itching, and all the other accidents have passed away, and digestion of the plaster and the binding: then do it again in this way as you did at first equally
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing happens to the limb from these things which we have mentioned, then do not dissolve it, except after three days, or four, or five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it has been a whole twenty days since the beginning, according as you see the limb recovering from the solution, as we have mentioned, until when the fracture has rejoined, and the clotting of the flesh has approached on it: add also to the binding more than the first binding you made: and also to the nourishment of the sick food, according as the remembrance of it returns.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If, however, you see the place of the fracture has been evacuated more than is necessary: then you know that the nourishment is hindered from proceeding to it
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Embroca it therefore with warm water throughout every cavity which contains it, and let it remain there for three days, and then gently tighten the surrounding area.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	This treatment therefore runs to the nourishing limb, and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which makes the restorers of fractures stumble from the fracture of the limb by the other side, when it is not restored at first, according as it should be, and is restored according to its curve, is an error in their operation, and great fear: for if it had been the rectum, the old men would have said of it in their books, and they operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	I have never seen any trace of that in this at all, and it is better that it should not be done thus.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	About the fracture in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are various kinds of fractures, and their figures are many: and their causes are diverse.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For a fracture is what is done by a blow with a weapon: and the blow raises the whole bone until it reaches the marrow, which is under the bone, like an axe in wood: and for this reason this kind of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the weapon strikes something of the bone, and breaks its face, and does not penetrate to the end of it: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, complete fracture
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there are two kinds of fractures, or a great one, or a small one
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And the fracture is also that which is a tear, or a break: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall from a height, or something similar
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	This fracture is also either penetrating or non-penetrating, which approaches the nerve which is under the bone: or that is on the face of the bone. It is a wound of two kinds of fracture, or small or great.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	The fracture which is hidden in the bone in the thickness of a hair: it is a small fissure, and for this reason it is called the capillary fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	The fracture which is caused by a blow, or by a stone, or by things of a similar kind, which make the lamina of the bone break inwards, and makes a hollow space: as happens with blows of the air, when there is a blow and something goes inwards
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	It mostly happens in the heads of wet bones, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fractures are separated by a swelling which comes from the fracture itself. And I will speak of all of them in their place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	We recognize all these kinds of fracture by their appearance on the surface, by their tension, and by the removal of the corrupted flesh which is above them
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillary fracture is recognized by this, that it appears on the bone, is stripped off and is bound over with lead: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of fractures, consider first the signs of the patient: then if you see signs which signify a serious matter above fear, such as vomiting of cholera, and swelling, and loss of consciousness, and loss of speech, and fainting, and high fever, and discharge from the eyes, and redness of the skin, and similar things which are caused by various conditions, even if you do not suspect them, do not delay treatment: and if you do not see serious signs, and you hope for recovery, then begin to treat it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If it happens that a wound comes to you in the cold season, then on the fourteenth day after it occurs, it is necessary to study the removal of bone.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	If in the summer days it occurs, then it is necessary to prepare for the removal of bone before the seventh day, before the soft parts beneath the bone become corrupted, and before these things happen which we have mentioned.</start_of_turn>
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of a bone has reached the brain, and it is with small pieces and traction, then it is necessary to cut away the displaced part and the attached fragment, according to what has been told you.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	It is necessary to support the head of the wounded person: and to support over the bone in any way possible: and according to the form of the wound, and what is soft over the infirm.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens that during the detection of a flowing blood vessel, or a soft swelling: then oppose it with what is necessary.</start_of_turn
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is necessary to place a pad with wine-soaked cloths over the wound, and sprinkle with salt: and make the wound quiet, until the swelling subsides, and be secure from the flow of blood.</start_of_turn
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone, and its removal.</start_of_turn>
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to two methods.</start_of_turn>
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The first method is to cut the bone with a straight chisel.</start_of_turn
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then give another chisel wider than the first one: and this is the form of this.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	And then give another chisel even wider than the previous one.</start_of_turn
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that there be beside thee a number of diverse Incisors: some of which are broader than others, and some of which are narrower than others: and that they be at the utmost acute of their edges, and that they be of iron or steel, and that you use ease in their percussion over the Incisor, so that it does not crush the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If, however, the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to perforate its circumference before you administer the Incisors, with needles which are called non-deep: and they are not called thus except when they do not pass through the end of the bony cortex to that which is beyond it: because the needle is a rounded extremity above that, which is under the acute angle of the head, similar to the margin, and a small circle hinders its immersion, and its passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting that you take from these needles a great number, of which each one shall be equal to the quantity of thickness of the bone, until present be in thee all around the Needle: the quantity of the acute extremity of which in length and breadth is equal to the quantity of thickness of that circumference
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three kinds of needles, or Trepanae.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the perforation in the circumference of a fractured bone is: to place the Needle on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the Needle to another place, and place that which is between every hole the quantity of the radius, or around that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the Incisors between every hole from the bone: and do this more subtly than the might from the end of the lesion, as we have said, until you have fractured the bone, or your hand, or with some other instrument which you have prepared for this: such as tweezers and fine forceps
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	It is necessary to take every precaution, lest you touch the Brain or any instrument from the abdomen.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have completed the perforation of the bone and it is separated from the abdomen, if it is continuous with the latter, you must extract it, taking care not to damage the surrounding structures with another instrument like an Incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	It is necessary to make the hole small and fine, like other Incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If anything small remains from the small bones and the fat: grasp them easily with the instrument that is beside you
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound afterwards as with the dressings that we mentioned before
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	Another method of operation is simple, far from fear: which Galenus praised highly: this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is not necessary at first to remove the fragment of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and obvious: until you have removed that fragment, and placed under it the tip of this lenticular Incisor.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	The blunt part of the lenticular Incisor does not damage anything: and the acute part of it is wide on both sides, like water: so that the blunt part is close to the abdomen, with the acute part of the instrument facing the bone
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then pierce through the Incisor from one side with a small hammer, until you have pierced the whole bone easily: as if you were rotating it: and you will be secure from the nerve, which you fear will be injured in this process.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	Even if the physician is not stupid among men, and is ignorant of this, or is asleep: if anything remains attached to the bone from the nerve in some place, he should remove it with the tip of the lenticular Incisor itself, and deliver it easily from that
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	He is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	If a bone fracture does not penetrate to the marrow cavity, and that which is broken off from the bone is its surface, and remains in the same position and slight roughness: then it is necessary to smooth out that roughness, and remove those slight roughnesses with fine files of various sizes, so that it is possible to manipulate them easily in any convenient place, and to correct their position, according to the thing which the operation requires, and the fractured bone itself, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary to work with reason, that is, to begin with the coarser files, and then gradually proceed to the finer ones
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the finer ones afterwards.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease working until you have reached the finest degree, and until you can manage them more tenaciously and delicately in everything
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	With regard to all small cracks and slight fractures, it is necessary to take care of them, according to what leads to their correction
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	It is a thing which does not escape anyone skilled in this art, and which has stood over what we have written and what we have said concerning great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, the marrow cavity is detected to remain when you fracture the bone: then it is necessary to take a piece of gauze, according to the size of the wound, and to soak it in rose-water, and to place it over the wound opening
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	And take another piece of gauze, doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and rose-water, and place it on the first gauze: and make it as easy as possible for the patient to breathe over it, so that it does not suffocate him.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer above the wide ligament: and do not tighten it, except for as much as is necessary to support the bone alone: and remove it with care on the first or second day, until you are certain that the wound is healed.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then cure it, and afterwards apply these medicines which are useful for excessive moisture: such as lily roots, barley flour, chaff, chamomile, and the like: and it is necessary that you make from these medicines a powder which will be scattered over the wound like dry things.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And in general administer all medicines which have the property of drawing out, and do not bite
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And be careful according to your skill, so that the wound in your care be soft: neither greasy, neither biting
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Neither let pus collect in it in any way: for when pus collects on the brain, it corrupts it, and putsrefies it, and brings about great harm afterwards: and this often happens in the head, when its care is neglected, blackening its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore at that time, if there occur in the patient accidents which we have mentioned, you know that it is dangerous to delay treatment
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackening does not happen, except for the medicine which is put on it, and it is in the skill of that medicine, to make it black: then it is necessary to take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and lines with it like wool.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put it on the wound: afterwards care for it with the methods which are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	And concerning the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.
Caput IIII.	Chapter III.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken except for its two upper parts simultaneously, or one of them alone: because they are two bones. For the lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not break, and does not happen to it except for attrition, twisting, and similar things.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary to insert the little finger into the nose-hole and break it with the index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and this must be done skillfully and with ease.</start_of_turn>
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware not to cause additional pain during your operation.</start_of_turn>
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and does not reach the little finger: then it is necessary to equalize the smaller extremity, in which there is a small bulge.</start_of_turn
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in both parts, then do the same thing: and keep the restoration of the first day of the fracture as much as possible.</start_of_turn>
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days of rest after the heat has subsided.</start_of_turn>
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the extremity of the nose a strip of linen from the cloth of linen, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two strips if the fracture is in both parts: and let there be in the strip a thickness equal to the size of the hole of the nose.</start_of_turn
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers say that they should be moistened with butter, and changed every day.</start_of_turn
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	This, however, does not seem to me to be useful, rather it is necessary to moisten the linen with white chalk or dust it with fine powder.</start_of_turn
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then release the license, until the bone has hardened, and induce the cartilage.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	When the pencil of the license has been introduced into the nose in the place of the license, after it has been covered over with soft tissue: then the fracture of the nose is held more firmly, and the patient will not be obstructed by inspiration.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do so; if you wish not, do nothing.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If the nose is fractured again while you are working after the swelling has subsided, plaster the nose with gypsum, or with blood clot infused in putty, or with some other dressing
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	However, if the swelling has subsided, then it is necessary to plaster the nose with pounded barley and powdered gypsum mixed with glue from an egg-white or with albumin of eggs
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place over it a soft cushion, and do not bind the nose to anything whatsoever
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If indeed the bones of the nose are fractured by a small fracture or a crack, then it is necessary to split these apart with instruments which are suitable for the purpose
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then cut them through, and care for the wound with that which is appropriate, and consolidate with dressings which are suitable for this, or with glue.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If between the nose and the upper lip there is a wound, then it is necessary to care for it with licenses: and administer lead ointment until it has healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured
Caput V.	(The text continues with further medical instructions.)
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then look to see if its fracture is only lateral and not broken into two pieces, and care for it inwards: then its knowledge is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	If there is a fracture on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's bone: likewise if the fracture is on the left mandible, then insert the index finger of the right hand. Impel with it the swelling of the fracture inwards with ease towards the exterior, with your other hand alter from the inside outwards, and with it equal the same.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the mandible has been separated into two parts, then it is necessary to manage the expansion from both parts, according to the direction of the fracture: until an equilibrium can be achieved
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, there is a displacement or fracture in the teeth, then string those from which you hope that the remainder will remain with a thread, or silver, or gut.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put over the fractured mandible a cushion
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over it a doubled sheet, and put over the sheet a large sponge made hollow: or a piece of skin equal in length to the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it up above, according to what is prepared for its ligation, and agrees with its application, until it is not destroyed: and command the patient, that he remain quiet and still: and give him food soft foods
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you think that something is changing with regard to the form or mode of something: then correct it, and solve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from it, and cover it with pounded powder, with alum or with sesame flour, after you have removed the cushion: and put over the covering a soft wool blanket.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While therefore the plaster remains fixed over that, and the position of the bone is not altered, remove it, do not break it, until it is healed: or bind the fracture
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	Many are the strings that bind this fracture in seven days.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If in the meantime the swelling becomes cold, then manage that which we have mentioned before concerning the strings of sedation until the swelling has subsided.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if the bone is fractured from the fragment, or from the suture: then make the suture of the bone with the instruments which are appropriate for the removal of that fragment
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the quantity of necessity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed the fragment and no more remains of it: close the wound if it is large: and if not, put over it patches which will cover it, and hold them in place until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the wrist when fractured
Caput VI.	(The provided text does not include the content of Chapter VI, so I am unable to translate it.)
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Very often the wrist is fractured from the front part towards the bone of the arm, and the fracture of it is done in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it is fractured and separated into two, besides which there are sutures: and that is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or that it is fractured in the bone of the suture: and that is more difficult for its restoration
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or that it is fractured with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in this case when the fracture is without a wound, is that you make two assistants present, one who holds the fractured wrist, and the other extends the forearm above the part
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture of your fingers until its shape is complete, according to what is necessary: and let it not be prominent, nor concave.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If excessive extension persists, then it is necessary to place under the thumb of the patient a sphere of wool or lint: let the size of the sphere be according to the quantity of necessity; extend and elevate the fracture, and cover the sphere with your hand, until the fracture is equal, according to what is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you are unable to draw the extremity of the fracture outwards: because it persists deeply: then it is necessary to recline the patient on his side: and place under the middle of the forearm a weight equal to the minister of the forearm: and press the minister of the forearm downwards until the bone of the fracture which is in depth is raised upwards: and then rectify the fracture and equalise the shape of your fingers
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel pain from the fracture, and swelling: then it is necessary to find over that and draw it outwards with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If, however, there is retention in the bone, then you must make an incision in it with one of your surgical instruments which you have prepared for this purpose: after you have placed under the fracture an instrument which will keep the soft parts open. And the instrument is of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is like a spiral which has no concavity
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	Let the width of it be according to that from which you must take out from the magnitude of the bone, and the extent of it.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length of it should also be as much as is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two extremities, like a U: and one extremity is wide, and the other is narrow
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the rupture of the wound that you saw when you extracted the splinter of bone is wide, and you secure it from the after-burn: then you add together the two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	If it is a small rupture, or sometimes there is a soft after-burn: then you close the wound with strips and small stitches according to the quantity of the wound.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If there is a soft after-burn, then pour oil of roses, vinegar, and wine over it and put on top of that.</start_of_turn>
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The fracture of a bone that is without wound and without section, is, as you put on a plaster made from flour of wheat with barley or alum.</start_of_turn>
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put a soft cushion over it.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a ball under its head if necessary.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bandage, which is, the one which the Saracens hold, which is long and wide: and be its width the palm of one hand, or somewhat less.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a doubled cushion over the cushion and the plaster.</start_of_turn>
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a bandage from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and in length similarly.</start_of_turn
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap the bandage in cloth.</start_of_turn
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the oilcloth with the bandage in the place where it rests on the fracture and the place.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then put the limb on the fracture so as to restore its position, and wrap the bandage over the neck of the limb and under the healthy and unhealthy parts: and reduce the bandage over all parts, so that the bandage does not cover the fracture, and that the bandage is stable.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, it is necessary to inspect the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	How often, then, is the ligament to be softened, and how is the stone to be removed: then restore it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient’s sleep on his back, and put under his armpit in the sleep of him the little pillows in the night, so that when he wakes up the attendants will find him with them on the side of his body
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fractured bone of the collarbone is elevated by raising the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the arm to the chest: do not loosen the ligament unless it is necessary for the purpose of treatment, or from a swelling, for up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see that the swelling of the face has ceased at that place
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And keep it firm, and let go of it, until it is restored and coagulates
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fractured bone of the collarbone is stretched and comforted according to many people in eighty days: and when it is in any man in less time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of the fracture of the scapula.
Caput VII.	(The text following this section is not included in the request and is therefore not translated.)
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	It is rare for the scapula to fracture, and on its wide side: and they do not fracture from these except for the margins of it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When it fractures in that place, and fractures in the middle of it, and it is not known except by touch: then try to prepare it according to the figure of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it above the natural figure in every way of ingenuity, that is as much as possible
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place over the place the powdered rosin with the alum, and the soft wool pad, and place upon that a small piece of cloth doubled.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place over it a thick layer of sponge from the board as much as the whole spatula, or a little less.</start_of_turn>
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed under the sponge there is a cavity in some place of the spatula, then equalize that cavity with the soft wool pad until the sponge descends even.</start_of_turn>
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind above with long aloes, gentle constriction, and firmness of the sponge, until it does not move from its place.</start_of_turn>
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	Consider the ligament in every day.</start_of_turn
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever it is softened the ligament, bind it and equalize the sponge if it moves from its place: and let the patient rest on his sound side.</start_of_turn
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the sponge is restored in ninety days, or in ninety-five days.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When that time has elapsed, then loosen the ligament: and you will be secure.</start_of_turn
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For the bones from whose connection there is no haste, neither their solution.</start_of_turn
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If indeed it proceeds from a fractured bone, and projects under the skin: then cut over that, and remove it.</start_of_turn
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we said in the fracture of the collarbone from the softening of the after-swell, if anything occurs from that.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	¶ On the restoration of a fractured breastbone.</start_of_turn>
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.</start_of_turn>
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	When the chest is fractured in the middle, it is rarely the case.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The limbs are usually fractured in such a case, and diminish from the violence of the accident.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle of it is fractured, which inclines downwards, and there is pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps blood is omitted, and displacement is recognized in the fractured bone, and it is not hidden from the sense. The restoration of it is that the patient should rest on his back: and put between his thumbs and index fingers
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then bind his arms, and join the ribs from two parts or from the sides with the hands: and twist it gently to and fro, as much as is possible, until the shape of the bone is restored, as it should be
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put upon it a compress and a dressing, and put upon it a bandage of a thin board of lead, or gypsum, or something similar in lightness, after having bound the hand in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then tighten the binding around the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and be careful with the binding according to the extent of the wound, and bind it loosely.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding at every hour, and every time it is softened, bind the hand: and if its necessity indicates its solution at the wound, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or swelling: then remedy it, and solve the hand, and remove the compress, and correct what has happened in the method of treatment of it.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the compress, if you are able to do so: and bind it tightly, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	As for the restoration of the ribs, when they are fractured.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that a fracture of the Costae does not happen except in great places following the back, and from the extremities of them from the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen except by attrition, except because of that, for they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from sense at the inquiry with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done thus, that it is equal to the fracture with the fingers according to the possible mode, until the figure is equal, according to what is necessary
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then plaster, and bind the fractured bone with a staple, if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the Costae is sloping inwards: then it happens with weak pain that arises, and a puncture, as is the puncture for him who has pleurasy: because the bone pierces the lung, and also there happens difficulty with breathing, and coughing, and blood-stained saliva: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were learned in this with many learned men: and there are some who say that you should put on boards for the sick who generate inflammation and swelling, so that the belly inflates, and expands, and drives out the fracture outwards.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed abominate that it should be the cause of making a soft swelling, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it does happen, then it adds in this.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them say: put on a soft swelling over the place of swelling, then draw it with force, and this is similar to the ratiocination
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	But indeed they fear that it will pull out the swelling with excessive force at the place of the fracture
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: The place must cooperate with the wool which is already submerged in the warm fat: and they put in puluilli between the ribs, until it is completed: that there may be an equal ligation when you bind it according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	And then the patient is cared for by the dressing of the chest from food and medicine
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the patient is coarsened by the thing which he endures, which he cannot tolerate, and the bone is pierced with a wound that is painful, and we fear over the patient: then it is necessary that we split over the place and remove from the fractured rib
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	And then we place upon it an instrument which preserves the fat, whose memory has preceded it: and we break the bone with ease, and we break the thing itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	And then we join together two lips of the wound, if there is a great one with a suture: and we care for it with plasters, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	And if there should happen in the meantime a hard swelling, then be careful, and pour in wool into the fat and put on it: and care for the patient with that which agrees with the swelling
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	And also during this time the patient rests upon the side upon which he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	About the restoration of a fracture of the ribs and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	The bones of the neck when they have suffered a fracture, and rarely happens to them from attrition: and in like manner the ribs also
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When this happens to anyone, and you do not know whether he is healed or not: then be careful
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you touch his hand and it is softened, and puffed up, and dead: and you are not able to move it easily, neither to extend it nor to compress it: and when you compress it with your fingers and bind it with an awl, he does not feel it, neither does he feel any pain in it: then you know that he is not healed, and that it is deadly in many ways.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If the limb is relaxed and feels constriction with the fingers and point: then you know that the bone is healthy, and the patient will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If he groans like a patient with a sore back, and you wish to know whether he will recover or not: then look at his feet: if you see that they are softened and that this happens in both hands and in the foot: then when he lies over his back, vomiting and evacuation will go out without his will: and when he lies over his belly, evacuation will go out without his will: and when he lies over his back and wishes to eat, and is unable: then you know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	It is not in vain that you are treating him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If nothing else helps him, the matter is easier.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	His treatment is that you should apply a warm compress to the swelling: or smear it with oil of roses alone: or with some other unguents or ointment.</start_of_turn>
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Apply to the swelling several times a day until the swelling subsides: then place over the place one of the consoling cushions, evacuating and tightening over it with a bandage: and order the patient to rest quietly and peacefully.</start_of_turn
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Let him not sleep on the part which is painful until he has recovered.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens at the junction of the bones of the thigh or something which has been separated from it: then you must cut through the skin and sew it up.</start_of_turn
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.</start_of_turn
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself with any bodily ailment, from the unguents, until you are healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the heel bone is broken and the ankle is hanging: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the ankle, and to make equal the fractured bone, as much as possible, and to support the equal parts.</start_of_turn>
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place above it, and lift it up: and care for the wound with the care that preceded it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the restoration of the ankle.</start_of_turn
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.</start_of_turn>
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do the bones of the ankle break.</start_of_turn
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they do break, then the fracture of them is not, except for the loosening of the extremities: and they are split in length, and lean inward: and this causes pain in the place, and swelling: and stiffness of the leg that is broken.</start_of_turn
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it, until you are over the fracture in the same figure.</start_of_turn
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in the extremities of it, then equal it with the preparation that you make from the equation, until the figure is equal to its natural form.</start_of_turn
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If however the fracture is in length, or if it leans inward: then make the patient lie on his side over his foot, until the restoration of the fracture is prepared.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equaled it, place above it a dressing: then place above it a bandage of wood, or of leather: and bind a tight bandage over which you do not fear the displacement of the fracture, nor the removal of the bandage.</start_of_turn
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And the cavity shall be made even with that which is above, until it grasps the limb firmly according to its equality: and command the sick man to sleep over his back or over his side which is sound.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, a callous abscess should happen to arise: then cease from the extension of the limb and restore it, until the abscess becomes settled: and place over it that which is placed beneath it, according to what has gone before, and then return to the restoration of the limb: and bind it as seems best.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If indeed in the bone there should happen swelling or inflammation, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured bone.
Caput XII.	(The following text continues in the next reply due to length limitations.)
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The aid is that which is between the elbow and the head of the scapula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is fractured, then the restoration of it is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	The one is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape which follows
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligaments are bound at the two extremities
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	And it is suspended from a raised place: and the sick man shall sit upon it
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	And he shall project his fractured arm over the wood, until it reaches the midpoint of his elbow, where the curvature of the bone is located
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	And suspend from above something heavy, so that it extends the limb downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	And the physician shall equalize the fracture with his hands until the fracture is healed, according to what seems best
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And the other method is that the sick man should lie upon his chest: and suspend his limb from the neck with a ligament.</start_of_turn>
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants to hold one above the fracture with their hands: and the other to hold below it, and let each of them extend their hands to their own parts.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	Or if necessary, in order that the extension be stronger, then bind under the fracture with a ligament and above it with another ligament: and let each of the two assistants extend their hands to their two parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary to place one ligament under the olecranon and the other under the fracture beyond the elbow
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	Similarly if the fracture is close to the forearm: then it is necessary to place a ligament above the place and another above the forearm itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then keep the fracture still with ease without labor, until the fracture is equal according to what is necessary, and apply a good dressing: then bind it, if necessary after the swelling has subsided.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however swelling should arise, then remove the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put upon it a soaked bandage in vinegar and rose oil, until the swelling subsides: then bind it again. The manner of binding is that you place an plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new bandage over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then support the arm over the aid, and put their hand open over the arm.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put on a sleeve, and bind over the arm support so that the arm remains in the place of the bones that are fractured: if it does not prevent you from doing anything else, do not change anything about that which is above the fracture
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	Which if at any time anything changes above the fracture concerning the bones, then use a greater and stronger bandage than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And thou shalt place between every star a breadth equal to the breadth of a finger: and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture, with the addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	And string over the stars a strain as I said at the beginning of this chapter.</start_of_turn>
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that the strain over the place of the fracture be more strict.</start_of_turn>
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is prolonged, the less strict the strain shall be.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you have placed the stars and the strain, as we have said, at the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do this: and if the swelling is cold, then remove the strain and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in every three days, that it do not happen in the place of itching, or swelling, or that it be hindered from nourishing the limb by the disposition of the excessive strain.</start_of_turn>
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Thus do all things according as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are in great doubt, that nothing worse may happen: then do not loosen the ligament for more than three days, or more.</start_of_turn
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep on his back, with his hand on his stomach: and put under his thigh a cushion filled equally with wool.</start_of_turn
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day, that the fractured limb be not disfigured, or the ligament be not softened.</start_of_turn
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Thus do all things with your skill.</start_of_turn
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give food to the patient according to the order which we have prescribed, so that the food be soft at first, until the bone is begun to be strung: then it is necessary, that he should increase his food.</start_of_turn
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	The use of an assistant and a crutch is necessary in the treatment of such cases. It should be continued for forty days. Then it is necessary to dissolve the [condition] and apply a poultice, and to administer unguents which restore it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture be of the bone, bruised: then do not dissolve it from the ligament and the fragments until the lapse of fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a fracture of the arm
Caput XIII.	(The text for this section is not provided in the given context.)
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two radii
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is the forearm: and that which follows the thumb
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is the upper, and that which is placed under the forearm from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the greater bone is fractured alone, or the forearm: and perhaps both are fractured together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the greater bone of the forearm is fractured above, then the restoration of the same is easy, and its healing is more favorable
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower bone is fractured, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are fractured together
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone which is fractured is the greater bone above, then the doctor agrees to support the forearm with ease until it be equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the greater bone is fractured, then it is necessary to apply a stronger bandage above all
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	It is necessary also to apply the figure of the hand to the restoration of the limb and to extend the limb beyond the wrist
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb be above all the fingers, and the wrist below all the fingers, or the like: and the patient sitting square upon himself, and let the palm of the hand be towards him, or in direct line with it, in height, that the patient may not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then extend the arm from the lower part, or the hand itself, or with the ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And the other minister extends like this from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician must equal the bone, until it is reduced to the best possible figure
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	Which if there are fragments of bone, then try to reduce them in their place without displacement of your forces
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If however it appears that there is a separate fragment which has pierced the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above it, and remove it in the manner which has been mentioned previously
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If however the fracture is with a wound, I make of that head single, and take care of the cure from that point on
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If at the beginning of your treatment you find a callous swelling, then stretch the skin with a piece of rough cotton wool, and white wool, and let the middle be between the thickness and fineness: and bind up the hand tightly with the thread above, until the swelling subsides: then remove the cotton wool, and apply a prepared plaster made from pounded pounded barley with eggshell and alum
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place sponges, and let the sponge which is placed over the fracture itself be wider and stronger
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of sponges of the arm is six in various positions: whether the fracture is in one hole, or in two holes at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place a firm and tight dressing over the stronger and more extended part of the fracture, and somewhat more above or below it: or place a softer dressing than the previous one in proportion to the remembered indication at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that cover the fracture be soft, moist: and not hard, rough.</start_of_turn>
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread which is passed through the linen be of medium thickness between the fine and the coarse, as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligament after days.</start_of_turn>
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything happens which requires the rectification, such as itching which occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water until the itching subsides, and then remove the limb without constriction, until it is quiet, and then repeat the dressing.</start_of_turn>
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the dressing is now softened, and the bone is now removed, and things are similar to these: then rectify all this by your skill, and consider it again.</start_of_turn
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nourishment is hindered from reaching the limb because of the excess of the dressing, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat and remove it for a few days, until the nourishment reaches it, and then tighten it again.</start_of_turn
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if no other illness occurs with the patient which we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to dissolve the dressing except after twenty days or thereabouts.</start_of_turn
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then suspend the hand of the patient to his chest.</start_of_turn>
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his chest be even, and protect his skill from disturbing influences.</start_of_turn
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep upon his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture will be healed in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps in eighty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All this is according to the temperaments of the complexion, and the temperaments of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIIII.</start_of_turn>
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that the bones of the hand and the knuckles of the fingers rarely fracture.</start_of_turn>
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And they do not occur except from great attrition.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore it occurs, that the bones of the hand are fractured, or that there is attrition: then it is necessary that the patient sit with his buttocks square: and before him let there be a seat at an equal distance.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand above his extended arm.</start_of_turn
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then extend the bones of the fracture, and the physician must keep them even until they are united by good union.</start_of_turn
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, if there is no sign of a soft swelling.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then put on a collar according to the quantity of the place: and I will cover the arm with a linen cloth.</start_of_turn
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is below the middle of the forearm, then make a sphere like a ball from the cloth: and command the patient to rest with his forearm resting on his fractured hand: and bind it with a long cloth.</start_of_turn
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the collar be of leather, in which there is softness, that the skin may be applied with the body of the forearm: and bind the arm according to what is necessary.</start_of_turn
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is outside, then it is necessary: that you put on a bandage above, and a bandage below in the sole: and let the hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put on a support, as it is turned back: and extend between the fingers with the ligament
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	Which if it happens that a fracture occurs to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it is equal in measure as it is necessary
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it with the sole: and if it is loosened, put on for it a straight bandage, firm: so that the fracture is elevated, and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is of the remaining fingers, as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it is equal in measure, and is bound with the healthy finger which follows it: or they are all bound together: and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put on above it a firm bandage, as we said concerning the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in the restoration of it, and after the position of the dressing has been made: and oppose with it what is necessary, when anything happens from that, according as its narration is repeated.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	(The provided text does not include the translation of this section.)
Caput XV.	(The provided text does not include the translation of this section.)
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip joint fractures often, and is declared by sense: because it turns inward and outward towards the parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done thus, that it is bound above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the cripple is returned over its face
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then extend all the ligaments around it according to the equality: and this when the fracture is in the middle of the bone
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If the fracture is near the root of the coxae bone, then let a ligament be passed to the part above the pectinis, so that the extension may be cast upwards: and let another ligament be passed under the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus in like manner if the fracture is near the knee, then let a ligament be passed close to the knee, so that the extension may be cast downwards
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician must set the bone with his two hands until it is reduced to its natural position: and it must be joined with a good suture.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply a dressing and bind up, if the limb is not otherwise supported
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If this happens in the case of a limb that is still swollen: then leave it for a few days, until the swelling subsides, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The binding must be firm enough
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It must be bound over the fracture with strong material, that is, leather: and doubled twice, or three times: and let there remain from this excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then bind the thigh, until the heel reaches the root of the nail
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the coxae and the thigh near the knee, and bring the extremities of the thread from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up the thigh and the coxae what remains from the excess of the material.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place upon the coxae in the place of the fracture itself small cushions, and place upon the bone of the thigh one cushion.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill up the space between the thigh and the coxae with cloths and wool, so that the binding may be even
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong binding from the middle over the place of the fracture three or four loops
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	The more you lengthen the ligature at the site of the fracture, the more stricture will be lessened and the softer it will be.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Therefore stretch the two extremities of the ligature that you have placed between the hip and thigh bone
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind it with three nails as with both hands
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then stretch out both ends of the ligature towards the lower parts until you reach the heel of the foot
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when you have bound both ends, string also the extremities of the nails from the other side so that the ligament does not slip from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the tension over it, while it remains, so that no fracture of the limb, no swelling, no inflation or anything similar happens to it
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	Which if anything happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	So when you have solved the problem, and corrected what happened before, as we have said many times before
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed there is a fragment of bone that is protruding: then it is necessary to remove it, if this is possible.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find over that and remove it: and care for it as before, until the patient is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when the fracture of the hip has been sutured, besides adding nails as we mentioned before in the introduction and the body.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	Be careful in restoring it so that the patient does not become lame
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides applying the other thigh, it is necessary that the limb which was lame should become lame always
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	You know that the hip is sutured in fifty days, or a little more or a little less: all this is according to the variety of constitutions and the condition of the rest of the body.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of a fracture of the Rotula genu.
Caput XVI.	On the restoration of a fracture of the knee-cap
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You know that fractures of the knee-cap are rare, but they do happen frequently.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If it does happen, then it is not without fracture, or split, or a hole in its parts
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is like a wound, and without a wound
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And the limb hangs suspended with sensation
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that it is made equal to what was disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it is reunited and joined together as much as possible, and fabricated
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put on a plaster of wheat flour or barley meal with albumin, or oil: and put on a round bandage above it if you deem it necessary: and bind around it a strong dressing appropriate for this.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements which we narrate in the other fractures: like a cold pack, and similar things: thus, so that you oppose every cause of this with what is appropriate for it, until it heals
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a fracture of the leg
Caput XVII.	And so on for the restoration of a fracture of the leg
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You know that the leg has two bones, of which one is thick and is called the Cruris: and the other is thin and is called the Focile
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens with both of these kinds of fracture as it happens with the bones of the arm: and because of this its restoration is equal, and the operation is the same
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are fractured together, the Cruris is bent towards all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a bone is fractured more subtly, the knee turns towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a bone is fractured more coarsely, the knee is found below: and it is from that which does not cover your thigh
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then perform extension, and equalization, and ligation of the ligaments according to that which is equal
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it is necessary, if the fracture of the knee is a compound fracture, having many fragments: that the extension be less, and the alleviation more gentle to you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the knee there is something from the operation which is over the arm: and it is that when you equal the bandages, and have completed all your operation, then grasp two strips of pinewood, which are administered in the making of sandals which are put under boards: and they are made from the nails of the palm: and choose from those which have a small thickness, and do not be from the small ones: and let the length of them be according to the length of the knee from the knee to below
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	And then cover over one and a half fingers with two layers of bandage according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And put one part of the knee from one side, and the other from the other side: and they are from the knee until below the foot
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	And then ligate two bands in three places from two extremities and the middle
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When the limb is bound up, the knee bends to the right and left, and remains in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed a bandage is administered from wood according to the length of the knee, and is put in the knee, so as to keep it still
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is necessary above all, that you make the limb whole when it is fractured when its own bone is broken
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Consider the crura every day, and study them with the utmost care from the apostemate, or inflation, or any other thing.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If anything happens to them, then oppose it with that which is appropriate, until it is healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Concerning fractures of the bones of the foot and fingers.</start_of_turn>
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.</start_of_turn>
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The calcaneus bone does not usually fracture through.</start_of_turn
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot sometimes fracture, and the fingers also sometimes fracture: and they do not fracture except in the event of a violent impact in various positions.</start_of_turn
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If the bones of the foot fracture, and you wish to elevate them above the level of the heart, then put the patient's foot on the prepared earth, like a walker.</start_of_turn
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand still, and place your foot on that which will elevate these bones: then press down, or place a weight on it: and keep it equal, until it returns to its place.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put on a bandage, and apply a cushion on top: and place under the foot a board which has two flat heads.</start_of_turn
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind up the foot securely with a bandage, after you have enveloped it with cloth and other things as needed.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligament.</start_of_turn
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For indeed you will find the bones even, whether they are fractured or dislocated.</start_of_turn
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The treatment for this is like that for an abscess.</start_of_turn
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If, however, any fingers are fractured, then restore them and keep them equal to one another as I have told you concerning the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Restore the fingers to their original position according to the length of the fingers, and make them equal to one another: then place under the hand the board which I have mentioned, and bind them securely with a suitable bandage.</start_of_turn>
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If two, or three, or more bones are fractured, then place over every finger a bandage of the same quantity, enclosed in linen: and bind the board to the lower part of the foot. Let the upper part of the board rest outside the foot, so that it may support the fracture adequately.</start_of_turn>
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	Remember also what I have said concerning all the other fractures caused by accidents which we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with what is necessary.</start_of_turn>

Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the forearm of a woman is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.</start_of_turn
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her towards the part of the back which is towards her, and support her backwards.</start_of_turn
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife put her forearm across her breast, until she has placed her hand: and make the forearm like a sphere.</start_of_turn
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then bind the woman, and elevate her back gradually.</start_of_turn
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	This is how the bone will be restored, until the fractured bone returns to its normal position.</start_of_turn
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a cushion on her back.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When he wishes to urinate, he should move his buttocks easily, then urinate: and reduce himself afterwards in the manner in which he introduced himself at the beginning. Then he should return to his original position.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Do this every seven days, or thereabouts, and his bones will be restored in this way.</start_of_turn>
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take the bladder and suspend its outlet above its opening with a barley straw tube, and introduce the bladder completely into its belly.</start_of_turn>
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow air into the tube with force, until the bladder is inflated inside the belly, and the fracture returns.</start_of_turn
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then implement it with the buttocks, and keep it for a few days, as we have narrated, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the breastbone of a man or a woman is fractured, then administer to its restoration, and to it apply the same thing which we narrated concerning the bone of the armpit.</start_of_turn
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in its nearby fractures, which are few in number, especially among those who have something to study or do.</start_of_turn
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.

¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Regarding the restoration of bone fractures when there is a wound.</start_of_turn
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for him whose fracture has happened with a wound, especially if it is great, such as a thigh bone or a buttress or the like thereof, to make an incision immediately: if these conditions of the incision are attested.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If blood flows from the wound, then it is necessary, that you make an incision above it, in order that the powder should be poured over it: if nothing else is present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then commence to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not delay it, if it does not happen spontaneously.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed spontaneous healing has occurred, then suspend the restoration until the ninth day, until the swelling has subsided.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth day in any way, for you will cause him to suffer further harm.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If indeed the fractured bone is prominent above the skin detected: then it is necessary, that you reduce it and make it even with your hands with ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If indeed it is not prepared for extension with your hands, and its equalization with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of this it is necessary for the physician, that he take from these three, or four according to the quantity that he needs for the care of every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And be rounded: and be in such a small size, that it does not double under compression over it in the hour of operation: and be acute at the extremities, which have a margin at their extremities
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And be above it to the height from the middle to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.</start_of_turn>
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that you place the acute curvature of the limb at the extremity of the prominent bone: and push it in with the same, until the bone returns and is equal in height to the surrounding parts.</start_of_turn>
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	So do you make the extremities of the fracture equal to each other.</start_of_turn
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its extremities are fractured slightly, and do not grasp well with the instruments, then you must cut off the extremity of that bone, until the instrument has sufficient power.</start_of_turn
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed we are unable to reduce them as we have said, then cut through it with the instrument which we mentioned before: or grasp it with a clamp in any convenient way.</start_of_turn
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then remain only the rough parts of the bone and the small pieces of cortex.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone has been reduced and has been found to be loose after reduction, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.</start_of_turn
Fac ergo illud.	Do this.</start_of_turn>
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great pain on the sick man when you complete your restoration of the bone.</start_of_turn
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then soak the bandage in lukewarm black wine.</start_of_turn
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And in summer it is proper.</start_of_turn
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place upon the wound a greasy ointment, or anything containing oil: so that it does not cause it to become infected and corrupted.</start_of_turn
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the stars at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And discharge the wound detected: thus, that you may cut with scissors the opening in the incisions according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take care of all precautions, that you do not tighten the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many have done this carelessly, and they have caused many patients to suffer either death or decay or corruption, that is, harm.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And be your stricture soft, gentle, diverse from the strictures of the remaining fractures
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or if it is large, and the times are great for some harmful events which we have mentioned, and if you find pain in the place of suspension: then it does not suffice to put on the stars over it
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for it incisions from hard papers in the place of the stars, and string it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, a day or two have passed, and the wound has begun to heal, so that pus is generated: then remove the paper which you put over it with wine
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer balsam and unguents which are customary to us, to soothe the wound: such as the balsam of tetrapharmacon, and the like of it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is convenient for you to dissolve the ligamentum
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus may flow downwards with ease
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If the wound passes many days and does not consolidate, neither does the pus separate from it: then you know that there is a fracture of the bone there
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why should one inquire about a wound with a tentacle?
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of these tentacles are separated from the wound, remove them and extract them themselves.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And what remains of them which is not separated, and which pricks the limb, and causes them to swell, endeavor to cut them out, and remove them in every way possible for you
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens that a wound is bitten by a dog, or has worms, that is, swelling, or some other corruption and decomposition: then it is necessary to oppose each of these with what is appropriate for it in its treatment, as is narrated in its chapter
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And concerning this, as to what I have said before, and to which you must pay attention when a bone is fractured, and protrudes beyond the limb, such as the thigh bone, and joints, and similar parts of great limbs, do not presume its attraction, for much harm often happens from this moisture, indeed sometimes it is better to let it go rather than to retain it until it has decomposed
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall away by itself after eighty days, or a hundred.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then indeed care for the wound, if you see it: and otherwise, let it go.

Consider therefore, if the wound is still bleeding: administer in it medicines which have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Consider therefore, if the wound is still bleeding: administer some or all of these things: and mix them with a styptic liquid, or with albumin or vinegar: and apply them over the wound and bind them securely.</start_of_turn>

Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	For one, there are many causes of loosening of the ligament and its ligation which are not according to what is necessary: either because of the excess tension of the ligaments, until it hinders the circulation of nourishment to the limb: or because of the excessive quantity of superfluous dressing: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the patient, and its weakness.</start_of_turn

When a limb has been restored after healing from a fracture, and when the fractured bone or joint remains bent: and it is pained through that, but the limb is not prohibited from its natural action: then it is not necessary to break the limb again for that reason
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there are many proud doctors and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is very dangerous, often leading to death or great fear, as indeed it is mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the fracture and bending are recent: then it is necessary to anoint with warm water in which decoctions of emollient herbs are boiled, such as rue leaves, and the root of it, and honey, and similar things
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make for him a plaster with a soothing plaster, such as gypsum made into a center
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the slime of the rue root, and mix it with chicken fat, or with beeswax: and plaster with that
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take figs of gum, and mix them with meal, and things of that kind which are named by doctors to decrease consolidation
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	When the nodulation is resolved with persistent friction, ancient and gentle, which occurs with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	The movement of the limb is administered to every part at all times of the day.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If, however, stiffness has preceded it [the swelling], and has become strong, and has become congealed in stone, and has necessitated treatment with an instrument: then it is necessary to cut above it [the swelling], to resolve the continuation of the bone, and to remove what is superfluous from the nodulation or bone with fine scissors: and this should be administered with attention and care
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Regarding the dislocation.</start_of_turn>
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.</start_of_turn>
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of any articulation from its place.</start_of_turn
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prohibited from its movement, and deforms the figure of the limb.</start_of_turn
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes the occurrence of excessive pain, and serious injuries.</start_of_turn
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When, therefore, such a dislocation has happened, then it is necessary to hasten to restore it: and do not delay at all.</start_of_turn
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place is apt to become stiff, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.</start_of_turn
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not necessary to move or extend it in the hour following its displacement.</start_of_turn
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it causes many to suffer spasm and painful sensations.</start_of_turn
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when it has happened, then it is necessary to order a bloodletting of the patient.</start_of_turn
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	And afterwards let it be allowed to rest until the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb is bound with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it is reduced with ease
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And all the limb is cared for so that its memory remains in its place
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I command that the head of the dislocation be reduced, even as has been said in the fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the care of the dislocation of the lower jaw
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Rarely do two mandibles dislocate except for a little while.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is done according to one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are moved from their places with a small removal, and are softened around
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely, without any removal, until they are softened up to the breast, until the saliva of the infirm person softens them, and they are unable to hold it together, and are unable to close their own mouth, and their tongue is swollen with the saliva
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation is slight, then it returns by itself in various positions with little effort
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If however the dislocation is complete, entire: then it must be immediately administered, and not delayed: and it is necessary that the minister of the infirm person should hold the hand of the hand which is near to the dislocation of the mandible between the bones of the dislocation, if the dislocation has occurred from one side only
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he may insert two fingers of his hand together if the dislocation has occurred from both sides
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of the fingers of his hand remain outside, which is equal
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the patient to loosen their teeth and make them capable of biting throughout.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician must stabilize the jaw and press it until it returns to its place
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are simultaneously displaced: then apply heat with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: neither reduce them both at once, as we have said
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they have returned and are aligned, and the patient's bone is closed, and they are not softened: then place over the teeth pieces of wool felt, with wax that has been made from beeswax: and oiled with rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	And it is bound with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the patient should rest on their back: and their head should be fixed between two cushions, so that it does not move to the right or left: neither should they be forced or commanded to bite: rather let them take a soft diet, until when they feel relief from the pain, and the jaw is relaxed: then they may eat what they wish, and this should be administered with ease
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	They should not toil over their oral surgery with eating and drinking, and with biting, until the jaw is healed and restored
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of both jaws is difficult, when they are displaced at some time and do not return to their place: then many times they cause fever, and bitter soda: and perhaps the patient's condition improves, and perhaps vomiting pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you have done this: then you know that it is lost, and many people die from it within a month
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	(The text continues with further instructions regarding the reduction of dislocation of the jaw and the extremity of the humerus.)
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The thyroid bone is not displaced from the inside outwards, because of its continuity with the sternum.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	It is displaced sometimes towards the outside: and this is declared by sensation
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	Its restoration is that the patient should lie upon his back, and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then cover the place with the palm of your hand with a strong bandage, for it will itself return
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put upon it a compress, and sponges, and bind it around it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of it which follow the elbow, and which continue with it, are not displaced, except rarely
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is displaced on some other day: then it is necessary to reduce it and make it equal according to what has been said, and to prepare the patient for it
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put upon it a compress, and sponges, and bind it around it
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until he is healed
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when the same cure has been made, the extremity of the humerus is separated even from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the humerus
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You know that the humerus is not displaced except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of them is that it is displaced towards the elbow towards the lower parts.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	Secondly, it is necessary to displace the fragment to the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	It is also possible to displace it to the upper part of the arm: and that is done rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	It does not go to the back because of the spleen
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	It does not go to the front because of the nerves
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	Most frequently, however, it is displaced downwards towards the nipple: especially in those whose flesh is sparse.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it comes out quickly and goes in quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those, on the other hand, whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, for it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And sometimes it happens to some people that they receive a blow or suffer a fall, and the arm is dislocated by the heat, and it is supposed that because of this the arm is dislocated
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore it is necessary to experience this until you are certain that it is truly dislocated, and then you can proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	It is recognized as being dislocated when it is displaced downwards towards the nipple: and you must distinguish between a dislocated arm and a healthy arm.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find among them a clear difference, and you will find in the head of the arm a depression and under the nipple at the touch of the hand almost like two bones joined together: and you will not be able to reduce the arm to its normal position, neither by pulling nor by any movement
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And in the same way, if it is displaced towards the breast or upwards: then you will find a clear mark, and it will not be hidden
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And in this case of dislocation, the reduction is easily accomplished when the limb is still firm or when the patient is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And the reduction is to elevate the limb upwards by the hand of the minister
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your thumbs under the joint, and elevate the limb with force upwards to its place: and the minister will elevate the hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place the lower limb below, and immediately the limb will return to its place.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however it does not return by this, and has been since the dislocation several days: then it is necessary to immerse the patient in warm water, and to apply a bandage which will soften and soothe, like decocting wild herbs, rue and melilot in water, and applying these things
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient is placed on his back: and under the joint is placed a sphere and a bandage, which is equal between softness and tension
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician places his heel on the sphere, and elevates the arm with force, and pulls the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another minister holds the patient's head, so that it does not move downwards: and immediately it returns to its place
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if necessary, reduce it in this way: make the stronger limb of the patient to be standing on the side, and let it intrude the arm under the patient's joint: and elevate the joint upwards until the patient is suspended in the air
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another minister pulls the patient's hand downwards into his body.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the patient is light: then it is necessary to suspend him with something else, in order to lighten him: for the dislocation will immediately return.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	Also, it is reduced in another way: as when a long stick is placed in the ground, its head being rounded off like a glove of a corpse: neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then it is placed under the patient after the stick's head has been covered with soft cloth: and the patient will be resting in accordance with the length of the stick.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand is extended downwards from the other side, and his body is extended from the other side with force: for the suture returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then take care of it thus: take a stick whose length is equal to the distance from the elbow to the wrist, and whose width is equal to the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger, and whose thickness is equal to the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the index finger: and its head shall be rounded off, so as to facilitate its entrance into the depth of the wound, in this fashion
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then the soft cloth is placed over the rounded head of the stick, so that it does not irritate the patient's wound
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it is placed under the wound, so that the hand or arm is extended over the stick down to the lower parts: and the stick is bound to the aid and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm is placed over the edge of the step for the width of the hand, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is suspended from the other side
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The suture will enter immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When it has been completed as much as possible according to any method: then it is necessary to place under the wound a sphere equal in quantity to the wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a prepared plaster made from pounded wool with oil and white of egg over the whole arm, as is usual above
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten the string under the nail: and the ligament will be returned over the cartilage above: and its hand will be connected to its column and let go, neither hand moving for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	It is necessary to put nourishing food in the mouth of the patient until the limb is comfortable: because it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then put on a wider dressing after seven days, or five, and it is taken away when there is movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is firm and does not soften, then it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If, however, the suture is torn away many times, because of the humidity which has happened to it, or for another cause: then it is necessary to administer cautery with three holes in it, as is prescribed in the chapter on cautery
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If one does all this, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the suture is not confirmed, and the cartilage and the stricture above it are reduced, and it does not harden, and falls away, and cannot be raised up to the upper part: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus are either cut, or stretched, or softened: and you know that the suture will never take hold in its place again
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	As for a dislocation which happens at the shoulder and the armpit, or to the back: it is reduced with a push and an extension with the hands: until it returns, and cautery is administered in the remaining stricture and care, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing there is greatness in the limb, and slowness in its movement: then the patient is put into a great bath, until the greatness is softened, and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	(The text provided does not include information regarding the curation of a dislocation of the cubit.)
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the dislocation of the cubit is difficult, and returns with difficulty: and it is displaced to all parts, especially towards the front or the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	Its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it lies under the skin and under the touch, according to whatever form it is displaced
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you unite the displaced cubit with the healthy, you must declare that to be visible
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	It must be united again, and you must not double the arm, nor touch it with the other arm.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you do this promptly, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before swelling sets in
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if swelling sets in, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it will not be healed at all, especially when it is towards the back
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	It is harmful in all kinds of dislocations, and increases pain: and it descends very much with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it when it is possible to reduce it, is that you extend the limb with two hands: and the arm is expanded, and the hands of the physician are above the elbow and under it, and he pushes with the thumbs of both hands simultaneously, or with the root of the palm of his hand, until it returns to its place
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or else the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns in such a way that you double the hand with the hand of the patient, until it reaches the displaced cubit with the root of the palm of the hand
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	Which if it does not yield to reduction, then administer violent extension, with force: and it is that two ministers extend the limb: and they hold it firmly also, so that it does not move during the extension
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is returned to its entirety after it has been folded over the hand, and a broad ligament is doubled in length, or a wide ligament is stretched.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	When the doctor grasps the hand with his grasp, let him smear it with oil: that it may be from that which will aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then the grasp is driven forward with a violent push, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to place upon it a dressing, in which there is stypticity, and drying with alum: and tighten the constriction slightly.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm is suspended from the collar of the infirm person: and omit for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is healed
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If, however, the joint remains fixed in its place, then solve the ligament from it, and omit it
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you do not bind the joint well, then repeat the dressing, and the ligament, and omit it for a few days, until it is bound
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then it is healed.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, there should happen to him greatness after the reduction of the joint, and the position is immobile: then manage moisture in the bath, and slight friction, and compression, until it is aligned, or place over the joint a cushion of wool, that is, fat of sheep.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is bound, and omit it over night and day
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove the bandage, and introduce it into the bath
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it is wet, then gently friction the joint with temperate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	And repeat over it again oil once, and twice, and thrice with the introduction of the bath, until it is softened
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	If necessary, place upon the stool a cushion, wet, warmed with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do it thus.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	The swelling itself will soften, and will return to its normal state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	From the treatment of dislocation of Almahassem
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The limb of Mahassem is much dislocated, that is, the junction between the arm and the hand
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Except for the remaining joints
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it must be known that speed is in the reduction of its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before it is set in place: or else it will happen that in setting it will cause stiffness.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of its dislocation is like this: place the lower limb of Mahassem upon a board, and extend the hand: and the doctor places his palm upon the prominence of the junction and urges it until it returns
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	It must be known that the hand must not be forced backwards towards the belly: then the infirm person should place the back of his hand upon the board alongside the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation has arisen from the back of the hand, then let the position of the hand be inside the board, that is, let the inner part of the hand be placed upon the board, so that the hand of the doctor may rest upon the prominence of the junction
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good: and if not, then bind the limb with a bandage while it is being set: and let it go, do not do it again
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate it, neither can you force further reduction of it after a few days: indeed, the joint will remain bent according to its own crookedness: and it does not harm the infirm person anything, except that it makes the hand stiff, and you must not bind anything: know that it has slipped away, or that there is swelling
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is no natural opening in it, except that it be bound with a cautery near the case.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	It may perhaps suffice without that.</start_of_turn>
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When the soul does not return, then place above it a plaster as we have described.</start_of_turn>
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	It is then bound and left for five days: afterwards it is dissolved and dismissed, and the hand is exercised.</start_of_turn
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If, however, its movement is withheld, and something heavy has happened in it: then soften it with warm water and friction until it is softened.</start_of_turn
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	(Continuation of previous sentence)</start_of_turn>
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.</start_of_turn>
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When the Digit has been displaced from its place towards the whole of the limb, or from the back of the palm of the hand, or from the inside of the limb: then extend the Digit and drive out the displacement with your thumbs, until it returns.</start_of_turn
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the Digit, and suspend it over the part from which it was displaced, and leave it for two days.</start_of_turn
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is straight on that day.</start_of_turn
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night comes, bind it according to what has been narrated: and do not stop dissolving it until the next day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.</start_of_turn
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for a few days, until it is bound.</start_of_turn
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with the ulnar bone if it is displaced to the inside of the hand: and bind it to the part itself, and do the operation as before, until it heals.</start_of_turn
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	Likewise do as with it when it is displaced to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Likewise do as with it when it is displaced to the other parts.
Caput XXXI.	Likewise do as with it when it is displaced to the other parts.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When anything of the spine of the back, or the neck, is completely displaced, or when many spinal processes are displaced from their places: in such a case there is no cure for it, because the marrow is softened for the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of it is that the sickness departs without being willing, and cannot be held back: and many times it softens some limb of it, or two limbs of it, or two arms of it, or one of its bones: or it displaces one of its vertebrae from its place
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many times it displaces, because many times it is displaced to four parts
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	The one which is displaced to the back is called gibbousness.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure for it is, if the gibbousness happened from infancy: then there is no cure for it, and no healing from it at all
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in such a case as happens by blow, or by percussion, or in like manner, as the ancients said in a long discourse about the methods of treatment.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Most of them do not return when the treatment is finished
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I myself, however, have abbreviated this, because of my proximity to the matter: and I have shown it in a different way from how it was shown by them, and I have made an instrument out of it in a different way from how they made it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say, therefore, that in the gibbousness which happens from the front part, there is neither wisdom, nor healing from it
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	Likewise, in whatever is done to the two sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	It does not matter from which side, except that which happens in its own place, as I have said: and that is, that the patient should be extended over his face towards the platform near the wall; and let the instrument be extended under him, so that it does not irritate his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then place a fixed stool of wood in the fire in the ground, at the foot of the bed, round about the head of him: and another stool of wood round about the feet at the other foot of the bed: and the minister shall hold the stool, and let it not be fixed in the fire.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other minister shall hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then draw over the head of the patient, and under his chin the ligament is to be made firm: and extend the extremity of the ligament to the limb which is at the head of him: and bind it in that place
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	And bind the other ligament above his shoulders, and above his knees of him, and at his buttocks.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	And gather together all the ligaments, and bind them in the other limb which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	And let all the ministers extend to the part of the limb of the ligament, and do not move the two limbs from their places where they are fixed: indeed they are not to be fixed, as we have said
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician puts his palms on the spine with force, until he returns: or puts them on the chest board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	And then he joins his feet on the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however he does not return by this cure, then take the board whose length is about three arms
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And the cavity in the wall from which we said is close to the patient, is the place where the extremity of the board enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board over the spinous process
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet on the other extremity
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tighten well, until the spinous process is firm, and then return to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	And if you wish, work with the ankle which is involved with your hand: and it is that two boards be placed beside the head of the patient at the end of the two feet, of which the length be the forearm of one hand: and beside the head of these two boards at the end of the two feet.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length which is between every two boards is the palm of one hand: and it is finished in every place where there is a hole, in which the ankle runs: and the board is fixed firmly in the earth much, that it does not move at all
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And introduce the round bone: and it is the ankle in which the ligament is rotated in two holes of the two boards
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its extremity is a hole in which the bone is fixed, whose length is the palm with that which is rotated: and in two other boards is like that
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	And tighten the ligaments which you bound in the patient's chest around the ankle which is at his head: and the ligaments which you bound in his thighs around the ankle which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	And stay at every ankle minister, who will twist his hand with a loop, with which the ankle is rotated: and the physician will equal the spinous process, as we said before
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the ankle which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, once Spondilis has returned and the place is equal, it is necessary to place a plaster of dried exsiccata with albumin.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, plaster.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the plaster a bandage of tabula, whose width is three fingers, or thereabouts.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length as much as covers the part of Gibbositatis, and over the healthy part of Spondilis
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the ligament which we mentioned
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient is kept nourished with a mild diet until he is healed
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	And if anything remains prominent in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines which soften and soothe, along with the administration of tabula as mentioned for a long time
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And they are administered in that lamina plumbi.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes it happens that prominence appears behind the last part of the spine: and it is thought to be dislocation, and that is the bone which is now prominent
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not proper to make a presumption of it with this medicine: perhaps because of that it may cause death
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Of the treatment of dislocated Anchae.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that the dislocations of the Anchae and of the humerus do not happen except in dislocation: neither does it happen except in the case of a slight displacement and a concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the dislocation of the Anchae is divided into four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated towards the front and towards the back
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Most often it is displaced inwards: little displacement is to the front, and little to the rear.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment of such displacement inwards is: for when you join the limb of the sick with that of the sound, the latter is longer: and the knee of the sick limb is more prominent than that of the sound limb, and the sick limb cannot double its foot at the ankle: and the place which follows the ankle after displacement is the knee of the hip, because the head of the hip is then carried there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	The sign of its displacement outwards is that its accidents are contrary to those of its displacement inwards.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	The sign of its displacement forwards is that it expands the sound limb alongside its complement: truly it does not double itself without pain in the knee: and if it attempts to walk, it cannot do so forwards: and it retains its urine, and its ankle is displaced, and at walking there is swelling of its heel
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of its displacement backwards is that it does not expand the knee, neither can it double itself before it doubles the ankle: and its limb is even shorter than the other: and the ankle is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of the hip bone
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this displacement of various kinds is that it must be reduced immediately, if the displacement is old, which has become accustomed to its being there
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer the reduction and it remains according to its position: then there is no healing in that treatment at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	It does not suffice that a presumption should be made of it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case in which the displacement is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of displacement: then it is proper for this purpose that you wish to join, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left: perhaps thereby it will return, and no other treatment will be necessary.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare the strong minister and extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands or with a ligament which is bound above his knee: and another minister extends his hand above, so that he may insert his hand under his buttocks.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then bind it with a soft ligament above the root of the hip, and keep the extremity of the other ligament fixed.</start_of_turn>
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension be either from the front of the groin to the part of the shoulder blade, or from the back to the part of the loin.</start_of_turn>
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension be all at once, until the patient raises himself with his body from the earth, and remains hanging.</start_of_turn>
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this is indeed a common kind of extension among the four kinds.</start_of_turn>
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If, therefore, the dislocation returns as we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary in every case to perform that which we have mentioned concerning proper treatment.</start_of_turn>
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reducing it, however, when the dislocation has gone inwards, it is necessary that the patient be placed upon his sound side.</start_of_turn>
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then bind the ligament upon the root of the hip, in that place which is between the head of the hip and the groin.</start_of_turn
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the shoulder blade.</start_of_turn
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	And then another strong minister grasps his arm and moves the lower part of the hip downwards, and extends it outwards.</start_of_turn
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	And thus it returns to its place.</start_of_turn
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	This kind is easier than the others for treating this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, it is excused beyond thy power, and does not obey thee at the entrance with this kind of treatment: then it is necessary to bind together both feet of the sick person along with strong ligament, soft and strong, over two calcanei and over two knees: and let the length of each be equal to four fingers; and let the limb which is sick be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then suspend the limb above the head of the limb: and let its length from the earth be equal to the quantity of two arms
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong youth to hold fast the hip: and suspend it with the sick limb together: and let the youth push the other limb forward with force, so that the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in its return itself, when there is dislocation outwards, it is necessary that the limb should lie upon a cushion, as we have said in the case of a gibbosity
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And bind the ligament over the limb itself, and over the hip.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	And put two boards, one at the feet and the other at the head of the limb.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	And put a board added in the middle of the foot, fixed well: over which are placed wet cloths, so that it does not irritate the limb: and let the board be between the knees, so that it does not draw towards the lower parts on extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then extend all the limbs to their proper parts, and the physician will equal the reduction by his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it obeys the reduction, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place over the limb itself a board, and press on it, as we said in the case of a gibbosity, equally
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	The patient must lie upon his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	When the dislocation is forward, then it is necessary to extend the limb quickly: and it is in accordance with this that the doctor places his right hand over the patient's knee
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he grasps the limb with his other hand, and when he has bound it in this way, he extends the limb downwards to the knee part
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	If the dislocation is backwards: then it is not necessary to extend the limb downwards, but rather to elevate it above the ground: indeed it is necessary to place it upon a firm object, as it is also done when the dislocation is wide outwards, as we have said concerning its recumbent position upon two cushions: and this is upon its face and with extended ligaments: as we said a little while ago.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	It is necessary to apply a compress with a board also upon the place where the fracture has occurred, when the reduction is completed as it should be done.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden: and it is that you extend both legs of the patient: and when you remove these equal, and the patient tightens his limb and expands it without pain: then you know that the limb is returned, as it should be done: then you must join the two thighs together, and put on an bandage, and bind as before, that is, with a rotation: so that it does not move widely to any part: and the patient must rest quietly for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament and the bandage, and compare the limb with the other: then if you find them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation is fixed: absolutely so that the patient can walk again.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you find any softening: then rest, put on the bandage once more, and bind it as before: and leave it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable.
Caput XXXIII.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable.

Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable
Deinde solue ea.	Then heal it and make it walk slowly over the next few days until it is comfortable.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	Neither does the sickly man walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, the limb remains immobile, you must perform reduction of the limb with ligaments, as has been mentioned previously in the treatment of fractures, until it returns
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Until it returns
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes remoulded with a slight displacement, and sometimes dislocates completely
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	It is displaced either inwards or outwards
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	Its sign is that the calcaneus is swollen, proceeding to the part where it is displaced
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its displacement is easy: to restore it, extend it gently with the hands, and stabilize it until it returns to its place
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	When it is completely displaced, it is necessary to sit the patient upright: and hold the limb firmly from behind its ankle, in the middle of the limb itself
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold your right hand from above the foot, and your left hand from below the foot at the ankle bone
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	And with your left hand support the ankle bone with two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with your left hand, and push the ankle bone downwards without straining.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice as we have mentioned
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the ankle bone towards the shin in the third space, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns to its place either in one space or in two, according to this method, and if the foot is equal, it is good: but if not, do the operation again over it: because it will return
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, it is forbidden to reduce it [the swelling] with that which we have mentioned: then make the patient lie upon his back upon the earth, and fix a pillow under his feet, so that it shall fall between his thighs. And you shall be covering over him with your hand, so that it does not injure the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then take hold of his thigh: afterwards extend the other limb, either with your hands or with a bandage which is tied about the ankle
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then extend all the limbs against the extension of the limb: and the pillow shall be standing between the two thighs of the patient, holding him, so that it does not draw his body downwards towards the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician must adjust the dislocation with his hands, and the other limb must be held at the ankle.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When the dislocation has returned, and it is declared that the limb is in a state of recovery: then apply a plaster and bandage, and bind the limb firmly with ligaments, and bind the foot to the ankle
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary to beware of the nerves which are above the heel behind, so that there is no tension on the ligaments over them, and that it does not injure them
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	And discharge him in two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, bind it: then dissolve it on the third or fourth day: and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he nevertheless attempts to walk before that space of time, there is no security that the dislocation will be dissolved and will not be corrupted, and will not recover after that treatment
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If he has a cold swelling: then it is necessary to administer for its sedation in that place where our narration proceeded elsewhere for the treatment, and embrocation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On dislocation of the toes and their treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 5.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that the dislocation be reduced without great pain, for this is not difficult but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If, however, the dislocation is in some part of the ankle: then it is necessary to make the patient sit with the foot resting on the ground or on a table: and to be able to walk again
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you must stand, and put your foot on that which is between the joints
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then lift up your foot with your foot until you feel it is equal, and does not appear elevated
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the middle of the foot a board which can support the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then let it rest, and make it quiet from walking for many days, until it is bound up and secure against reduction
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the varieties of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 6
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something like this happens, and you know its cure and its restoration, many times a wound follows: and because of this it is not proper to be proud of your cure, which is indeed useful only when a wise man of long experience, merciful, compassionate, punctual, not cowardly, not arrogant, is found: and that he should learn from the mistakes of other doctors who sit on their laurels only for a little warmth: and that he should send the patient away with a good judgement
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you believe, or hope for the healing of the wound with lenity of treatment, and in which something appears of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Attempt to reduce it immediately at the outset of the operation, before the swelling becomes cold.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If the limb has returned, as we wish, then institute a regimen that will quiet the swelling: and care for the wound with those things which are suitable for it from the drying unguents.</start_of_turn>
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with fracture, and the fragments lie apart in the marrow, then attempt to remove them, and make in that which we said in simple fractures from that which preceded in their places.</start_of_turn>
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be cautious according to your skill, and protect yourself from the entrance of fear: according as I have foretold you.</start_of_turn>
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For it is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more healthy for your body in this life.</start_of_turn
