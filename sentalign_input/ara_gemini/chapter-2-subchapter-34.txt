The thirty-fourth chapter on cutting the ligament that appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This frenulum that appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has healed.
The procedure for it is to open the patient's mouth with his head in your lap and lift his tongue, then cut that frenulum transversely until the tongue is released from its restriction.
If there is some hardness and knotting in it, and that is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and incise it transversely until the frenulum is severed and the knot is loosened.
Beware that the incision is not deep in the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and cause bleeding.
Then he should rinse his mouth after the cutting with rose water or with vinegar and cold water.
Then place a wick of linen under the tongue, which the patient holds every night so that it does not reattach.
If bleeding occurs, put powdered vitriol on the area.
If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the area with a lenticular cautery suitable for that, then treat it with all other treatments until it heals.
