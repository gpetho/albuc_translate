Chapter Forty-Five:
On the cauterization for ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines protrude before the hernia, and this is just beginning, it is necessary to tell the patient to stop eating on that day and use gentle substances to help the hernia descend from the abdomen.
Then place the patient on their back between your hands, and instruct them to hold their breath until the hernia or intestines appear.
Then return it with your fingers and mark with ink the rupture over the bone of the groin with a sign whose end resembles half a circle in the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which is shaped like this:
Until it is very red and emits sparks.
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery on the mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and keep it there until you reach the bone of the groin, and repeat if you haven't reached the bone the first time.
And wisely observe the emergence of the intestine during the cauterization, so as not to burn the intestine and cause death or other serious harm to the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation will not be effective.
And the cautery for children should be delicate according to their size and measurement.
Then treat the cautery site for three days with butter until the scar from the burn is removed.
Then treat it with other ointments until it heals.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound and the place are sealed.
And it is necessary to adjust their nutrition according to the length of their healing time to support their abdomen, and to prevent the intestine from protruding during the recovery effort.
And when they want to get up after forty days, provide them with decent support, and keep them under observation for another forty days.
And they should refrain from labor, overeating, drinking, and loud voices, for if they follow this regimen of complete healing, they will be cured.
And I will describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen. If you want to prevent them from protruding at the beginning, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, ensuring that about a third of the skin is removed. Then treat it with what we have mentioned, and it will not be retracted.
Some earlier practitioners have said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this shape, as it is marked with a probe:
A line is placed horizontally on the upper side of the rupture, and another line above; then place your hand with a nail-like cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
