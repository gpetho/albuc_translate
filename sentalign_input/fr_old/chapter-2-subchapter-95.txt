Of the common veins of the body
Of the veins from which bloodletting is done, there are thirty-one, of which sixteen are in the head,
namely: two that are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech";
and the two arteries that are in the two visible temples;
and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires";
and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose;
and the two jugular veins that are in the neck;
and the two veins that are in the upper lips, which are called "augeherich";
and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins commonly used for bloodletting are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and it is on the left side, and the lay people call it "vein of the head";
and the middle one is called "faste", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic,
and the lay people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side,
and the lay people call it "vein of the belly", and it is on the cubit,
and it is the one used for bloodletting, which appears clearly on the forearm.
And the salvatelle is the vein that is between the little finger and the ring finger, and has two branches;
and in the leg and the foot are three veins: one is under the curve of the calf on the left side,
and the second is the saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein that is called "nesse", which is at the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
The bloodletting of the veins that are behind the ears helps with old catarrh, and migraine;
and the quality of the bloodletting, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head,
and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then squeeze the patient's neck with a band,
until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places dependent on the head:
find them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, then bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and insert it under the vein to the bone, then raise your hand with the vein upward,
and cut both the skin and the vein well for two fingers' breadth, and let as much blood flow as you want;
then compress and tie it, until it is healed;
and I have already discussed incision and cauterization in the first book.
The bloodletting of the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for old migraine,
and sudden migraine, and chronic eye inflammation, and acute tearing in the eyes;
and the quality of the bloodletting is as I say:
and it is that the patient squeezes his neck, until the two veins appear clearly;
and feel the pulse under your finger, then bleed from there;
then lift the skin over the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet below,
and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you did with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then untie the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then place cotton on it;
then tie it tightly, and leave it until it is healed; and we have already discussed their cutting and extraction at the beginning of the book.
The bloodletting of the vein of the forehead is as valuable as the bloodletting of the cephalic for old face diseases, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the quality is that the patient squeezes his neck while twisting, until the vein appears;
then take the instrument called "fosseur", of which here is the shape:
And place the point on the vein, and strike it with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow according to the amount you want;
then untie the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed and sometimes work with a wide flame.
However, the flame should not be too sharp; and bleed transversely, because the bone is near, and the flame might break when it is thin.
The bloodletting of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts helps with the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and stye in the eye, and face diseases;
and the quality of their bloodletting is that the patient squeezes his neck while twisting with a band, as before;
then bleed, and let the bleeding be transverse, a little along with a slightly wide flame, because there is no flesh there.
And if the flame is thin, it might break; then let the blood flow, as much as you need, then tie cotton on it, and tie it well.
The bloodletting of the vein of the nose is good for acute, and sudden frenzy, and face diseases,
such as migraine and redness that comes on the face, and especially when it is old;
and the quality of the bloodletting is that the patient squeezes his neck, then squeeze his nose with your left hand,
and take the thin long flame, and insert it in the middle of the upper lip in the space between the two nostrils,
because the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will start flowing immediately;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then tie it for a night, because it heals very quickly;
and here is the shape of the flame:
The bloodletting of the two jugular veins helps with the narrowing of breath, and the onset of measles, and many diseases, and impetigo, and corrosion, and herpes, and scrofula;
and the quality of the bloodletting is that the patient squeezes his neck below one and the other, as we have said;
and the master stands over the patient's head, and the patient sits on a seat,
then bleed the vein lengthwise a little broadly, then draw the blood moderately, or as much as needed;
then do the same to the other vein, then untie the band, and squeeze both veins moderately,
so that the patient does not strangle; and leave it until morning, when the wound is healed.
Of the bleeding of the lips
The bloodletting of the veins in the upper lips helps with bile in the mouth, and gum decay, and cracks in the lips, and nose and around.
And the quality of the bloodletting is to make the patient sit before you, and squeeze his neck as I have said;
then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is on the right lip and the other on the left,
and recognize them because they are black, and because there are small black veins around them:
then cut both, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt,
then cut the largest on each side, and do the same for the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same manner.
Of the bleeding under the tongue
The bloodletting of the veins under the tongue helps after the bloodletting of the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and diseases of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth;
and the procedure is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and raises his tongue, and you look under each side for a black vein:
then bleed both, and do not go too deep, because the arteries are below.
The veins of the elbow from which bloodletting is commonly done are treated in two ways:
either by pricking with a broad myrtle flame, or a fine olive-shaped flame like cutting knives, and it is called "anesil";
and they are broad or fine according to the width and narrowness of the veins.
The shape of the myrtle flame is very renowned, and is broad as you see:
And it is used to open swollen veins full of apparent thick blood, and that contain thick and cloudy blood;
and here is the shape of the olive flame:
and it is more finely pointed, and is for bleeding fine veins, where there is fine citrine blood.
The bloodletting of the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps with diseases that are below the throat, in the neck, in the chest, and in the abdomen;
and it is necessary for the bloodletter to bleed carefully, and to avoid the artery that is below.
And if he cuts the artery, and bleeding occurs, it must be stopped, as I have said;
and the flame should not be pricking, but cutting like an anesil.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, it is necessary to squeeze it, and change to another;
or you seek a branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly;
and cut it with the anesil flame, as we have said.
And if you want to know the place of the bloodletting, it is necessary before squeezing the arm, to touch the place until you know the pulse;
then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the anesil flame;
and beware of hitting the artery when you see the place swelling, because it is from the artery: avoid it then.
And if you see it spurting up like a child's urine, and the blood is red and fine, know that it is arterial blood:
then hasten, and place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens;
then tie the arm, and leave it like this, and do not let the patient move it; and be on guard, and do not let him move it until it is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overwhelms you, and you do not have medicine, then cut the artery if it appears, because the ends will retract; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of pistachio bark, and split it, and take one half and tie it well until the next day;
if the blood stops, that is good; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop bleeding;
and the stopping is not difficult in many situations due to the small place of the wound, and the pressure of the arm band.
The bloodletting of the middle vein helps as it draws blood from the head above, and from the body below,
because it is composed of the basilic and the cephalic, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the bloodletter to avoid the nerve that is below, and if he pricks too deeply, and finds the nerve,
and it swells and the healing is difficult, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve appears many times, and if it does not appear in some people due to its fineness, then it is necessary to bleed it with the anesil instrument; and avoid the nerve as much as you can.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
The bloodletting of the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking with the olive flame or the myrtle flame, because it is the safest of all the veins, as there is neither nerve nor artery below it.
However, it is necessary to seek the lightest place, and it does not matter if one fails the first time, and one tries again;
and perhaps the place swells in some people, when one fails the first time, but it does not matter.
The quality of the bloodletting is according to your thought.
The first thing you should know about bloodletting is that it is administered only to maintain health,
and to avoid future illnesses;
and the bloodletting should be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow: that is, cephalic, median, and basilic;
and one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first or the third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bloodletting that is administered for illnesses has no fixed time, but whenever necessary, day or night, at all hours and at all times;
and children should not be bled until fourteen years old, nor pregnant women except from the fourth month to the seventh.
Nor should old people who have passed sixty years old be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary to cleanse the intestines with a light enema,
if there is a lot of retained feces, so that the veins do not draw the rotten superfluities from the intestines that harm the principal members;
and one who is too full of food, or who is drunk, until it is out, or hydropic, should not be bled;
and one should avoid bloodletting after colic pain, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse, and work, and staying awake, and fasting, and anything that exhausts the strength, whether by soul or body;
then refine the humors, if the blood is thick, by food and drinks and medicines, if you have the power;
then enter the bath, if nothing forbids it, to refine the blood,
and bleed yourself from the vein of the arm around the third hour, as we have said;
and avoid work, and pain, and lust, and similar things that day;
and be happy and joyful, and let the bloodletter be higher than the one being bled, and rub his arm two or three times,
then tie the band above moderately, because if it is too tight or loose, the blood cannot flow;
then rub the place with your hands, until the veins swell, and can be felt;
then the bloodletter moistens the flame with a bit of old oil, then places his left finger on that vein below the place where he wants to bleed,
so that the vein does not flee and avoid the prick.
Because there are veins that flee like cords when being bled, and some that are full of wind,
so that when the flame is applied, it retracts the flame, and the vein cannot open, and so it is with those;
and if it opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore it is necessary for the bloodletter to be aware of these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; if not, then try again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it for one or two days, and do not tie the arm:
perhaps a hot abscess will come; do not enter the bath, then try the bloodletting again if he likes;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows slowly and you doubt that enough blood will come out, then prick in that same opening with the flame directly;
and open it a little quickly, before the place is swollen; because this often happens when the wound is small.
If you see the place swelling, do not start the bloodletting again, and put on a bit of oil dregs, because it relieves the flow of blood, and in this place the dregs are better than the oil;
and thus administer the oil dregs in each bloodletting when you bleed the veins, to stop the flow of blood;
and the same is done by theriac and mud, when applied to the place; it refines the blood and spreads it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess appears, which often happens, especially when it is not bled except at that time when the vein opening is small,
then hasten, and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and a little warm salt, and press it for an hour;
and it is necessary to do this after the flow of blood from the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm him;
and if you wish, put on something of aloe or myrrh mixed in the juice of calamint, mustard, or similar.
And many times an abscess and appearance occur with the bloodletting of the basilic vein: then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft to the touch of the hand, then that appearance is bad.
Avoid then putting on anything of what we have said, because perhaps blood will flow from the artery; but make a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw blood from each according to the amount of his strength, and the color of the blood.
Because if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is refined; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, make a larger wound, and let the flame be broad;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and let him be bled little and often, and bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and cutting the nerve, and is better than longitudinal or broad bleeding.
And for one whose body fails from the bloodletting, give him bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is hot, draw blood three or four times.
And if he is of a cold complexion, let him eat before the bloodletting bread soaked in mulled syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints from the bloodletting, after the flow of much blood, it is necessary for him to inhale meat broth, and a subtle scented syrup,
and use the other things we have said in the division or chapter of syncope, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wants to air his arm, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bloodletting, that he be bled little by little, according to the amount of his strength continuously.
And if he wants to air his arm after the first bloodletting, and he has a strong body, let him be bled seven hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And if he wants to be bled again elsewhere, let him be bled on the second or third day.
Because there is much blood in the body that is already heated, and it causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a large amount, and widen the opening until he falls into a faint;
then you consider all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse when he faints, so that death does not come in place of fainting,
and this often happens, when the bloodletter is negligent;
and it is not necessary when you want to untie the arm, and make the blood flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press firmly on it;
nor if it is curved, that he stretches the arm quickly, because that would be harmful;
but leave it until he bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of the flame, until the blood that is clotted at the opening of the vein flows out,
and put on a bit of salt dissolved in water, and press lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not press it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, bleed in that same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the head vein because it is composed.
And the manner of bloodletting is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the armpit is red;
then tie moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not lengthwise or breadthwise;
and let the opening be large, and let it be bled very near the joint of the hand, and if the blood cannot flow, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, because it is used more in winter than in summer;
and the bloodletting of this vein is safer than all other veins, as there is no artery or nerve.
The bloodletting of the salvatory vein of the right hand is good for all diseases of the liver, and this is the manner:
squeeze the hand, and put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen, so that it is visible;
and bleed it across, and if you cut it completely, it does not matter;
and do not go too deep, because the nerves are all exposed without flesh underneath,
and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is clotted in the wound, and cannot flow out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and salt on the vein to close it quickly, and do the same for each branch.
The bloodletting of the same vein in the left hand is good for the disease of the spleen, and do just as I have told you for the right.
The bloodletting of the saphenous vein is good for all diseases that are below the body,
such as diseases of the womb, retention of menses, diseases of the kidneys, thighs, and old leg ailments, and similar diseases.
And the procedure of its bloodletting is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it appears,
and tie above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and many branches go above the foot;
then bleed the largest branch, or at the ankle, which is very beneficial.
And if you bleed it on the foot, beware of the nerves that are underneath, and bleed it across as if cutting; and let the flame be anesil.
And if the blood cannot flow out, put the foot back in the water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bloodletter fails the first time, start again a second time a little above, because the place is dirty;
and do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and its bloodletting is good for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the procedure of its bloodletting is that the patient enters the bath, and squeezes above the ankle four fingers' width, twisting,
because otherwise the vein does not appear; and if it appears, bleed it in all the ways you can, and across;
and it is much better to cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very well defined in many people.
And if you cannot find it, bleed any branch of it that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and let as much blood flow as you wish, then untie the band, and put on cotton and press it; it is now healed.
