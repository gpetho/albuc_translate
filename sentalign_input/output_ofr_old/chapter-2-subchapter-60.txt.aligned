of the stone	On the extraction of the stone.	0.44146636
We have already discussed in the section on types of stones, and their extraction together with medicines; and have explained the difference between stones generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stones one should operate by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis; and I will tell you plainly and briefly.	We have already in the due place reviewed the different kinds of stone and the medical treatment of them. I mentioned too the difference between stones arising in the kidney and those arising in the bladder, and gave all the symptoms of them. I also mentioned the kind of stone to which manipulation and incision are appropriate. This is in particular the stone arising in the bladder, and the sort impacted in the urethra.	0.8352951
And when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the waste that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.	When we undertake treatment the patient must first have an enema to empty his bowel completely; for sometimes the faeces prevent the calculus being found when it is looked for.	0.73118025
Then take the patient by the feet, and shake him and move him downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes jumps from its high place; then have him sit prepared between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards; then search for it and touch it inside; if you feel the stone in the area, then hurry now to cut into the stone.	Then the patient should be taken by the feet and jarred to and fro and shaken downwards to bring the calculus down into the neck of the bladder; or else let him jump down from a height a number of times. Then have him sit down upright before you with his hands beneath his thighs, to make the whole bladder incline downwards. Then examine him and palpate him externally. If you feel the stone in the empty place, immediately hasten and cut down upon it.	0.88249123
And if it does not fall at the touch at all, wet your index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young man; and insert it in his anus, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, guide it to the neck of the bladder; then press down on your finger, and push it aside where you intend to cut.	But if there is not the slightest sign of it to the touch then you should anoint with oil the forefinger of your left hand if it be a boy, or the middle finger if it be a fully grown young man, and introduce it into the anus and search around for the calculus, until, when it comes under the finger, you can work it slowly towards the neck of the bladder. Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards toward the place where you wish to make your incision.	0.86118424
And instruct the assistant to press on the bladder with his hand, and tell him to raise the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand to pull back the skin that is below the testicles in the area where the incision is made; then insert the cutting spatula, of which this is the form:	And bid an assistant squeeze the bladder with his hand; and bid another assistant raise the scrotum with his left hand and with the other hand stretch the skin under the testicles away from the place where the incision is going to be. Then do you take a lancet like this and make your incision in the space between the anus and the testicles, not in the mid-line but on the side of the left buttock; and cut down upon the calculus itself, keeping your finger in the anus and pressing it outwards.	0.8275768
For those then which have angles and edges, make the incision larger; and if it does not jump out, you must clamp down with forceps which are like a file at the tip, designed to grip the stone so that it does not escape; or you insert a subtle instrument curved at the tip underneath it; and if you cannot grasp it thus, widen the opening a little, and if the blood flows, staunch it with vitriol; and if there is more than one stone, push the largest to the neck of the bladder first, then cut down on it, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are several. And if it is very large, it must be sawn, and a larger wound made.	Then if it still will not come out you must then resort to a deviceâ€” namely to catch hold of it with strong forceps having an extremity like a rasp, to get a tight hold of it so it shall not slip out; or else introduce beneath it a narrow instrument with a crooked end. And if you then cannot get the stone out, widen the incision slightly; and if there is any bleeding stanch it with vitriol. If there should be a number of stones first push the largest of them into the neck of the bladder, then cut down upon it; then push a smaller one down after it; and do the same if there be more than two. But if the stone be very large it is foolish to make a great incision down upon it; for the result is that the patient either dies or has a chronic urinary fistula because the place will not heal at all.	0.90052044
For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly flows out so the wound cannot heal; but nevertheless, strive to pull it out, or to break it up with forceps, until you remove it in pieces; and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with frankincense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and put a cloth soaked in oil and wine over it, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the inflamed area; then lay the patient on his side, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day. And when you unbind it, wash the area very well with oil and water, then treat it with diachylon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.	Try rather to manipulate it so that it protrudes; or else attempt to break it up with the forceps so that you can extract it piecemeal. And when you have completed the operation pack the wound with frankincense and aloes and dragon's blood, and bind it up and apply a pad soaked in olive oil and wine or oil of roses and cold water, to reduce the swelling. The patient should lie flat on his back and the bindings should not be undone before the third day; and when they are undone foment the place with plenty of oil and water. Then dress it with Palm ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.	0.8693304
And if hot abscesses develop in the wound and corrosion, and clotting of blood in the bladder, and because of this the urine is retained, which is recognized in such a way that blood comes out with the urine: then put your finger in the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will corrode the bladder and rot it; then wash the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and help him in all the ways you know, until he is healed; and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you bind his two thighs, and apply the medicines to the area.	If an increasing and cankerous abscess occur in the wound, or anything similar such as clotting of blood within the bladder, with stoppage of the urine (which would be signified by the urine being accompanied by blood) pass your finger into the wound and remove the blood; for if it lies in it it will lead to sepsis and necrosis of the bladder. Then wash out the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and apply whatever treatment is suitable for the case until it heals. Also at all times during treatment his hips should be bound and kept together so that the medicaments applied to the place may not be disturbed.	0.84813595
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and lodged there, and the urine cannot pass; treat him with what I said before, that you cut him many times, though one is excused from cutting by this treatment. I have already tried this thus.	Now if the calculus be small and be impacted in the opening of the urinary passage, preventing the exit of the urine, treat it with the means I am about to describe before you go on to make your incision, for often I have found this treatment suffice without incision; I have experience of this.	0.7451565
Take an iron drill of this shape and let it be three-sided, fixed in a firebrand:	You take a drill of the finest steel, of this shape. It should be triangular at the point and sharp, with a wooden handle.	0.5730202
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder; then insert the drill into the penis gently, until it comes to the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side; then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand over what remains of the stone that is inside the penis.	Then take a thread and with it bind the penis beneath the calculus to prevent the stone from returning to the bladder. Then introduce the iron of the drill gently into the meatus until the drill reaches the stone itself, and then very very gently revolve the drill upon the stone with your hand, and try to perforate it, till you pierce it through to the other side. Then the urine will at once be released.	0.92368746
It is then immediately broken, and comes out with the urine, and the patient is cured; and if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, tie a thread below the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the location of the stone between the two ties, then extract it, and untie the ties, and clean the clotted blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.	Then, with your hand outside the penis, squeeze the remains of the stone, and they will crumble and be washed out by the urine and the patient will be cured. But if this treatment is not possible for you on account of some impediment, then tie a thread beneath the stone and another above; then make an incision down upon the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures, extract it, then undo the ligature and clean away the blood that has clotted in the wound.	0.8897292
