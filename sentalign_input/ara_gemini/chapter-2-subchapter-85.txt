Chapter eighty-five on wounds of the abdomen, protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The hernia that occurs in the abdomen can be large, small, or medium. From a large one, an intestine or several intestines may protrude, making their insertion and suturing more difficult and laborious.
The small hernia can also be difficult in another way, so its reduction is necessarily more difficult, and if the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it swells and thickens, making its insertion difficult. For this reason, the medium hernia is the best, because the reduction of the intestine is not as difficult as in these two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four types: two common sutures are suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing all other wounds of the body, and the other two are specific sutures that apply to all other wounds, except that they are more specific to suturing the abdomen, and I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification.
So I say that if the wound is small and something of the intestine comes out and its reduction is difficult, it is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the hernia, as we said, or because the intestine has been inflated by the cold air. If this is the case, it should be warmed by immersing a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water alone or in which has been cooked zedoary, costus, and spikenard, and dabbing the intestine with it until the swelling subsides. This can also be done with a drink that has astringency, which is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
When you see that the swelling has subsided, wet the intestine with water in which marsh mallow or hollyhock has been cooked, for this will facilitate its entry with the easiest effort.
If its return is difficult after this treatment, then make a small incision in the hernia with the instrument used to incise fistulas. The first treatment, if possible, is better than the incision, and one is only compelled to make the incision after necessity and the failure of other means.
This is a picture of the instrument:
Its one curved side is limited, its other side is unlimited, and the thin end is not as thin as a scalpel but rather slightly blunt, and it is a tool that resembles a small probe, as you see.
So, if the wound widens and the intestine enters, it should be returned to its natural shape and proper place if you are able to do so, for that is best.
However, if the rupture is wide and is in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper abdomen, he should place his head and chest higher than his lower body, and likewise, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, always make your intention and purpose to have the side where the surgery is higher than the other side.
And thus, it should be used in major surgeries and in medium surgeries.
But in small surgeries, you place it according to what is possible for you.
Then you bring before you a gentle servant who holds the entire rupture with his hands and brings its edges together, then reveals it to the one in charge of stitching bit by bit.
And this is the description of the single common stitch, which is that you take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound, then leave from the edge of the rupture a space the thickness of the little finger, and insert a single needle without threading it into the edges of the skin along with the edges of the peritoneum that is under the skin from the inside until you pass it through from that side, having brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers.
Then you tighten with a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound are brought together tightly.
Then you also leave a space the thickness of a finger and insert another needle, then attach it to the thread as you did with the first needle, and continue doing this with the needles you need until you finish stitching the entire wound. 
And let the needles be medium between thick and thin, because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are also difficult to insert into the skin, therefore, they should be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not appropriate to insert the needle into the edge of the skin too close, lest the flesh quickly tear and the wound open before it heals, nor should you stitch too far apart, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Then you cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient while he sleeps, and you make for him supports from pieces of linen on all sides, which hold the ends of the needles, and you leave them until you know that the wound has healed.
This type of stitching with needles is thus more suitable in small surgeries, because it may be sufficient to stitch them with one needle or two or so.
As for the description of the second common stitch, it is that you gather with the stitching the four edges, I mean the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum, at once with a needle containing a twisted thread, moderate in thinness and thickness.
Then, when you have passed the needle through these four edges, you return the needle from the side from which you began, so that the thread lies intertwined from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is like the stitching of the small sacks with which goods are tied, and you make between each stitch and stitch a distance the thickness of the little finger, and this stitching is known by all people.
With this stitching, I stitched a surgery that occurred to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the surgery was more than a span, and about two spans of his middle intestine had come out, and the rupture was in the middle of the abdomen, so I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours, and the wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered, and he lived after that many years, managing all his affairs, and the doctors had judged that he would never recover.
And it is surprising that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there was nothing of the medicines, so I would put worn cotton on the wound twice a day and I would wash it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special stitching, I mention it according to the text of Galen's words, which is that you begin the stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. When you have passed the needle through the skin and the muscle that goes straight along the entire abdomen, you leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside in the other edge of the peritoneum. When you have passed it through, pass it again through this same edge of the peritoneum from outside to inside and leave the edge of the peritoneum that is on this side and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside and pass it, as you pass it through the peritoneum, to the edge of the peritoneum that is on its side until it passes through all of it. Then begin again from this same side and stitch it with the edge that is from the peritoneum on the other side and bring the needle out of the skin that is near it, then return it to that skin and stitch the edge of the peritoneum that is on the other side with this edge of the peritoneum and bring it out of the skin that is on its side. Do this again and do it repeatedly until you stitch the entire surgery according to that example.
The summary of the description of this stitching is that you stitch like furriers stitch furs, by stitching the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leaving it once from the other side until you finish.
As for the second type of special stitching that Galen also mentioned, these are his words verbatim, which is that you stitch it like some of the healers stitch it, by bringing together each part to its similar counterpart naturally, so they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and that is as I describe to you.
It is appropriate that you insert the needle into the edge of the peritoneum closest to you from the outside and pass it through to the inside in it alone and leave the two edges of the peritoneum, then return the needle and pass it from outside to inside in both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again and pass it from inside to outside in the other edge of the peritoneum that is on the opposite side.
And this type of stitching is better than the easy common stitching, which is the stitching that was mentioned previously.
These are Galen's words verbatim.
And some have said that stitching the abdomen may be straightened with two needles, which is that you insert a single thread in them, and you begin by inserting the needle from your side and passing it through to the other side, and you insert the other needle from the opposite side, so you pass it through from your side, like the stitching of bishops, alike.
And know that if the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, its stitching is more difficult than other places of the abdomen.
As for the treatment of the wound, its rule in its treatment is the rule of all other surgeries, which is that if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you have returned the intestine and stitched it and tightened it, then apply to it the healing powders. But if the air has changed the wound, then apply to it some of the ointments that you have prepared until it suppurates and the threads fall out and the peritoneum heals, then treat it as you treat all other surgeries until it heals.
But if you do not have medicines, apply worn cotton to it from the time it begins to suppurate and change it twice a day, as I have informed you, until it heals, for you will not need another treatment in most cases if the surgeries are simple.
If you fear that the major organs will share in the pain of the wound, it is appropriate that you dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit.
If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines, which often occurs, then inject him with a lukewarm black astringent syrup, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and has become a wound penetrating its cavity.
And know that whatever of the intestines is thick is easier to heal, and whatever of them is thin is more difficult to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from any surgery that occurs in it at all, because of the abundance of veins in it and their size, and the thinness of its substance and its proximity to the nature of the nerve.
But if what protruded from the wound is the omentum, and you find it fresh, then return it just as you returned the intestine.
But if some time has passed and it has become green or black, it is appropriate that you tie it with a thread above the place where it has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for there are veins and arteries in the omentum.
Then you cut what is below that ligature and make the ends of the thread hanging from below the surgery, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull it and remove it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates.
Mention of the wound that occurs in the intestine.
But if a small rupture occurs in the intestine, it may be repaired in some people, because I saw a man who had been wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and the wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and wind came out, so I began to treat him although I did not hope for his recovery, but I continued to treat him gently until he recovered and the place healed.
When I saw that the place had healed, I feared that something bad would happen to the patient in his abdomen, but nothing bad happened to him at all, and he remained in the best of his conditions, healthy, eating, drinking, having intercourse, entering the bath, and exercising in his service.
And some of the experienced have mentioned that whenever a small wound occurs in the intestine, it should be stitched in this manner, which is that large-headed ants are taken, then the edges of the wound are brought together, then an ant with its mouth open is placed on the edges of the wound, and when it grips it and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off, for it will stick and not come undone.
Then another ant is placed near the first, and you continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you return it and stitch the wound, for those heads will remain stuck in the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm will occur to the patient at all.
It may also be possible to stitch the intestine with the thin thread that is pulled from the intestine of the animal attached to it after it is inserted into a needle, which is that the end of this thread is taken from the intestine and pulled gently, then a thin twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is inserted into the needle with the intestine's thread in it, and the intestine is stitched with it, then returned to the cavity.
And this type of stitching with ants and intestine is only by way of hope and expectation.
But if the rupture is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy for it and no healing from it at all.
