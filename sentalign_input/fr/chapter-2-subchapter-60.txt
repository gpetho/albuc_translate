of the stone
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones, and their extraction along with medicines; and I have explained the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stones one must operate with cutting; in the bladder, and in the penis; and I will explain it clearly and briefly.
I say that stones formed in the bladder occur more often in children, and it is a sign that the water jumps from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety; and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it often hangs, and then stiffens; and many of these stones pass through the urethra; and the treatment is easier for children until they are four years old, and it is very serious in the elderly, and moderate in the young, for those who are between youth and old age; and the treatment is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines. Because it sometimes obstructs the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and shake him and move him below, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes it jumps from the high place; then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards; then search for and touch the stone inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately hasten to cut over the stone. And if it does not fall completely to the touch, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a young adult; and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, then move it to the neck of the bladder; then press down with your finger, and push it to the place where you want to cut.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to stretch the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin that is under the testicles in the area where the cut is made; then insert the cutting spatula, which has this form:
And cut between what is between the testicles and the anus, not in the middle but on the side of the left buttock; and be straight over the stone, and your fingers should always be in the anus, and the cut should be transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps pressing it with the finger that is in the anus, so it comes out without effort; and know that there are some stones with angles and edges: they are difficult to extract; and there are some that are smooth, like an acorn, and round, whose exit is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the cut larger; and if it does not come out, then it is necessary to grasp it with forceps that are like a file at the tip, to hold the stone so it does not slip; or you insert underneath it a fine instrument curved at the tip; and if you cannot manipulate it this way, then enlarge the opening a bit, and if the blood flows, then stop it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, then first push the largest to the neck of the bladder, then cut over it, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterward if there are several. And if it is very large, then it must be sawed, and the wound made larger. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine always comes through where the place cannot heal; but always strive to pull it out, or to break it with forceps, until you extract it in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and compress it, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then wrap the patient on his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, then moisten the place well with oil and water, then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses form in the wound and corrosions, and clots of blood in the bladder, and the urine is retained because of this, which is known in such a way that blood flows with the urine: then insert your finger into the wound, and remove that blood, because if it remains, it corrodes the bladder, and rots it;
then wash the wound with water and hyssop and salt, and help it in all the ways you know, until it is healed; and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you tie his thighs together, and apply the medicines to the place.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and stuck inside, and the urine cannot flow out; then treat it with what I mentioned before, that you often cut it, and one is excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven this method.
Take an iron drill according to this shape and it should have three angles fixed in a stick:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder; then insert the drill into the penis gently, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side; then the urine will soon flow, then press your hand on what remains of the stone inside the penis. It will soon break, and come out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread below the stone and another above it, then cut the penis at the stone between the two ties, then remove it, and untie the thread, and clean the clotted blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
