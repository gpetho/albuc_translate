Chapter Twenty-Three:
On the Cauterization for Hoarseness of Voice and Constriction of the Windpipe.
When moisture accumulates in the windpipe, especially when it is due to a cold constitution, the patient should initially be treated with laxative medicines. Then cauterize the area near the root of the throat at the depressed location.
Take care not to let the cautery reach the throat or burn the tissue excessively, but only a little.
Then cauterize the area at the junction of the neck near the last vertebra.
The cautery should be nail-shaped as previously described.
Treat the area with the previously mentioned methods until it heals.
