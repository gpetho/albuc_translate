of the swelling of the feet
When the feet are swollen in someone who has dropsy, and are full of citrine-colored water, you must cauterize on the top of the foot between the little toe and the ring toe;
and lift your hand with the cautery without twisting.
And do not go in too deeply, thus the citrine water will come out, and the cautery should be according to this shape:
Afterwards, make two cauteries on the legs, one on each leg at the tip of the calf muscle;
and the cautery should be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without cleaning, so that the water comes out;
afterwards treat with the other treatments that we have mentioned.
