Chapter Thirty-One:
On the cauterization of dropsy.
Cauterization is not normally used for dropsy except in specific cases.
When treating dropsy using the methods described previously, if your treatment does not work, then you should cauterize with four cauterizations around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two between the vertebrae of the back, one on the right side of the chest, and one more on the stomach.
The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the tendon.
Then leave the cauterized area open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
Do not stop the patient's treatment after cauterization until it is clear that the two intended purposes are achieved, which will hasten their recovery.
The shape of the cautery used for the abdomen should be like a nail, as previously described, and the one used for the back should be like an olive, as described before.
