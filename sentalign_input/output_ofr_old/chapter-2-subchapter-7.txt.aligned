On the blockage of ears	On the treatment of obstructions in the ear.	0.6676754
Some children are born without any openings in their ears; and this same thing happens to men by blockage from a wound, or from flesh born inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear, so that it cannot be seen; and sometimes the opening is slightly closed, and it can be clearly seen.	Infants sometimes are born with an imperforated auditory meatus. Some people also get an obstruction in the passage of the ear, either from an injury or from flesh growing in it. Sometimes this obstruction is at the bottom of the ear out of sight, but sometimes it occurs a little outside the passage and is invisible.	0.8544009
The one that occurs deep inside, so that it cannot be seen, is difficult to heal in many cases, and in the one that can be seen, you should place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the apparent obstruction, open it with this spatula, of which this is the form:	The sort which occurs in the depths of the ear and is invisible is, in general, difficult to cure. As for that which is within sight, set the patient's ear in the sun and examine it; and if you see that the object is something external you should make an opening with a fine scalpel like this.	0.8310262
And it should be sharp and cutting at the front and back, completely smooth, so that it does not injure the ear; if the blockage is from flesh born in the ear canal, hold it with fine forceps, and cut it lightly, until all that flesh is removed.	Let its extremity be slightly broad, with a sharp point; while the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear. But if the obstruction be from flesh growing in the auditory meatus, catch it with a fine hook and cut it, with the utmost gentleness, till all the flesh is gone.	0.8075999
And if the blockage is deep in the ear, take a thin, light razor and heat it slightly in the fire, then place it in the ear canal.	If the obstruction be in the depth of the ear, take a fine smooth probe and warm it a little in the fire; then push it into the meatus.	0.8256224
If you feel the blockage which causes the patient difficulty hearing, pierce it lightly, and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear; then put a tent in the ear according to the width of the opening, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment.	If you feel the obstruction (what time the patient will experience hardness of hearing), seek to perforate it gently, being careful not to injure the nerve of the ear. Then put in a plug the width of the meatus, which you will have anointed with Egyptian ointment; do this for some days till you are sure that the wound is healing.	0.8122388
Do this every day until the wound is healed, or take a tent and soak it in rose water, and powder it with ground vitriol; and if you see the ear swollen, you should remove the tent and replace it with another tent soaked in cerate made with rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then treat it until it is healed.	Or take a plug and dip it into water and sprinkle it with powdered vitriol and use that. If you perceive the ear swelling with an abscess you should remove the plug and put in its place another previously prepared by soaking in wax made with oil of roses, till the abscess has subsided; then dress till it is healed.	0.80488396
And if bleeding occurs, soak a sponge and cloths in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the bleeding which are in the treatise on distillations.	If a haemorrhage occur, dip a sponge or piece of material in cold water and put it on the ear, and apply the rest of the treatment to stop haemorrhage mentioned in the treatise on instillations.	0.85322154
