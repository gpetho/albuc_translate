Chapter Forty-Eight.
On Cauterizing Numbness: When a limb becomes numb and is treated with medications, ointments, and bandages but does not heal, cauterize the numb limb itself with cauterizations according to what the size of the limb, large or small, requires.  And let your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals. Some numbness that occurs in the hand and foot may be cauterized in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, and the numbness will go away.
And no one should undertake this except one who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
