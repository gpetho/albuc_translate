 CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE.
On the cauterization of pustules occurring on the body.
Foul pustules sometimes arise on the body, caused by heavy corrupt frigid matter.
When they first appear you should cauterize the head of each one lightly with myrtle wood whose tip has been lighted in the fire; or with the root of the long birthwort; or with the lenticular cautery.
Sometimes furuncles also are cauterized in the same manner when they first arise; then they get no bigger and the superfluity originating them is dispersed and the patient is cured of them.
But before you cauterize these, the patient must be depleted by bleeding.
