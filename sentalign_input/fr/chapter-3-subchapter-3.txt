Know that sometimes both parts of the nose above are broken, or only one part, for these are two bones; and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, it only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must place your little finger in the nostril, and align the fracture inside with your index finger, and with your thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape;
and do this gently, and make sure the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and your finger cannot reach the place, then you must align it with the end of a somewhat thick stick.
And if the fracture is on both sides, do the same, and hasten to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess is soothed, then place tents of linen cloth at the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part.
Or place another on the other side, if the fracture is there; and the tents should be large enough to fill the nostrils.
And some restorers say the tents should be moistened with butter, and changed every day. This does not seem right to me, but they should be moistened with a mixture of egg white and flour dust; then leave the tent, until the bone is firm, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are placed in the nose instead of tents, and there is a soft cloth around, and the fracture holds, and the patient breathes through it; now do whichever you prefer.
And if a hot abscess occurs in the nose while you are working on it, apply wax or cotton moistened with rose oil, or a little of diaculum.
And if a hot abscess does not occur, apply a poultice externally, made of sesame flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then place light tow on it, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract them with suitable instruments, then sew the crack, and treat it with things that generate flesh and heal, such as poultices and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and place lead tubes, until it is healed.
