of a poorly healed wound
When the patient cannot bear cutting or opening, which we will discuss in its place, such an illness arises that can only be healed by cautery. 
When someone develops a fistula, and it is aged and emits pus and corrupted fluids, you should probe it fully with a thin tent, and make sure you know, using the whole tent, how deep it is.
Then heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula to the depth the tent entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, twice or thrice, according to the need; and be careful not to burn the nerves that are nearby, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and to the intestine, beware of these places, and do not do this except in fleshy areas, and be sure it is not perforated; afterwards treat the area until it is healed, and if the place is sealed, and the matter is removed over time, then know that the place is completely healed; and if the matter is not removed, know that the place is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted; and so as one of those which we will discuss in its place.
