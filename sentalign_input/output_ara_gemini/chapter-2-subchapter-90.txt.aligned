Chapter ninety on severing varicose veins.	CHAPTER NINETY. On cutting for varices.	0.7455107
Varicose veins are twisted, thick veins filled with black residues that occur in most parts of the body, and most commonly in the legs, especially in porters, donkey drivers, and laborers.	Varices are thick twisted veins filled with melancholic superfluities. They occur in most parts of the body, but generally in the legs, particularly in the legs of couriers and ploughmen and porters.	0.7827497
First, one should use strong shaking of the body from black bile several times, then bleed the basilic vein.	First you must purge the body free from black bile, several times, strongly. Then venesect the patient in the basilic vein.	0.87492776
As for its treatment with iron, it is of two types: one is to incise and extract the black blood, and the other is to extract the vein entirely.	The treatment with the knife is of two kinds: one is to incise and bring out all the black blood, the other is to draw out the vein and extract it bodily.	0.8836627
As for extracting it, it is done in this way: the patient's leg is shaved if it has a lot of hair, then he enters the bath and his leg is bathed with hot water until it reddens and the vein swells, or he exercises vigorously if he does not have a bath until the limb warms up.	Extraction is carried out in this way: the patient's leg is shaved if it is very hairy; then bring him to the bath and foment the leg in hot water until it becomes red and the veins are filled. Or if there be no bath available let him take violent exercise until the limb gets hot.	0.89284897
Then the skin opposite the vein is incised lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or below it near the heel, then the skin is opened with hooks and the vein is skinned from all sides until it is exposed to the touch, and when it appears, you see it bright red, and when it is free from the skin, you see it also like a tendon.	Then make a longitudinal incision in the skin over the vein, either at the upper end of it near the knee or at the lower end near the ankle. Then with hooks open up the skin and dissect away round the vein on each side until it is laid open to view. When it is visible you will see it red almost to the point of blackness; and when it is freed from the skin you will see it look like a cord.	0.903913
Then a probe is inserted under it until it rises and emerges from the skin, then it is hung with a smooth, blunt hook.	Then pass beneath it a probe to lift it up, and when it is clear of the skin hold it with a blunt smooth hook.	0.8222922
Then another incision is made near that incision about three fingers wide, then the skin is peeled off the vein until it appears. Then lift it with the probe as you did and hang it with another hook as you did before.	Then make another incision near by, three fingers distant; then dissect away the overlying skin until it comes to view; then raise it with a probe as before and lift it with a second hook as you did at first.	0.9008784
Then make another incision or many incisions if you need to.	Then make yet another incision or several if need be; then draw out the vessel at the lowest incision near the ankle and cut it through.	0.6959771
Then pull it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull it and extract it until it comes out of the second incision, then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until when all of it comes out, cut it.	Then pull it and draw it out until it emerges from the second incision. Then draw it towards the incision above that and so on until you draw it out of the third incision (or) the uppermost, until it is all extracted; then cut it off.	0.8595154
If it does not respond to pulling and extraction, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread and tie it and pull it, and insert the probe under it and twist it with your hand in every direction until it comes out, and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to extract it and it will cause harm to the patient.	But if it does not respond to your attempts to draw and extract it, pass in a needle with a strong double thread and ligate it and draw it up; and introduce a probe beneath it, and twist it all round until it comes out; but be careful lest it break; for if it break the total extraction of it will be very difficult for you and harm will thereby come to the patient.	0.8746451
When you have extracted all of it, put wool dipped in wine and rose oil or oil on the wounds and treat it until it heals.	When you have got it all out, apply to the incisions wool soaked in wine and oil of roses, or olive-oil, and dress it till it be healed.	0.91041315
If the varicose vein is convulsive, with curves and twists in different directions, and not straight as we have said, then it is necessary to incise it at each of its curves and twists, then hang it with hooks until you extract it entirely.	If the varix be contorted, with twists and turns from side to side and not in a straight line, as we said, then you should cut down along both sides of the twisted part and the places where it is tortuous, then catch it up with hooks and extract it whole.	0.8603476
Be careful when incising it not to cut or injure the vein, for it will make it difficult for you to extract it, so be very careful.	Be careful in incising over it that you do not cut into or injure the vein, for this will render the extraction difficult; therefore be most careful.	0.94260174
It should not have a curvature like other hooks. And it should not be sharp at the tip so that it does not injure the vein/vessel.	It is not bent like other hooks, and its extremity must be blunt so as to not injure the vein.	0.82707316
And it should be thick at the bend, smooth, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein/vessel with its thinness. Rather, it should have extra thickness, as we have said.	It should be of a broad curve and smooth, for if it is fine-pointed its fineness may cut the vein; rather it should be quite thick, as we said.	0.7927325
