Chapter twenty-six on suturing the nose, lip, and ear if their connection is severed by a wound or something similar	CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX. On suture of nose, lip, and ear, when there is discontinuity from a wound or the like.	0.83043694
Know that whenever a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment rarely succeeds except in some people.	You should know that when discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, treatment of them rarely does any good, except in a few people.	0.8971449
So it is necessary, when something like this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with its blood, to bring the edges of the wound together by stitching, then treat it until it heals.	When such a thing happens to anyone, look carefully, and if the wound be fresh and bleeding, bring the edges of the wound together with a suture, and dress them till they are healed.	0.752607
And if the separation of the connection has separated its lips and each side has become sound, it is necessary to excoriate each side with the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds, then bring the two lips together by stitching and tighten them, and sprinkle on it ground costus and frankincense, and put over the powder a plaster of date palm ointment or other vulnerary ointments, and leave it tight for two or three days, then loosen it and change the medication, and leave it until the stitches fall out on their own, then treat it with the ointment until it heals.	If the discontinuity has separated the edges, and both edges have healed, it is necessary to scrape both edges on the external skin till they bleed; then bring the edges together with a suture and dust over it dragon's blood and olibanum; and put over the powder a plaster of Palm ointment or some other of the regenerative ointments, and leave bandaged for two or three days; then unbandage and change the medicine, and let the sutures come away of themselves; and afterward dress with ointment till healed.	0.8527704
The method of stitching is to bring together the separation of the connection either with needles as we described in stitching the abdomen, or with thread as I explained to you there.	Now the manner of suturing is to close the discontinuity, either with a needle, as we describe for suture of the belly, or with a thread as we tell you there.	0.8356123
