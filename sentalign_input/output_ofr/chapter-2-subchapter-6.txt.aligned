On the blockage of the ears	On the treatment of things that fall into the ear.	0.47464988
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an insect, or mineral stone or similar things like iron; or seeds, such as oats, beans, peas; or flowing things like water and vinegar and similar things.	All that falls into the ear comes under four categories: mineral stone, or what resembles stone, such as iron or glass; vegetable grain such as pea or date-stone or the like; or liquid such as water or vinegar; or animal.	0.8906022
When a stone or other kind of thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear, nor grow in the ear, put the ear in the sun.	When a stone or something of that sort that does not grow gets into the ear, turn the ear toward the sun.	0.87575686
If you see the stone, then instill a little violet oil or sesame oil, then use extraction; and make him sneeze with condiments, and block his nostrils when the sneeze comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and stretch the ear upwards.	If you see the stone, pour upon it a little oil of violets or sesame; then try to get it out by moving the head or by inducing sneezing with ptarmica and keeping the nose closed at the onset of sneezing, having first made round the ear a circle of pieces of cloth or wool and drawn the ear upwards.	0.845191
Often it comes out by this treatment; and if it does not come out, then use extraction with fine tweezers, of which this is the form:	This treatment will usually bring it out. But if it does not come out, try to get it out with a fine pair of tweezers shaped thus.	0.7709198
If it comes out with the tweezers, that is good; if not, then use extraction with a fine hook with a small bend; and if it does not come out by this, then make a tube of brass and push the end of the tube into the opening of the ear firmly, and block what is around the tube with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the tube; then pull it out strongly, for often it comes out as we have said; and if it does not come out in this way, then take birdlime, and put some on the tip of an instrument that is suitable for this purpose, and put a little cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it is, and pull it out. And if it does not come out by all these things that we have said, then hasten to cut the ear before a hot abscess comes, and spasm; and the manner of the cutting is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to his strength, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision in the base of the ear at the fat or the adjacent area; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and suck it quickly with your mouth; and treat it until he is healed. And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, then administer extraction; and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin spatula according to this form:	And if this does not bring it out, make a bronze tube and introduce the end of the tube well into the meatus of the ear and fill in round with wax softened with oil so that there may be no outlet save through the tube; then suck it out with all your breath; it will often come out with this. But if it does not come out with these means we have described, take turpentine resin or bird-lime, a very little; twist some compact cotton wool on the end of a probe and put this on the tip; then introduce it gently into the ear after you have dried out all the moisture from the ear. But if your treatment so far is unavailing, then be quick and incise before an abscess or spasm supervene. Now this is the way to incise: first, the patient's cephalic vein should be cut and blood drawn, in proportion to his strength; then seat the patient in front of you and turn his ear upwards; make a small incision at the lobule of the ear in the depression there (the incision should be crescent-shaped) until you reach the stone; then extract it with whatever instrument you may.	0.9245535
But do not do this when you think that the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it; then extract it with fine tweezers and by sucking, as we have said, so that the extraction is complete.	You should not do this except when you are sure that this grain has become moist by reason of the vapours of the ear, so that you may cut up the grain into several small pieces. Then you may extract them with a blunt hook or fine-headed tweezers, or by suction, as we have mentioned; for their extraction will be easy.	0.7644201
In the case of water that falls into the ear, the patient should use sneezing powders first, and plug the ear with old cotton.	As for water getting into the ear, the patient should first employ sneezing excited by ptarmica, his ear having been plugged with a piece of teased-out cotton; he should lie upon that ear in which the water is; and if it so come out, well and good.	0.6287453
And lie on the same ear where the water is.	But if not, take a number of small stones about a finger's length, thin and smooth, and warm them a little in the fire; and have the patient put one of them into the meatus of the ear and let him hop on that one foot on that side; and, with another stone, tap upon the one put into the ear; he should keep this up with stone after stone till all the water has come out.	0.45253903
In the extraction of the creature, if it is small-bodied, like a flea or similar thing, treat it as we have said in the section; but if it is large-bodied so that it can be felt, then use forceps for extraction; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.	As for the extraction of a creature getting into the ear, look to see if it is small of body, such as a flea or the like, in which case treat by those means mentioned in the section. But if it has a large body, conspicuous to the touch, try to get it out with tweezers and hooks; for of all things that stick in the ear this is the easiest to extract.	0.88621885
In the extraction of worms generated in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the section and in the treatise on distillations, and the treatment is not effective, you must look at the ear in the sunlight: if you see any worms, pull them out with fine forceps, and if they are not visible, take the cannula, of which this is the form:	As for the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you have unavailingly treated it by those methods mentioned in the section in the treatise on instillations, you will need to examine the ear in the sunlight; and if you can see any worms, extract with tweezers or fine hooks.	0.8234918
And it should be narrow below and wide above. And put the narrowest end in the ear according to the degree of the patient's suffering, then suck strongly with the cannula; do this often until all the worms come out.	But if you cannot see any, then take a cannula of this form narrow in its lower part, broad above; and introduce the narrow part into the ear as far as the patient can bear it; then make strong suction through it, repeatedly, till all the worms are extracted.	0.7316451
And if they do not come out, pack cotton around the cannula as I have described for stones; and if they still do not jump out as we have said, administer distillations that the ancients have proven effective in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations; and distill your oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which this is the form, as you see:	But if they do not come out in response to your treatment, plug all round the cannula with wax as bidden in treating for a stone. If nothing will bring them out, employ the instillations which I mentioned as having been tried by the Ancients for killing worms; you will find that in the treatise on instillations.	0.830696
