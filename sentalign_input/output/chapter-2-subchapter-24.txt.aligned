About the flesh on the nose	On the treatment of nasal polyp.	0.44223338
Sometimes diverse types of flesh grow on the nose, some resembling scorpions with many legs; and some with flesh that is encrusted in a dark color, and some with soft flesh of good color. In those cases of flesh that are soft and not encrusted, you must make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and throw the hook at that flesh, and pull it out; then cut what you can sustain with a delicate sharp spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.	Sometimes there arise in the nose various superfluous fleshy growths. One of these is a thing resembling a centipede; another, a cancerous growth, stony, hard, and pale in colour; another again is a soft growth, not pale. Any of these growths that is soft is not malignant or cancerous. You should make the patient sit before you, facing the sun, and dilate his nose and introduce a hook into these polyps and draw them out; then amputate what you can take hold of, with a fine scalpel sharp on one side, till you know that all the growth is gone.	0.82826793
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, then open it with a delicate instrument lightly, so that nothing remains; and if blood overflows, or a hot abscess appears, treat it as necessary; and if it is a malignant abscess, quickly cauterize it until the blood is staunched and all the flesh is removed, then throw vinegar and water or wine into the nose.	And if there be anything of them left behind that you cannot cut away, then gently scrape away with any fine instrument till nothing of them remains; and if the bleeding be too much for you, or an abscess occur, then combat it by suitable means. If it be a malignant swelling, then speedily cauterize till the bleeding stops and all the polypi are gone. Then introduce into the nose, after the incision, vinegar and water, or wine; and if the nose be free and fluid flow into the throat from it, then know that he is cured.	0.91252923
And let it be made of silver or brass, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the same conduits; and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be used for purging the head; and have a handle on the head for holding it when heating the oil or any liquid.	It should be made of silver or bronze like a small lamp, its oil-container open, and with its channel likewise. If you like you may make its spout closed like a reed; and the oil-container of the instrument can be made covered over. It has a handle at the end, as you see, to hold it when heating the oil or whatever juice or other liquid you wish.	0.8737789
