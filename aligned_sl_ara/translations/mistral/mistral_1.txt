This book is completed for you, O sons, who are studying this science of medicine in its entirety. I have reached the goal in it, made clear and explained its details. I find it fitting to complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the practical application of the hand.
The practice of surgery in our land and time is almost forgotten, except that it should be studied and its effect felt. The only remains of it are simple drawings in the old books, their meanings and benefits obscured by errors and distortions until they have lost significance and utility.
I intend to revive and enrich it with this treatise through explanation, clarification, conciseness, and providing illustrations of the various tools used in surgery as an addition to the information and as a necessity for those who require it.
The reason there is no skilled craftsman in our time is because the art of medicine requires long study, and it is necessary for the practitioner to acquire a thorough knowledge of anatomy as described by Galenus before that. Until he becomes familiar with the functions, parts, and connections of all organs, their openings and closures, the bones, joints, muscles, their number and locations, their vessels and nerves, and the positions of their openings.
"Therefore, Abul Qasim says that physicians are many in name, but few in deed, and especially so in the craft of surgery. We have previously mentioned this aspect within the introduction of this book.
"For he who is not well-versed in the matters we have discussed about surgery, will not likely avoid making a fatal mistake as you have seen many do in this science who practice it with ignorance and negligence.
"That is why I saw an ignorant physician slice open a camel's hump on a woman's neck, intending to treat some of her ailments with incisions at the neck. However, he cut through a major vein, causing her to bleed profusely until she died between his hands.
"I also saw another physician who attempted to extract a stone from a man's bladder, as the stone was large and decayed. He broke it into pieces using a piece of glass. "The man died within three days, and I was called to extract the stone again. Upon examination, I found the fragment of the bone from the stone and the surrounding tissue, which showed that he could not have done it.
"I also saw another physician who earned his living by practicing medicine among the rulers of our land.
Al-Tibbi (the physician) hastened towards Suqas Ibn Mukarram, as he had a fracture near the elbow with an injury. He quickly set the fracture onto the wound in a strong and precise manner without leaving space for air to enter.
Then he released it (the fractured bone) from its fixation, then left him for some days and ordered him not to move his arm until it swelled, brought it out and cured the ulcer.
He called him (the patient) and hastened to remove the fixation, so he regained his comfort and became independent from his pain, except that corruption had already dominated the limb and I was unable to amputate it.
The corruption continued to strive in the limb until it perished.
I saw another physician with a protruding and swollen tumor, so he waited for days until the bone of its owner became soft, as it was a sarcoma (cancer) that should not be exposed to iron tools.
except it is in a limb that may require amputation entirely.
Therefore, my sons, it is important for you to know that work with hands has two types: a type of work that accompanies safety and another type of work that comes with pain in most cases.
"Be cautious in every place where this work requires fear and hesitation, you should avoid and reject it.
"Lest the ignorant find a way to speak and slander, take precautions for yourselves with armor and clothing, and treat your patients with kindness and firmness.
"Employ the best route that leads to safety and a praiseworthy outcome, and diagnose dangerous and difficult diseases.
"Be aware of yourselves against what you fear may mislead you in your religion and worldly life, for it will remain with the ignorant and raise you in this world and the hereafter to the extent of your abilities.
"Galenus said in some of his maxims: Do not treat a bad disease to be called good doctors.

The First Chapter.
On Veins.
Before we describe the work with it, it is necessary to mention its benefits, disadvantages, and in what temperament it is used.
I say that the discussion about the benefits and disadvantages of veins is a long, precise, secret knowledge that many sages have spoken about it.
They have differed in it and I have abbreviated their speech out of fear of prolongation.
I say that veins are beneficial in general for all ill temperaments, whether they are without matter or with matter, and these are the hot temperament without matter and the cold temperament without matter.
As for the cold temperament with matter, they have differed in it. Some said that veins are beneficial for it, while others disagreed and said that veins do not help in a disease of heat and cold because the nature of fire is hot and cold.
It is a possibility that it can be cured from hot and cold disease with a warm or cool vein, and the one who says otherwise states that veins in fire may help from a hot and cold disease in humans. Whenever you place your hand in a human body and moisten it to the state of fire, you will freeze the human body with cold.
And I say, by his words, for experiment has revealed this to me more than once, except that it is not fitting but for one who has trained and practiced in the art of incision with a sharp scalpel. And there is variation in the temperaments of people and states of illness within themselves, their causes and symptoms, and duration of time.
As for other diseases, there is no fear of them for you, and especially not for cold or wet diseases; for all physicians agree on this, and do not differ in the benefit of incision in them.
And know, O sons, that the secret of treating with fire and its superiority over medicine is because fire, in isolation, does not harm the part it touches or affect another connected part except for a gentle injury.
The medicine with fire may reach beyond the parts and perhaps create diseases that complicate the organ's pathways and even kill; but because of its nobility and dignity, fire does not do this except by excessive use.
It has become clear to us through experience that this is for the duration of service and care in craftsmanship, and standing on the truth of matters.
In this book, I have refrained from lengthy discourse, yet if it were not contrary to my book, I would have given you in the fire a secret deeply hidden and its method of performing it on bodies for expelling diseases through a philosophical explanation that clearly demonstrates understanding.
Know, O sons, that they have differed regarding the time which heals the eye and considered spring as the best time.
I say, the eye can heal in every time because the damage that occurred before the time will take a while to benefit from the eye. It is certainly the case that if the eye injuries are serious and irreversible, it cannot afford delay due to fear of aggravation; for internal damage caused before time may be greater than the external harm after time.
It does not occur to you, O sons, that the common people and the ignorance of physicians think that an eye which relieves from a disease should not return again and they make it forbidden.
The substance you refer to is not just a medicine that alters the temperament, but it also dries up the humors which are the cause of diseases.
The substance you refer to excels over the medicine in speed of effectiveness, strength of action, and severity of rule.
The disease may return at certain times depending on the nature of the causative factor, and it may be strengthened and worsened in the body by the gathering of substances within it and the body's preoccupation with acquiring them from food and similar causes.
May Allah not cause the disease that this substance is used for to be a severe or complex one, in a part of the body with a lot of substances and humors. Like the toothache, its cause can be prevented from returning and it may be less severe.
And as for the common opinion that this substance is the last resort in medicine, it is correct to some extent because they believe that there is no remedy that can be helpful with a medicine or without one after the occurrence of the disease and the use of this substance and the act of applying it differs from that.
The meaning of "this substance is the last resort in medicine" is that we use various remedies for a disease and they do not work, then we use this substance which succeeds; from here it becomes clear that this substance is the last resort in medicine. On the meaning that has become popular, and many doctors are ignorant about it.
The early people have mentioned that gold (al-kayy) is better than iron, and they said this because of the refinement and nobility of gold; however, it does not cause corrosion (mudqiqah), and this is not a general rule (ala 'l-italaq).
Because I have found that it is true only in some abdomens, not all; gold (al-kayy) is better and superior to iron as they said, except if you want to protect the container in fire, then the redness of the gold will not indicate for you the degree of heat you desire.
Because it heats up quickly and if you increase its heat in the fire, it melts quickly; thus, the maker from this is prone to error. That is why gold (al-kayy) with us is slower and further away from being suitable for work, if God wills it.
This chapter (Baab) is organized in the Kunya (gold) from head to foot, so that it facilitates what the student wants from it, if God wills it.
The first section.
In the head-Kunya, there is one Kunya.
This instrument is beneficial for the pressure and swelling on both skulls, which are causes of headache, frequent fallings from the head to the sides of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep and toothaches and abscesses of the shaving (area). For every disease that is due to swelling, such as pain in the testicles (falaj), headache, sciatica and similar diseases.
This image instructs the physician firstly to use a simple and easy-to-apply medication for the head for three or four nights according to the strength, habit, and custom of the patient.
Then, he commands him to shave his head with the razor, then he sits him between your hands with his hands placed on his chest.
Then, you place the tip of your thumb between his nostrils until the middle finger is reached, teaching this position by guidance.
Then, he squeezes the lemon-oil bottle which is shown in this image.
Expose from the bone the size of the nut or the size of a chestnut, then lift your hand and with it take the same iron or another one if it is rusty. Until you see what I have told you in the bone, then take something from salt and dissolve it in water, drink a little of it and place it at the mentioned position and leave it for three days.
Then, apply a linen bandage soaked in oil and leave it until the dryness disappears from the fire, then treat it with four-fingered frankincense until it heals, if God wills.
It is said that when a wound remains open, it attracts pus which is better and more beneficial.
Some of them mentioned that the skin should be sewn to the bone, and the sutures should be held until some of the marrow of the bone burns, then it is scraped away what has burned from the bone afterwards, and then treated.
Others said it is necessary to make the incision deep until it affects the bone strongly, so that a piece of bone falls off like scalp or small flakes, and they claimed that this leaves an opening in the skull and keeps the wound open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals, and I do not see any of these two types (of treatments) except in some people and on the path of recklessness and leaving it with me is better and safer because the skull contracts when its natural connection is severed as we have seen in other parts.
And it is not correct when the skull of an infant is weak by nature and the first type (of treatments) agrees with me, I prefer it and its use is recommended if God wills.
Chapter Two.
On the subject of the head also.
If a tumor occurs in the head, prolonged and it is not relieved by incision, lancing, cautery or caustic, or pressure bandage or leeches, and if one keyhole has been made but it did not relieve, then look into it again. If the head of the tumor is strong in structure and not weak, and it has a severe cold sensation, then make another keyhole slightly above it. Then make a keyhole on each side of the head until the pus is drained and the tumor is exposed from the bone that we have described. Make a keyhole in the posterior part of the head where it is known as the nape, and press gently in this place without breaking the bone, for the tumor will have severe pain contrasting with the pain of other keyholes on the head, and I shall specify this keyhole in its location.
The keyhole that is made in the side of the head and at its posterior part should be shallower than the one that is made in the middle of the head, as illustrated here.
Chapter Three.
In case of a fracture that is not displaced.
If a fracture of the skull occurs with swelling and it extends to the eye, empty the pus with appropriate medications for the head as described in the section on diseases, if this does not help, then treat it with trepanation from two sides. Either by burning medication or by iron (tool).
As for trepanation with burning medication, it is to take a clove of garlic, sharpen its sides from both ends, then drill the location of the wound with a wide needle until it reaches a space beneath the skin that can hold the garlic clove.
Then it is to insert it under the skin until it disappears, then tighten a ligature firmly around it for about ten hours, then dissolve (the ligature) and remove the garlic clove and leave the wound for two or three days before dressing it.
Cover it with an ointment made of oil until the area heals, then treat it with a hot poultice made of mustard until it is cured (by God's will), or you can do this with some burning medications mentioned in the 14th chapter on burning medications.
Regarding the cauterization with iron, it should be as follows: The bowl (should be) like this shape: [Picture/Image].
The iron bowl is named because its head resembles a bolt, having some knob at the center of it.
Then, place it (the iron) on the wound location and hold your hand, while slightly moving the iron piece here and there. The burning capacity should be similar to half of its length. Lift your hand (slightly) so as not to burn the surrounding flesh, which is below it, and then drink a poultice made of linen soaked in brine water and place it on the wound site for three days. Then, apply oil to the poultice and treat it with alum until it heals, if God wills.
If you wish, use a narrow knife-like notch from the bowl to make cuts in it for avoiding cutting of the surrounding flesh specifically.
Chapter Four.
Treating incisions.
If treatment of the incision is made as described in our previous discussion and no improvement is observed, check if the treatment mentioned in the list of diseases does not apply to it, or if one of the methods described earlier such as burning or application of medicine has not been performed. The mortar (makwaat al-sakeeniyya) should be cauterized until it turns white, after learning its position by a line of the length of half a finger or similar, and leaving your hand once, then pressing it until the veins are cut and approaching the bone.
You should be careful not to burn the connection between the jawbone and the moving muscle that it contains, causing inflammation.
Be aware and cautious of bleeding veins when you have cut them, as there is danger in the cut. Avoid, without doubt, anyone who does not know what he is doing and has no experience in the matter, leaving work to them.
Here is the method for treating bleeding veins on a face, if God wills: If you see a suitable method that this procedure does not achieve, do not use it.
You see a possible patient with an injury in the middle of the head, as we described previously, and treat the wound until it heals, if God wills.
If you wish to use the method we described in the chapter on cauterizing veins, it is better and more effective than this one.
Fifth Chapter.
Wounds of the Ears.
If a wound occurs in the ear due to cold and is relieved by easy treatment, and other treatment mentioned in the division has not helped, and the wound does not heal, then cauterize the hole that is called "the point," which is its image.
Then, it is cauterized around the entire ear or both ears in a circular motion if the wound is in them. Afterward, the distance should be increased slightly from the root of the ear after the location has been determined by measurement, and the distance should be about ten points in each ear or around it. Then, the locations are treated until it heals if God wills.
Sixth Chapter.
Fractures.
The fracture that is treated by the knife should only be of the type that occurs from a blow as described in the division of diseases.
A knife should avoid the type that occurs from dislocation and numbness of the nerves.
When this type of fracture is treated by the saws, files, and chisels and it does not heal, then the cause should be cauterized with three knives. One should be near the root of the ear, the second slightly below its base, and the third at the meeting point of the eyes.
Make an incision opposite the affected side as strangulation only occurs on the visible side.
The image of the incision should be made by making an incision opposite the upper ear, slightly below the occiput (back of the head), and on the other side in the neck, with a length equal to the width of the thumb.
Descend with your hand until you burn half the thickness of the skin, and this is the image of the cup or one type of cautery, which was presented only to be a little less rough as you can see. The cautery should have a slight sliver of gold, then treat the place as previously described until it heals, if God wills.
Section Seven.
Incision for a stopped-up nose.
If a nose is stopped-up and treated as previously described but does not improve and there is no cause for suspicion, make four incisions. Make an incision on each side of the head, one in the middle of the head as previously described and one in the nape of the neck at the appropriate place.
The description of the cups, and it may also be made an incision on the mouth of the nose to be deep, then treat accordingly.
Chapter Eight.
On the topic of amputation.
In cases of tumors, it is preferable to administer a strong laxative beforehand to cleanse the intestines and the brain.
Then, he should shave his head completely and on the second day, apply the plaster made of kohl as described in the article on fractures, several times, because it is a strong painkiller.
And perform the procedure on the indicated location, because if he has a seizure while doing so or if he does not, it will be necessary to insert three plasters from top of the head to the neck.
Place a finger between each plaster, then treat the tumor as described, if he wishes to increase the number of plasters and the patient is likely to tolerate it, apply the central one.
If he wishes to increase, apply the plasters on both sides and treat him until he recovers, and the plasters should be oily as shown in the image that follows.
Chapter Nine.
On the topic of the scrotum and swelling of the entire body.
It is necessary to first clean the head with laxatives as previously mentioned, then shave the patient's head and apply a plaster in the center of the head and one on each side of the head and another on his neck.
Three on the neck veins, if it (the disease) necessitates stretching the body more than that and the patient is likely to have it, and the disease is strong and decisive, then four ligatures on his chest veins. Reach with the cauterizing iron until it burns more of the skin and then lift your hand, then treat it as described until he recovers, God willing, and the cautery be zitouniya (olive-oil based).
The Tenth Chapter.
Incision of the Gland.
The incision that is performed on the gland, which precedes the abscess, should first be cleaned with large syringes and all the treatment mentioned in the section if the cause is severe and it is likely to take medication.
If it is a child who does not tolerate medication, do not use the cautery or the ligature for cleansing the head before that for several days with improving his diet.
Then shave his head, then make one incision in the middle of the head as described, and another incision at a later time. On each side of his head, if the patient is strong and it is likely that he will tolerate it, make the incisions as described on the abscess and stretch the body on the neck and chest veins, and the cautery be zitouniya (olive-oil based) as described.
If the patient is a child, make the incision gentle on this form.
The First Chapter [is about] Making an Incision Gently on this Form if the Patient is a Child.
On Operating Anuswerts (Patients with Rectal Prolapse).
If the cause of anuswerts (Rectal Prolapse) is excessive and hardened exudates, then use the vessels which we have mentioned in the owner of the penis [male genitalia].
If the cause of anuswerts (Rectal Prolapse) is discharge moving towards blackness, and the patient's body is soft, clean his head with what purifies it as it comes in the division [operation].
Then cut off the patient's head, then make a firm ball from cattail like a circle, and lower it into his center [anus]. The patient remains sitting upright, holding on to all sides, then take one hot coal from the fire of camel dung.
Then heat it moderately in the fire until it is as hot as a finger can bear, then empty it and insert it into the circle [anus] at its center. Leave it there until it cools down. Perform this procedure on the patient every week with his good treatment until he recovers, if Allah wills it.
If you want to cauterize it with many small points without holding the incision, let there be a smoky vapor. This type of cauterization makes the head [of the patient] sweat moderately.
Then lay a cotton on it (the wound) soaked in oil or raw chicken fat.
The second chapter is titled "The Second Chapter".
In case of water discharge in the eye.
If it becomes clear to you that there is water discharge in the eye with the signs mentioned in the section, then, clean the affected person's head and hair thoroughly from all moisture and wash his face in hot water in the bath house for a few days.
Then shave his head and clip the hair in the middle of the forehead, then clip two more on both temples if there is water discharge from both eyes or from one eye only.
Then cut with scissors all the hairs and veins that are under the skin so that the cotton swabs can be long enough to reach the temples and avoid bleeding.
If you see any swelling or inflammation, cut it at the spot with whatever treatment is available to you, and wisdom in healing the veins and cutting them off will be sought, along with avoiding bleeding.
There are two cotton swabs under the eyebrows.
The third chapter is titled "The Third Chapter".
In case of constant tearing (of the eyes).
If the eyelids are constantly stuck together and they were previously burns or scalds that are on the surface of the head from outside the head, and you think it is a thick cold ulcer with a bad odor, apply the remedy you have described at the beginning of hot water. A lesion in the middle of the forehead, two lesions on the eyebrows and two lesions under the eyes just below the bones. If it requires more, apply a lesion on each side of the eye on the eyelid with a small cup.
Fourth Section.
In the nose cavity.
If treated with what was mentioned in the section and the treatment does not work, force the suspect to swallow three hot peppers then shave his head and apply the central lesion with a cup of olive oil. Then apply with a flat iron (or metal cup) two times on the eyebrows, slightly under the hair and preserve the scalds, do not cut them, this is an image of the flat iron.
Fifth Ten Section.
In the protrusion of the eyelid.
If the eyelid protrudes due to a disease or swelling, apply a lesion with this crescent-shaped cup.
If you wish, make two incisions slightly above the eyelids on each side, and keep them away from the edges of the eyelashes, and let each incision be as long as the eyelid.
Do not stretch the skin too much, but only to the extent that a third of it is burned, and the appearance of the cup should be like this.
The Sixteenth Chapter.
In an Eye Cup.
If you turn them inside, the eye will be pushed out and the cup will be in it in two types. Either the cup is burned or the cup is with burning medicine, if it is burned then order the patient to leave the incision before that until it grows and becomes flat.
If it (the incision) is made near the plant, it (the wound) will shrink to avoid movement until it grows back. When it grows back and stops, place the head of the leech on your stone (pestle). Then learn (from it) on the eyelid with the cautery, as a mark in the form of a leaf.
The marking begins by drawing close to the incision, then a moist cotton is placed under the eyelid either in white or blue ink. After that, the image of this cup is imprinted on it.
Then gradually, the image is imprinted little by little in many repetitions until it burns the surface of the skin, which is shaped like a leaf of an aspen tree clearly and leaves a mark indicating the success of your work that you see the eyelid becoming swollen and the hair rising above the meat of the eye.
Lift your hand when that happens and leave it for three days, then apply cotton soaked in oil until the scab falls off, then treat it with mercury until it heals if Allah wills. If anything of the hair returns after a time and the eyelid swells again.
Prepare the eye again in that place as you did first, if there is hair in the lower eyelid, pull it out until it returns to its natural position and does not cause any hair loss from the eye. As for the cautery with medicine, it means ordering the leech to leave the incision until it grows and heals.
Then, make a figure of parchment resembling an ass, then take from the well-boiled soap and unslaked lime from each, weighing a dirham or similar, crush them altogether into a good paste and perform this with a pestle so that it does not harden. Then, spread it over the parchment that you have made resembling an ass's figure and place it on one or two eyes, then put a cotton soaked in white of egg and garlic beneath the eye.
Place your thumb on the medicine and press it gently, and move it whenever you feel the garlic, so that the medicine finds its way like fire, until the garlic no longer perspires, then leave the medicine and move it with your thumb, if the garlic subsides, remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Observe, if you see the eye has swelled up as it does during burning or cutting, otherwise repeat the treatment in the place where the medicine had no effect and did not darken until your work is complete and the eye is healed, then put cotton soaked in oil on top of it to extinguish the burn.
Then treat it with the Nux-vomica (naghleh) or similar until it opens, and you should strive to preserve while working that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye. If the lid is adhered after days and there is hair in the eye, something should be removed from the eye.
Prepare the medicine specifically for this situation where the lid has adhered, as you did first, then treat it until it opens. This is a page of the horse's hide.
Know that human eyes can vary in smallness and largeness, so adjust your treatment accordingly. It is not hidden that there is a remedy for those who have this condition with this craft.
The Seventh Chapter.
Treatment for the nasal ulcer that appears in the corner of the eye.
If the nasal ulcer is treated with what we have mentioned in the articles on diseases and it did not heal, then you should try this feature.
The guilty person is ordered to place his head in your stone and a servant will hold his head between your hands so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then place a cotton swab dipped in egg white or in the ointment of the Persian roses on his eyes, then cover the container which is shown here.
Make it tubular, like the beak of an eagle, from one side which contains the cavity, and if you wish, from the other side. If you wish, it may be closed like a bladder, except that this form is best for your work, God willing.
Then, grind the nose if it is open and extract its contents and blow air through it or if it is not open, then open it and extract pus. Afterwards, place a cupping glass over it as it is very protective. Hold onto it until you reach the bone.
Move your hand slightly away from the cavity towards the nose tip to avoid mistakes or harming the eye, so that the cupping glass falls into the corner of the eye and corrupts it. If you reach the bone with the first incision, do not repeat the process unless necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a poultice with oil and treat it with warm oil until it heals. If it does not heal within 40 days, apply the sharp purgative medicine to reveal the bone and move it as will be described in its relevant chapter, God willing.
The last part of one of the Nasurs is mentioned at the beginning by some, he heads towards the Nasur (the nose) and breaks it then puts fine gravel inside its fracture (the broken nose).
Pour in it a measure of lead filings (lead shot) weighing dirhams, grasp the forceps firmly and tightly wrapped with a tampon soaked in white or water. The patient's eye should not move lest the corrosive lead is directed into his eye. It is necessary to place a cotton swab over the patient's eye.
If the lead burns the nasal passage and causes a strange stench, then it is necessary to use the incision in the nose (nasotomy) and redirect the nose into the nasal passages as appropriate for its condition.
The Twelfth Chapter.
On Fractures of the Eye.
Fractures of the Eye occur frequently, especially in children's eyes, and it is common for them to happen. If this fracture is treated as described in the classification section, treatment may not be successful. In such a case, a small cylindrical socket made of bone (a bone cavity) should be made on this shape.
The cavity should be on the handle of the scalpel, then place it in a pincer with a screw, inside the crack, until the knife reaches the depth of the crack, then treat it with cautery until it bleeds, if God wills.
The ninth section.
In the case of a nasal bone fracture in the mouth.
If it appears in the nose, or the nasal passage, or at the base of the nasal bones and a fracture occurs and bursts, causing drainage of blood from the nose, and treatment is applied but does not heal, then a cup should be placed over the fractured area to prevent infection.
Then, a pincer is inserted into the nasal fracture and the hand is held until the iron band covering it reaches the edge and end of the fracture, then this should be done once or twice, after which it is treated as previously described until it bleeds, if God wills.
If the tissue is cut and bleeds, there is no need for further examination. However, if it does not bleed, then examination of the site is necessary and the decaying bone should be removed as much as possible, if God wills.
The one hundredth section.
In the case of a deviated nasal passage or deformed nasal bone.
If the tooth abscess occurs due to moisture and the roots move, and you treat it with medicines but it doesn't improve, place a small stone on your palm then extract the cavity after that, placing the tube on the root.
Insert a tube, which is held with pliers, into the cavity and keep your hand slightly until the tooth feels hot as it reaches the root of the tooth, then raise your hand. Repeat this process as desired, then the tooth will fill with salt water.
Hold it for an hour and shoot at it, so the moving tooth will become fixed and the abscess tooth will harden and the corrupt moisture will dry up.
Chapter one, forty.
In case of toothache.
If the toothache is due to cold or there is swelling and treatment with medicines does not improve, then fumigate it using either hot oil or fire.
As for fumigation with oil, take beef tallow and heat it in an iron pot or a container, then take a small cloth and wring it on the edge of the container, dip it in the heated tallow and place it on the painful tooth using pliers and hold it until it cools.
Then, repeatedly heat it until the strength of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. If you wish to apply a swab or lint dipped in cold oil, place it on the affected tooth and cover it with the protected iron [instrument] until the fire reaches the tooth socket.
To use fire, it is to take a brass or iron pipe and fill it with some charcoal so that the heat of the fire does not reach the affected mouth, then heat the vessel whose shape resembles the tooth and place it on the same tooth and hold your hand until the vessel cools, do this several times.
The pain goes away either in the same day or on a later day, and it is advisable when using this method to fill the affected mouth with good oil and hold it for an hour then squeeze it, this is the shape of the vessel.
Tie it with any side you wish and to the thread that can be, this is the shape of the pipe.
The second chapter and the tenth.
In the operation of dogs.
If the dog is suffering from worms and cold dampness, and it has not reacted to drugs and you wish to perform a quick operation, then heat the hollow vessel whose shape resembles an outlet on both sides.
The excerpt should read: "The gas escapes from the cavity of the other side and it is placed as a pouch on the same worm again, if necessary, until reaching the depth of the worm. If the worm is small, make the tube according to the size of the worm.
Leave it for three days, then wrap it in cotton soaked in oil until what has been burned goes away, then treat it with balm and ointment until it heals, if Allah wills.
The third and fortieth chapter.
In the cavity of hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If moisture prevails on the skull of the head, and it is not possible to remove the obstacle with easy medications, then it should be drained first with easy medicines, then a tube should be made in the incision of the neck at the base of the occiput.
Be careful not to reach the occiput with the cavity, and do not burn the skin more than half, then make another tube at the neck junction in a loose piece of skin that is broad and the tube should be spiral on the advancing side.
Treat it with what has been mentioned until it heals, if Allah wills.
The Fourth and Fortieth Chapter.
On the Affliction of the Neck and Pain.
If the pain and affliction of the neck is due to cold wetness, and not caused by a wound or illness, and the disease is chronic, then he should apply two cups in low, smooth, empty and clean places on the neck and another one in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cups should be cylindrical as shown in the figure, or if you wish, they could be cupped to the extent of a number of points similar to what is shown in the cupping of ear pain. And the points should be thirty in number.
Then he should treat it as mentioned before until it subsides, and a cup with three legs can be made on this figure and he should use it to cup once in three points. This is the figure of the cup.
The Fifth and Fortieth Chapter.
On the Abscess.
If the abscess bursts due to wet discharge, or does not heal when pressed, it is advisable to repeat the pressing until it becomes habitual, then it will burst again with the least movement as we have seen. In this case, the teeth should be bitten first. Then, the incision is made on his back or the correct side. Then, lift the skin that's inside the belly button up with your left hand's fingers if the division is present. If it isn't, it exposes itself within.
Then, sterilize the bottles with the black spots; this is their image.
Then, the skin is incised and stretched until it reaches the opposite side and takes the shape of four scoops, and if it is done with a bottle having three openings, its shape will be eight scoops and the openings on the surface of the object.
This is the image of the bottle with three openings.
And it can be increased by one to make eight scoops, then place the crushed kernels with salt on the incisions and bind the patient without moving the limb until he recovers, even if the division is above and the wound is stitched.
Cover the incision with a single, tight bandage or multiple bandages that seal it; as the division heals, the wound dries and the patient recovers.
The sixth and twentieth chapter.
In the incision of the arm.
If there occurs in a fracture excessive cold and much swelling, to the point that it separates from its joint, and there is an abundant flow towards it, and it pulsates with pulses of treatment, but it does not improve; it should be suspected that the cause lies on his surface. He should apply hot poultices to it and dip his hand and feet in warm water, then wrap it three times. Wrap one poultice under the armpit in the size of a handful with a bandage, and two below it on the side of the poultice until they form a triangular shape and are spaced apart so that if it heals, there will be space between them. The depth of each poultice should be approximately one-third the thickness of the skin, and the poultices should have the same shape.
On this image and in this size, without any more.
If you wish, wrap one large poultice in the center of the fracture on this image.
And the poultice that you wrap with this poultice should be circular in shape on this image.
If the fracture has been reduced by this treatment, then apply a point of medicine on it to the size you desire with a needle, then wrap it with a round poultice, and treat it with the remedy until it heals.
Chapter Seven and Forty.
On cold abdomens.
If [from the abdomen] there is a boil caused by heat or moisture, or by a foul smell that persists until it leaves its natural composition and appears in a disorderly manner, as we described in the classification [section], this will not be helpful. It is necessary for the suspect to be placed on his back and he should learn by practice three types in this manner on the abdomen, below the navel, where the human appendix ends.
After each type and type, he should be made to press hard on the fingernail with his whole hand, and the procedure should be carried out straight along the length of the body without bending the arm.
The amount of heat that burns the skin should be half, not more. The suspect should stand on his feet, if he cannot stand then let him sit with his legs raised and arms up [for the procedure], this is the image of the instrument (or knife).
You can perform these types with a scalpel if you have an assistant and are skilled in the craft, and be careful to avoid burning all the skin, burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines because the skin here is thin so be aware of it.
Chapter Eighty and Ten.
In Incision and Lancing of the Liver with a Lance.
If a tumor appears in the liver and you want to learn whether it is in the liver flesh or its membrane, if it is in the liver flesh, then it will be heavy and painful without any limits.
And if it is in the liver membrane, then it will be painful with a definite limit and you may perceive that the physicians have treated it. In such a case, the cause should be pressed to see its position, and then you shall learn about the location of the tumor by pressing.
Then, the cup is heated in fire, and this is the cup resembling a mill, here is its image. And it is heated with it until all the skin is burned and it reaches the membrane until all the pus comes out, then it is treated like an abscess until it heals.
This type of tumor should not be used except by one whose skill in medicine is long-established and who has experienced these diseases many times, so when he comes across a task like this, he shall perform it and leave it to me in the best way possible.
Chapter Nine and Forty.
On the treatment of ulcers.
The initial stages of cold ulcers are mentioned according to the roots of zirund, which is to take a long, thick piece of dried zirund root and to dip it in oil, then place it in the fire. Then, one piece of the zirund root is wrapped in a small amount, leaving some space between the roots and the neck, and two smaller pieces without any adherence on the side facing the flesh, and two large pieces above the breasts in the area between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more pieces on the side of the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly to the back, another one in the middle of the chest, and another one above the navel, three pieces from behind and one between the arms and two below the shoulder blades beneath the piece that is located between the arms.
And it is not recommended to insert your hand into the zirund root; instead, it should remain on the surface of the skin with a poultice. Some have reported that some people used an iron tube resembling a mile long, which they would heat and insert it into the ribs until it reached the site of the pain.
The abscess emerges as we have mentioned in the flank of the liver, and in this case, if the patient dies within an hour or not, there will be no relief for him.
Chapter Thirty.
In the case of fistulae.
If you treat the disease of fistulae by what we have described as treatment in division, your treatment will not succeed. In this case, on three aspects, all are correct: one, to suture it with three or four stitches along the length of the fistula.
The abscesses of the liver should be drained in the shape of liver abscesses, and there should be a space between each stitch as wide as the width of a finger or slightly less. The quality of the suture should be that which we have described for the liver abscess and should not penetrate deeply into the abscess. The patient's image should be exposed on his back.
The other aspect in the fistula is in the neck, and you should raise the skin that surrounds the fistula where the fistula of the patient ends and raise the skin that surrounds the left fistula. Your incision should be along the length of the body so that the stitches can be placed along the body.
Then the bladder stones enter a large cavity until they pass through them both (the cavities). Then the catheter is withdrawn, making four openings. If you wish to catheterize again with the three-pronged catheter.
Treat the place of the cataract after leaving it for several days to allow it to heal naturally, as it heals better than any other treatment.
The first and thirtieth chapter.
On cataract extraction.
The cataract is beneficial only for the extraction of dense cataracts, if the patient with a cataract is treated with the treatment we have mentioned in the division, it will not help your treatment. Therefore, you should make four incisions around the suture and one incision on the cornea.
Another incision is made on the abdomen, one on the navel, two behind his back between the ribs, and one on his chest and another on his cornea. The depth of the cataract should be close to the skin incision. Then leave the cataract open for a long period of time.
Do not delay treatment after the cataract has been made, it is necessary to gather all its benefits to speed up healing. The image of the catheter used for the back should be spiral in shape and that used for the forehead should be cylindrical.
Chapter Two and Thirty.
In the Legs and Feet [or Ankles].
If it is affected by tumor and filled with white water in the legs or feet, it is necessary to lance at the point between the ankle bone and heel.
Hold the lancet with your hand and do not bend it, then lift your hand and do not return it to its place for the white water will flow out and the lancet will remain in this shape.
Then lance twice in each foot, and the incision should be at the inner side of the lancet on the foot and one on top of the ankle bone and another below it towards the center of the foot, and on each leg twice.
Leave the incision open without treatment for a long time to let the water flow out, then treat it with everything we have mentioned before.
Chapter Three and Thirty.
In the Ulcers.
If the ulcer is due to cold and moisture until it weakens the immune system and inflammation in the body, treat it with appropriate medications and if the cause of the ulcer is not apparent and the strength is low, make a large incision on the affected area. According to what appears in any limb with a circular incision and four holes around the pit for sewing gently with a fine suture and a large knot on the skin above the muscle or two.
If you notice frequent and severe swellings, it is likely for that reason, so make a knot on the pain and a knot on each cyst and perhaps add two small knots near the large one, as it is an effective treatment whose benefit should be sought if God wills.
The Fourth and Thirtieth Section.
For the treatment of paralyzed limbs.
If in the paralyzed limbs there are numerous or single veins that are thick, cold, or swollen and painful as described in the section, then treatment is not effective. In such a case, make three knots below the shoulder blade slightly apart from each other.
If the limb is cold and there is no swelling or pain, and you notice its face is inflamed, make a large knot on the limb as described and another one on its belly. Another on a fracture with a malleolar splint, leave it open for some time then treat it until it heals, if God wills.
The Fifth and Thirtieth Chapter.
On Dislocations.
After cutting it, if the fingers have been separated, apply a splint that resembles a thread, then insert it into the severed fingers and hold it in place until the splint reaches the opening of the wound from where blood is discharging. Do this once or twice.
If there are many dislocations, treat each individually as previously described and heal them with what matches their type until they heal. Even if the splint is large on cotton, it will still be beneficial.
The Sixth and Thirtieth Chapter.
On Nasal Fractures in Seats and Their Surroundings.
If the cause of the fracture and the treatment described in its place are not necessary, then it is preferable to avoid splinting. However, if a nasal fracture occurs and bleeding and harmful secretions occur, first you should bind it with a thin thread.
Then, determine the size of the gap with the thread, then apply a splint that resembles a thread and insert it into the nasal cavity on top of the gap where the thread entered and tie the splint in place until the harmful secretions are burned, either once or twice or three times according to your needs.
"Preserve from burning the nerve if there is heat or great swelling, and if the nasal bone or cheekbone is fractured.
"Preserve all of these areas, and this should be done if the nasal bone is in a position of inflammation but not perforated; then treat the area until it heals. If the area is sutured and the materials are cut off, and it remains like that for some time, know that it has healed completely.
"If the materials are not cut off, know that it is perforated or in a bone cavity that is rotten or similar to that which was mentioned in its place.
"Chapter Seven and Thirty.
"In one of the kidneys.
"If an inflammation occurs in one of the kidneys, accompanied by fever or thick perspiration and a decrease in appetite, all the possible causes for this should be investigated; then it is necessary to incise on the same side of the kidney with three small, well-drilled holes (in each kidney) using the instrument described previously. This will yield better results.
"Chapter Eight and Thirty.
In the case of the bladder.
If it happens in the bladder, weakness and spasms due to cold or moisture to the point that the urine is not expelled; apply a catheter at the lower abdomen on the bladder where the hair of pain starts, and another one from the right side of the abdomen and another one from the left.
After the catheter from each side, it should be tightened and a catheter should be placed at the lower abdomen or two if necessary, and the catheter should be corded on what comes out.
The ninth and thirtieth chapter.
In the case of the womb.
If there is cold or moisture in the womb, restrain it from being wrapped and uncover it and release its pathway or if pain occurs during menstruation, it is necessary to insert three catheters around the abdomen as mentioned in the case of the bladder. A catheter on the intestines below the abdomen or two, and the catheter should be corded.
The fortieth chapter.
In the case of dislocation of the shoulder.
If there is an incorrect moisture in the shoulder, it can be a cause for its dislocation and if one part of the arm touches another, and if you find the dislocated place, there will be a gap; it is necessary to apply a catheter on the shoulder itself similar to a ring.
After learning how to drill around the truth as it rotates, it will be in the center of the circle and the cavity that presents its image in any given part. If this cavity does not appear, then use three small cavities from the large olive-oil cavity.
Sharpen the bit deeply up to the skin's thickness, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter One, Forty.
In the vein of women.
If a wound occurs in the hand and its cause is coldness and moisture, and treatment of the cause has been done as we have mentioned in the section on cauterization, but it does not heal within that time, then it is necessary to ease the affected area from thick mixtures such as honey or alum and similar substances.
Then burn the cavity and its face with either a medication that burns, or with fire, and the cavity with fire should be on several faces; one of them should be exactly on the wound, in three small cavities like this image.
Sharpen it deeply in a proper manner and there should be space between each cavity, and the cavities should be olive oil-sized, and one cavity may be in the center on top of the wound, so there will be four small cavities; if you prefer, burn it in the circle that was mentioned when the wound is open, with one cavity.
The circle should encompass all the flesh and burn the whole hair follicle, this is the characteristic of the cauterization in the female vulva if the wound is necessary for the flesh itself and does not extend to the vagina or anus.
If it extends to the vagina or anus, then it is two cauterizations on the vagina at the location indicated by the cause of the wound and a cauterization above the vulva with four fingers towards the hairy side, slightly, and the bowl should be sharp, and the depth of the cauterization should be only to the depth of the hair follicle.
If it indicates that the wound extends to nearly the fingers of a man, then apply cauterization where indicated by the needle, three or four or more if necessary, and if it indicates that the wound is beneath the buttocks towards the anus, then apply a single sharp cauterization.
Preserve in all cauterizations that it does not reach with the cauterization to the point of burning nerves or veins severely, for this may cause harm, ugliness, or delay.
I have seen two cases where cauterization was performed above the vulva and reached to the extent of causing the anus to be burnt until it reached the soles of the feet, which were all destroyed and then there was relaxation and death afterwards. If the wound is in both places together, then these two cauterizations should be carried out with this characteristic.
Some of the wise scholars have mentioned a type of suture called this, it is made of iron and its diameter is half a finger, and it is located near the mouth on the gum or slightly less, and inside this iron suture there is another suture and a third one.
Inside each suture there should be a knot at the distance of a knot-length, and the sutures should be open from both sides and their height should be approximately a knot or two knots, and it should have a clamp made of iron for the sutures, this is its appearance.
Then it is heated in the fire until it turns red and any impurity is burned, then it is placed on the wound and the healthy edge remains on the correct side, it is stitched three times in one go, then it is left for three days and it is kept moist with oil, leaving the wound open for some days.
Many are treated with lime until it becomes soft, he said to write this type of suture with a pen and its appearance is shown here and only a few people who can endure it, except that it is good for the one who can endure it and strikes its place.
The translation of the excerpt is: "As for the cautery with burning medications, it means making small incisions resembling a small wound into which glass tubes filled with metallic filings can be inserted.
"In their cavities, there should be a height of two small incisions or similar to them and between them there should be a space the size of a fingernail's width. They should both be open from below to above, and one could be sealed with another in this manner.
"Then, lower them onto the correct position and let the patient lie on his side. Take your hand with the thumb up. Pour water between the two circles (the incisions) which is heated slightly. Hold it for a sand-hour (60 minutes) and the patient should bear it patiently until it burns completely.
"Until the burn heals, raise your hand with the tool and wipe the heated water over the whole wound with cold water. Then leave it for three days, apply oil to it until the burn mark disappears, and leave it until the pain subsides as it is more beneficial.
"Then treat it with leeches until the pain subsides, if the pain spreads to the leg or foot, make a mold for holding water according to the wound made by the cautery, and this is the characteristic of heated water which has been proven in the treatment of medications.
Take from common salt and unslaked lime from each one a part, crush them both and put them in a new vessel that has been pierced at the bottom with a small hole suitable for letting through powder. Place another small vessel inside it filled with sand.
Pour hot water on the salt and lime until they are completely wet, then squeeze them both firmly with your hand and leave the vessel until the sharp water descends in the small vessel filled with sand, then collect all that water, and pour it again on another fresh salt and lime.
When it has become strong, it is useful for a variety of medical applications and in treating other body parts since it performs the work of fire with its full heat. Among the medicines, it also includes those that are similar to lime such as turpentine, tar, and lime combined with soap.
Galen asserts a story about an ancient man treating scrotum ulcers and ovarian abscesses, and he greatly emphasized his treatment. He claimed that no other remedy is necessary for it, and that it cures once in one application.
Galen might enter the bathhouse with it, and when he comes out, he may have been cured. If there is no green pitch, then take fresh pitch, grind it with something from pork fat, and place it on the scrotum at the site of the pain or in the vagina or in the anus.
And it should be applied and left for three hours or as long as is tolerable without burning, then enter it into the bathhouse. If he passes gas from his body, put him in water, because the pain will disappear by the grace of God. If it does not heal, repeat the treatment after ten days.
It cures, if God wills it. Also, know that no one should use this medicine except after cleansing the body. Dioscorides has also said that if a donkey is afflicted with ovarian abscess and women's vaginal discharge is poured into its anus, it is beneficial for him.
The cyst shall be of this nature, take cotton and soak it in ancient oil and place it on the deep site that is between the knuckle and the wrist and closest to the wrist. Then, take a dry pouch made of gauze.
Heat it with fire until it becomes a blister, then place it on the cotton and leave it to cool down, then take another one but continue doing this until the sensation of pain reaches the middle of the arm and the boil is healed by God's permission. This beating of the cyst is called the "pouch-cyst".
The second and fortieth section.
In a boil on the back.
A boil on the back may occur due to various causes such as falling or hitting, or abscess caused by cold and moist material. The cyst belongs only to this category.
When the cause of the abscess is cold matter, after the source has been removed, it should be opened on the back where the boil is, in three layers following the same outline of the shoulder. The location should be determined by measurement in each layer with five or more cysts depending on the possibility and strength of the cause.
The cavity should be made with a point-tipped instrument, and if you wish to make cavities of three or four points, do so with a median-sized drill on this image.
The third and tenth section.
In incision for abscess.
Frequently, this disease appears in small children and a sign of its onset in the child is that he experiences shortness of breath while at rest and moving, and you will find in the last days of his fever red spots spreading over other spots.
If you see this and wish to stop it, make an incision in a circular shape on this image. Take the instrument on every side of the spot, and if you wish to make incisions around the spot, do so with a point-tipped instrument, two or three points and let the points be close to each other, then treat the area until it heals as we have described.
And remember to use the instrument for the abscess that is caused by gangrene.
The fourth and twenty-fourth section.
In incision for fractures and dislocations.
If fractures and dislocations are due to cold wetness in a body part, if they occur in the legs for example, it is common among doctors to call this a special type of fracture called "the fracture".
If a cold probe causes pain during treatment and the wounds do not heal, it means that the disease is in the part we mentioned in the sectioning. In this case, apply numerous cupping glasses around the division of the legs. The cups should be medium-sized and filled with olive oil on this image.
If it is necessary to pierce the face of a man, perform cupping on the point. If the wounds spread to the ankles or to other joints and it often occurs, apply numerous cups around each ankle with this medium-sized olive oil-filled cup from every side.
If more than this amount of cupping is required, apply and do not press deeply with the cups but rather about the thickness of the skin only. If the wounds spread to the wrists or to the back, use what we mentioned in the chapter regarding cupping.
If the wounds are only on the hands, pierce around the wrists as if rotating twice. If the wounds remain in the fingers, puncture each joint with a point and on the palm. If the wounds spread after several days to the extremities or to the back.
Apply them from every side, and let not the cause of harm come from good management and the taking of medicine. If the best food is consumed and the bladder is emptied, it will pass with this [procedure], if God wills.
The fifth and forty-fourth chapter.
In the case of strangulated hernia.
If a strangulated hernia appears in the right or left groin and some swelling and soreness have appeared at its base, and this has occurred relatively soon, it is necessary to order that food be abandoned for the day and that one use emetics to bring up whatever pus may be in his belly.
Then he should be laid down on his back between your hands, and ordered to hold himself until the swelling or soreness appears, then you should press it with your fingers. Then you should learn by palpation under the hernia, on the bone of the iliac crest, a sign resembling half a circle, the edges of which are towards the upper abdomen.
Then this cavity is cauterized.
Until the pus comes out and the swelling or soreness is brought into his belly, then a servant's hand is placed on the spot to prevent the swelling from appearing again. When it has subsided between the thighs of the patient, another servant ties him up.
The last one (on the skull) is held with his hand, then the trepan is placed on its mark and you hold it firmly until it reaches the bone or you return it again if it does not reach the bone at first.
Keep your grip to prevent the drill from burning (the bone). This can lead either to death or serious injury. Know that if you do not reach the bone with the drill, the operation has failed. The trepan for children should be soft and appropriate for their size, and for adults it should be according to their size.
Treat the wound with oil for three days until the swelling subsides due to the fire, then treat it with other medications until it heals and the patient remains comfortable on his back for forty days until the incision is closed.
It is important to make his diet soft for the duration of his treatment so that he does not feel discomfort during or after the drilling, then if he wishes to stand up after forty days, a firm belt should be used and held for another four days, with less movement and reduction in fatigue, food, drink and smoking.
If this treatment is applied in this manner, it heals completely, God willing. I will mention the treatment for the fracture that occurs in the skull, if God wills, and as for the fracture that happens in other parts of the body, and started early, if you wish it not to grow further, seal the fracture with a firm material according to its capacity. Make the part of the skin burnt similar to a third, then treat it as we have described before, and it will not grow any further, God willing. Some initial treatments suggest sealing the fracture with a three-piece plaster, on this image.
Learn to suture the fracture and straighten the line that is on the upper side of the fracture and the other one at the bottom, and move your hand in the middle with a single suturing needle. The first stitch should be easy and best, God willing.
The Sixth and Fortieth Chapter.
In cases of hemorrhage.
If in any part of the body there is a wound or blow and the pain lasts for a long time and treatment with drugs does not relieve it, then it should be sealed with sutures and each part according to its size and weakness and strength.
The wound and the ulcer are enabled. If the first cauterization is avoided, it will recur. Since it is common for such wounds to migrate from one part to a place near it, it is necessary to follow it with cauterization until the cause is removed.
The Seventh and Forty-Seventh Section.
On Cauterization of the Fistula.
Benefit of Cauterization for Fistulas: Those suffering from fistulae can greatly benefit and without a doubt, find relief from the type of fistula that is due to previous inflammation and ulceration.
If you wish to cauterize, first ensure that the fistula is new and has not been treated with what we have previously described in this section and has not ceased nor stopped. Suspect that corruption may take over all of its aspects if not dealt with promptly. Apply four cauterizations on the fistula's opening, one after the other, in a circular motion. One in the middle of the head, the second below it towards the neck at the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one behind on the occipital bone. Hold the cauterizer slightly to ensure it affects the bone gently.
After removing the scabs from it, the thick phlegm inside is released and a cauterization is also applied on the same spot as it progresses, and if the fistula persists and becomes evident, these previously mentioned cauterizations in the head should be performed. Incision on the side of the nose and two on the ears, two on the temples, four on the neck vertebrae, four on the dorsal vertebrae, one large one at the wrist when paralyzed by the arm, another over it in the same cavity, and two on each shoulder blade. Two on each forearm, one on every finger joint and two on the wrist bones of both hands and feet, an incision on every knuckle of his fingers and toes.
Preserve the bone at the back of the knuckles to prevent burning them. An incision may be made on the bone of the pinky, one on the jawbone and another on the abdomen. Know that each additional incision is beneficial and advantageous.
Know that the healthy bone will not feel pain, but the fractured one will. The incisions should be made of various sizes according to the limb and joints, depending on the characteristics of the nails.
Then, the fractured bone is treated with fine-grained corrosive antimony and other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter eighty-four.
In case of a fracture of any limb, if it cannot be moved with medications and bandages or splints, then treat the fractured limb with keys according to the size or smallness of the bone, and make the keyholes small and narrow in the skin incision slightly.
Then treat it with the trepan, until it can be moved. Some fractures exposed to hand and leg may appear in the lower back near the exit of the spinal cord that moves this limb, so the fracture goes away.
And this should not be done except by one who is experienced in cutting limbs and the exits of movable spinal cords of the body.
Chapter ninety-four.
In case of abscess.
If the abscess does not improve with any treatment from medical methods, then make a small keyhole in it with a slight depth according to the thickness of the skin until the pus goes away and its color changes.
Then treat it with fine sawdust of the walnut shell, olive oil, or camel's blood, or pig's blood mixed from each part and stir all together, apply it to the wound, and press it until it can be moved.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On Cancer.
If the cancer is in its beginning and you wish to stop it, confine it with a circular band around it, as it rotates; some of the wise have said that it should be confined with a broad knife in the middle, but I do not see this because I expect it to break out, and I have seen that happen several times.
The correct way is to confine it with a circular band, as we have said, or with many knives.
Chapter One Hundred and Fifty-One.
On the Diphtheria.
If diphtheria occurs in someone and he has stopped bleeding, either from the agent causing it or from a predisposing condition, if he is elderly with little blood, or if time has passed, and you wish to hasten the healing of the diphtheria, confine it with many small knives, puncturing it.
Then leave it, as it will heal quickly; if you wish to press it with the knife, apply the forceps shown in this figure.
Lower it into the middle of the diphtheria until the flesh emerges, so that the knife is below the lesion to facilitate the flow of pus; then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Two and Fifty-Six.
In the Matter of Bleeding.
The Matter of Bleeding: It is a corruption that consumes the body, as fire consumes dry wood; if you see bleeding in a place where there is possibility of burning, wrap many layers of small and large bandages accordingly for that place where bleeding occurs.
Then, apply it from all sides until the corruption is completely destroyed and nothing remains of it, then leave it for three days and apply large layers of quicklime mixed with oil on the bandages until all the dryness and all the corruption is cured.
Then, treat it with growing flesh for meat; if after three days you see that the meat is growing healthily without any corruption in it, then proceed to cauterize what remains of the corrupted places, as the bleeding can also be treated with caustic medicines.
It is faster to apply heat with fire; I have previously mentioned its treatment with caustic medicines in the division, so take it whenever necessary from there.
Chapter Three and Fifty-Six.
In the Matter of Straight and Bent Needles.
Often occurs in the soles of the feet this condition, it is a hard lump that afflicts the man, and it may be one of two types: either burning (Kiyy) with fire or cutting (Kiyy) with sharp water.
As for the Kiyy with fire, it is to heat a curved metal instrument similar to an eagle's beak made of iron and adjustable from all sides and thin at the edge. Then lower it on the nail and move your hand around the nail until the instrument reaches the depth of the nail.
And it remains for three days with pain, then tighten it with a sharp, rough pincer made of salt and leave the pinching on it overnight as it will dissolve from its roots. Then treat the wound with raw lard until it heals, if the nails are not crooked.
Often occurs on the surface of the body, particularly in the hands and feet. It is necessary to take a cannula made of copper or iron or an eagle's beak and place it on the nail or wart, then pour boiling water into the cannula as much as possible.
Your hand should be grasped and it should be rotated slightly with your thumb so that the pressure affects the anus in the center of the ligature, and the hot water will find its way to the center of the ligature. The patient should bear the pain of the hot water for an hour.
Leave it thus, the ligature will dissolve from its roots. Treat each area in this manner until it reaches all parts of the body. Then treat the affected areas after it has dissolved with cauterization using caustic agents such as lye.
The fourth and fifth sections.
For the paralytics.
If paralysis due to a fever or other causes occurs in a person, it is necessary to tie four or five knots on the back between each row of knots and one on the chest. And a knot with a bayberry kernel on his person, as paralytics find relief and speed in the recovery of cold diseases.
The fifth and sixth sections.
For the treatment of abscesses in the body.
If an abscess occurs in the body made of hard, rotten and harmful materials, it is necessary to tie a soft knot on each abscess with a goat's foot that has been heated over a fire or long zarand, or with a fig kernel.
The fractures occur initially in this state, they do not increase and the active principle of healing is agitated by it, except that it should be after the relief of the cause by cutting.
The sixth and fiftieth [chapter or section].
On the case of the dislocations occurring upon severing the ligaments.
Frequently, the dislocation of blood from ligaments occurs due to injury that exposes it from outside or due to fracture or wound or similar cases, and it becomes difficult to cut it.
If this happens to someone, hurry with your hand to the ligament area and place your thumb on it and press firmly until the blood is trapped under your thumb and nothing comes out of it, then put small and large, numerous clay vessels with olive oil in it and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is cut and the vein descends on the same limb. After you have amputated your finger with a saw, hold the vessel until the blood stops flowing.
If the artery is cut during the amputation of your finger, and the vessel descends, take another vessel with the saw from the vessels prepared in the fire, and continue to do so one after the other until the blood stops flowing.
And keep a spare vessel nearby in case there is a need for another, and know that if the artery releases blood, it cannot be stopped unless it is one of the four ways: either by pressing (with a finger) as we have mentioned, or by applying a tourniquet if it has not yet swollen. If the artery is torn and blood flows, tie it with strong and secure threads or apply medicines that are known to stop bleeding and cause severe constriction.
And whoever tries to stop it with ropes or excessive pressure, or by applying hot objects and similar things, it will not stop the bleeding except in extreme cases. If someone is shown any of these and there is no doctor or medicine present, they should place a splint on the wound as we have described.
He should press it strongly until the blood congeals and coagulates from above the wound and on the arteries and veins, and he does not release it with cold water. The extreme cold should always be applied to it, until the blood thickens, hardens, and breaks, and during this time one must observe what requires it of any drug or substance.
Chapter Two.
On cuts, wounds, amputations and similar matters.
As we have mentioned in the first chapter, every disease is cured with fire and burning medicines, their causes and instruments, and the shapes of bandages, and we made this a comprehensive guide from head to foot.
In this chapter, I will present that method clearly to make it easy for the student to understand.
Before I begin with that, it is important for you to understand that this chapter contains more subtle matters than what was discussed in the first chapter on fire and burning medicines.
Due to this, caution is required because the work in this chapter often involves the loss of blood, which sustains life when an artery or vein is cut or injured due to a wound, puncture, incision, operation, or similar matters, all of which are accompanied by great fear and danger, and death occurs frequently in many of them.
I advise you regarding what contains ambiguity among you; indeed, it may occur to you in this craft, people with various ailments, from whom one may have injured by his disease and death approaches him.
I advise you regarding what causes pain and length of the wound, and the approaching of death by his disease, which indicates death. From them are those who spend their wealth for you in hope of health and cure of his disease, but do not aid you from one who is cowardly.
Be cautious of your eagerness and beware of that which is not certain, do not proceed with anything except after clear evidence that it leads to the praised outcome. Use knowledge and caution in all treatment of your diseases, and always consider safety.
Indeed, in this there is a means to gain praise and glory, rememberance and admiration. May Allah guide you and grant you success, for that is in His hand, there is no deity but Him.
This chapter has been expanded on the subject of the calf from the neck to the foot, so as to clarify for you what is intended by it, if Allah wills.
Chapter One.
Treatment of water that accumulates in children's heads.
This swelling often appears in children during birth if the head of the newborn is pressed without support, and it can also occur due to a hidden cause that is not known.
I have not seen this cause in anyone other than children, and all whom I saw with it were quicker to die for that reason. Therefore, I observed leaving work on it and have seen children whose heads became full of water, and the head swells daily. Until the child cannot sit on himself due to swelling of his head, and moisture increases until he dies.
This moisture may either gather between the skin and bone or accumulate beneath the skull, and work on it should be done if the moisture is between the skin and bone and the abscess is small. In such a case, one incision should be made centrally in the head and should be wide enough to alleviate the moisture, which is referred to as lancing.
If the moisture increases and the worm becomes larger, make two intersecting incisions on this shape:
And if the moisture is under the bone and its sign is that you see hair tufts opening from all sides, and water decreases when you squeeze it with your hand, and this is not hidden for you, then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head on this shape.
After the incision, all the moisture comes out, then close the incisions with stitches and ointment, leave it for five days, then dissolve the bandage and treat the wound with olive oil and honey, do not leave the scalp unattended and nourish the patient with dry food of little moisture.
Until the limb recovers and heals, another incision method is to look where the worm bone appears and where water gathers, as it may be deeper in the head or at its base or on the right or on the left.
The incision means where the worm appears and water accumulates, so make an incision wherever you can and ensure that you cut nerves to cause bleeding that will kill the patient from the bleeding with the loss of moisture.
Chapter Two.
Section of cutting the two veins behind the well-known ears (temporal veins).
When a hard boil appears near the eyes or chest and the remedy does not help, treatment in such case is by cutting these two veins.
Before cutting them, the head of the patient should be shaved with a razor, then the place should be scratched strongly to make the veins appear, then the back of the patient's head should be pressed with a thick cloth, then look for where the pulsation is and their two lowered locations behind the ears, which are not visible except in some people.
Then press them with a tourniquet and cut them, cutting deep to the bone, this should be done at the head level, and if you wish, introduce the tourniquet from below the veins and tighten it upward with the cut being about two closed fingers in length.
If the artery is cut, blood will flow out in a pulsating manner towards the face and damp clothes, if the vein does not appear to be felt, it is necessary to probe from the ear at a distance of three fingers, then press with a tourniquet and press deeply to the bone.
Send vessels from the blood on the median part, and maybe send more or less from it, all of this according to the degree of weakness of the patient and his condition; then observe the wound. If it remains attached to the bone from the puncture, cut it off.
If a hot abscess occurs, then squeeze the wound with a walnut-sized piece of linen and treat it with the merumah until it opens up.
Third Chapter.
On the incisions in the armpits.
If a person has a chronic or acute swelling, hardening, and heat in the armpits or shoulder caused by persistent, harsh sweating and heat, and if treatment with conventional medicines does not work, we have tried this method for such diseases: Make an incision in the armpit or similar as described.
The method is to shave the patient's hair in the armpit, targeting the visible swelling in the shoulder, as it will become apparent to you from its pulsation and what is not hidden among individuals of different natures.
If there is severe cold, it will be hidden from you; in this case, have the patient rub his neck with his clothing, then feel the location with a probe or wet the location with hot water until the swelling appears clearly and distinctly. Then take the arm whose likeness this is. (Direct translation of the Arabic text) Then cut the skin along with it, until you reach the armpits; then insert a probe in it and draw it upwards until it comes out of the skin; extract and clean it from the scabs on all sides; if the armpits are narrow, press the probe towards one side. (Direct translation of the Arabic text) Then cut a piece from it according to the distance between its edges, and do not cause bleeding; if it does not swell or is not cut, there will be no flow of blood at all; then evacuate the blood from four to three veins. (Direct translation of the Arabic text)
If the armpits are large, it is necessary to tie them in two places with a strong thread; let the thread be either from a bowstring or from the strings of a lute, so that pus does not rush before the wound heals and bleeding occurs. (Direct translation of the Arabic text)
Then cut a piece between the ties, do this during that hour or at a later time; if you wish, insert a small pointed probe into the bone until it swells around its edges; the position for this operation should be done with care or as we have mentioned before. (Direct translation of the Arabic text)
If the cause is a wound or fracture, because the bone marrow softens when affected by moisture, it should be set in good alignment. After cleansing the wounds, the site should be sutured with catgut and proper bandages placed on it. After setting, it should be treated with dry medicines that promote healing and ointments until, God willing, it heals.
If, during your work, a wound occurs, it is best to cut it with a knife or fill the site with zaiq (a type of ointment) and press firmly until the blood stops flowing. If nothing comes out of this, place your finger on it until it clots.
Wet the wound with cold water until it shrinks and hardens to the desired state, and what is easier and less troublesome than cleansing the wounds is to fill them with this spoon-like tool with holes (makwaat) after learning how to apply medicines to the wounds.
Lower it (the fractured bone) to a great height until it reaches the bone and the flesh is cut in two places so that there is space between them, for this lever does not affect the fracture. This is an image of the spoon-like tool.
The blades should be sharp, resembling the smaller knives except that it should be less in size as both of them are quick to catch cold and the flesh does not separate quickly if they are sharp like knives; therefore, if there is any hardness in them, hold fire on them.
The flesh should be separated quickly, and this is the best, easiest, and most convenient of all work; let there be a space between the blades equal to the width of the thumb.
The Fourth Section.
Treatment of Permanent Hot Tears to the Eyes.
If the tears are permanent and the discharge is from the openings on the forehead, and there is no remedy with any medicine for them, and you see that the face of the patient is red. When he feels a swelling in his cheeks like the swelling of ants and his eyes are sunken, softened due to the tears, and they have been eroded by the tears so that their eyelashes fall off, and the patient is forced to seek treatment for it, this procedure is called "the operation with a sword," which means to order the patient to shave the hair on his head.
Then make three incisions in the forehead, parallel to its length, and the length of each incision should be about two fingers. The first incision should be in the center of the forehead, the second one a little distant from the movement of the muscle that is in the cheek, and the third one on the other side.
Keep the cheekbones that are on the sides and move your hand away from the connection of the jaws, and the distance between each incision should be about three fingers. Carry a sponge soaked with hot water or a thin probe that bleeds much blood.
Then enter the narrow probe, the shape of which is shown in the image. Move the probe from the incision in front of the cheek to the central incision and scrape all the skin between the two incisions along with the bone knife, then do the same from the central incision to the third incision, then remove this probe. Enter the first incision again with another tool called a scalpel, sharp on one side and dull on the other side, and this is its shape:
One side of it should be sharp, directed above the fat attached to the skin, and the other side should be blunt towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the central incision and cuts all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without cutting the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do that in the central cavity to the other cavity, and when it is filled with balanced amount of blood, the areas will be hardened from the thick blood clot, then it will become soft in every cavity, making a pus-like substance from cotton dipped in oil or grease and fat.
In the third day, the stitches dissolve and a lot of discharge occurs with warm water, then it is treated with the pastes made of pine resin and other things used in surgeries until it heals, if Allah wills.
The fifth section.
Treatment of tears and secretions from the eye to the brain in the head.
If a person has persistent, severe and burning secretions, and both eyes appear watery with two small protruding holes and their vision is weak and the lashes fall out from them. And there is a pain deep in the head and continuous bleeding, know from these symptoms that these secretions come from many large veins, and the best treatment for this is as follows: order the patient to shave their face, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is a pain deep in the head and continuous bleeding, know from these symptoms that these secretions come from many large veins, and the best treatment for this is as follows: order the patient to shave their face, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. And lower it slightly in width, and start from the left arm pit to the right arm pit, and let the incision be towards the bone. Keep your hand away from the moving sinews near the joint until you reach the bone and drain all the blood with a syringe.
Make a distinction between the cuts of the vein or artery from the joint, then press from above with the pads and drink the liquid and oil so that it does not cause a hot fever. When it is healed and you see that the hot fever has ended, it is necessary to cure the bone until vegetation begins in it of flesh.
Then treat it with dry treatment that causes flesh to grow, such as taking from barley flour a handful and four portions of the calves' fat, which are kneaded together and used to cause growth of flesh in similar surgeries.
Chapter Six.
Treatment of what falls into the ear.
Whatever falls into the ear is of four types, either a mineral stone or one resembling a stone such as iron and glass, or a plant seed such as peppercorns and beans, or something liquid like water and honey and similar things.
If an animal falls into the ear, and a stone or any object that does not grow in the ear enters it, accept sunlight on the ear. If you see the stone, squeeze some oil (either olive oil or castor oil) onto it, then try to remove it by moving the head or blowing air with reeds. Plug the external ear canals when dealing with an earwax buildup, after applying a plaster or cotton around the ear and pulling it downwards, often the wax will come out with this treatment. If not, try to remove it gently using the following technique (depicted in the image).
If it comes out with the gentle plucking and not otherwise, try to remove it using a delicate copper loop, if that does not work either, make a tube from copper and insert one end of the tube into the ear canal.
"Sew up the opening around the anus with a thin layer of fat to ensure that the air has no exit other than the anus, then strongly draw it back using your breath. If it does not come out as we described, take thread from your mouth or from a rolled-up piece of cloth which birds take easily and place it on the side of the wound.
"After applying a firm plaster, insert it into the ear canal after draining the ear of moisture. If it does not come out as described, seek the wound before the inflammation or abscess occurs.
"Description of the wound: Pull the hair in the temple and have it bleed to a degree proportional to its strength, then hold the hair between your hands and tilt the ear towards above and make a small hole in the center of the ear at the low part of it when the earlobe is stretched out.
"The wound shall be a shallow cut until it reaches the bone, then remove it with whatever tools you can and sew up the wound quickly and treat it to make it heal.
"If the object is a popcorn kernel that expands and grows, try to extract it as we described. If it does not come out, take a thin needle and carefully poke this image.
Try to cut that type of falling grain from the ear, and this is done only when you are certain that the grain has softened with the heat of the ear until it becomes small pieces, then extract them with a curved iron hook or with a thin tweezers or a needle.
As mentioned earlier, it is easier to extract it. Regarding the water inside the ear, it should first be treated with hot oil or glycerin, and a piece of cotton wool soaked in it should be placed on the affected ear. If it is removed with this, the water will come out along with it.
Hold a large number of small pebbles, grind them and heat them slightly. Take one of them and insert it into the ear canal, then strike with another stone on the one inside the ear.
He continues to do this with a stone, a stone until all the water comes out. The water may come out by taking from the nose or the ear, and he puts one side of it in the ear and holds the other side with fire until it burns more of it, then he returns another splinter.
He does this repeatedly until all the water comes out or attracts it with a tube to what advances in the stone, and as for extracting the animal inside it (if there is any), if it is small such as a grub or similar, he treats it as mentioned in the previous section, otherwise...
If the creature is large and can be felt, he tries to extract it with forceps and scissors, making it easier than anything that may appear in the ear. As for removing the worms born in the ear, if you have treated it as mentioned in the previous section about tumors and it has not benefited, then...
It is necessary to look at the ear in the sun, if you see something like a worm, extract it with forceps or soft scissors, but if nothing appears from it, take this tube (image)...
Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, insert a thin tool into the ear up to the limit it can reach, then press strongly until all pus comes out. If it does not come out, damage will occur around the tubes with oil as I have previously mentioned in the section on wounds.
If it does not come out as described, use the ear drops that I have previously mentioned for treating boils and you will find this in the article on ear drops. Your solution will be to use salve and medicine inside the ear with this device and here is its image:.
As you can see, it is made of gold or copper with a narrow bottom and wide top. If you prefer, the plunger inside the tube can be made of brass and if you wish, you can use a reed and wrap it tightly around its edge.
Then apply the oil or ointment, or any other medicine you prefer in the tube which is in the ear, and then insert the reed with the cotton wrapped around it from above and press gently until the oil is pushed into the auditory canal and feels warm.
With the patient inside, ensure that whatever is in the ear remains slightly warm and avoid anything too cold or too hot as the ear cannot withstand this.
Chapter Seven.
Treatment of the oblique perforating ear wound.
Children may come out of their mothers' wombs and their eardrums intact.
Also, a wound in the auditory canal may occur due to injury or growth of abscess within it, and this wound may be deep within the ear canal, not visible to the naked eye.
If the wound is slightly exposed and visible to the naked eye, it will usually be easier to cure; if it is deep within the ear canal and not visible, it will be more difficult to cure. In such a case, it should be recommended to expose the affected ear to sunlight. If you observe the wound and see it exposed, open it gently with a probe; its shape should be like this:.
Its edge should be open slightly and limited on one side, while the rest of the probe should be pressed gently against both sides to avoid damaging the ear; if the wound is due to growth of abscess within the auditory canal, grasp it with a gentle forceps and cut it off completely, taking care not to leave any flesh.
If the wound is deep within the ear canal, take a hot probe and gently press it into the wound; if you feel resistance or pressure in the wound along with the patient's sensation of hearing loss, press firmly to release the pus.
Preserve [the patient] from injuring the eardrum, then make an incision in the ear to a degree that fits the size of the wound. In the Egyptian mummy (marrow), do this for several days until the danger of infection or bleeding has passed, or take canola oil, heat it and apply powdered zaj on top.
If you see the ear swollen and very hot, it is necessary to drain the canola oil and replace it with another canola oil made in lard until the hot inflammation subsides, then treat it until it heals completely.
If bleeding occurs, immerse cotton or lint in cold water and place it on the ear. Use the treatment mentioned in the article on cataracts to stop the bleeding.
The Eighth Chapter.
Treatment of swellings that occur in the earlobes.
These swellings that occur in the eyelids may be wet or dry. It is necessary to grasp them with tweezers or a ring and cut them from their roots, then apply powdered zaja to the location.
If bleeding occurs, cover it with a soft catapult and press better after cutting, as there is often something left from the roots. If it is burnt, the roots will not grow back.
The Tenth Chapter.
Treatment of Severe Chill in Orbital Fistula of the Eye.
Often in fistula, something resembling chill occurs due to its severity and hardness.
Therefore, it was named "chill" (barud). It is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower fistula, and work should be done by observing whether the chill is prominent on the surface of the fistula. If so, it will move to all sides easily. It should then be broken open with a force parallel to its width.
Then, I shall make an incision from all sides, extending until it clears out, then attach it to the scrotum and cut it, but if it does not agree (with you), do not cut it except after performing the amputation of the member. In that case, there is no harm in it. If the wound is large, gather it with sutures and treat it until it heals completely.
If the wound is small, there is no problem with it. The worms will naturally force themselves out and bite. If the abscess is close to the inside of the scrotum towards the inner surface of the scrotum, turn the scrotum over and attach the abscess to the scrotum without making an incision and incise it from all sides.
After performing amputation of the member, it causes no harm. Then, wash the eye with salty water after cutting the abscess and treat the location with what bites until it heals completely.
The Tenth Chapter.
Treatment of the worm infestation that occurs in the scrotum of the eye.
The worm (sand fly) is a parasite found in the upper layers of the scrotum, and it often affects children. It causes heaviness in their eyes and makes them sensitive to sunlight during the day, making it difficult for them to see clearly. To make the eye run water.
To make the eye laugh (cry). Put their faces on permanent surfaces and let them sleep on it, making their eyes wet under the eyelids with moisture or applying snakeroot oil. When the situation is set with your fingers, feel for the snakeroot between them. The method is to place the patient's head on a stone.
Then take a small boxwood cup and carve it into a bowl shaped like the snakeroot. Make a circle on the bowl with the same diameter as the snakeroot from all sides. Place the bowl over it and press it with your fingers from all sides to gather the snakeroot in the center of the circle.
Then, with the long blade of a scalpel, make an incision on the snakeroot in the length direction but not wider than the width. As for depth, make sure to cut the skin all the way down to the snakeroot.
In most cases, the snakeroot will emerge from the incision like a piece of white cheese. Use forceps that you have previously wrapped with your fingers to grasp and pull it outwards. Control your hand movements so that it comes out entirely and be careful not to widen the incision too much to avoid injuring the eye.
If the ulcer does not appear at the beginning of the incision, it is necessary to increase the incision slightly, and when the ulcer appears, attract it as we have said before, then press it with a plaster in the wound and water, and place it on the location and squeeze it with force, and among people there are some who grind salt.
Place it in the depth of the incision to drain the remaining moisture, then treat it until it drains. If a hot abscess occurs at the location, treat it with compressed leeches until it drains.
Chapter 10.
On the Affliction of Eyelid Swelling.
If a swelling of excess eyelashes grows in the canal under natural lashes and is not cleaned regularly, it will harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, inflammation, yellowing, and whitening until that becomes a reason for blindness.
The eyelid swelling can occur in four ways: either by burning with fire or applying harsh medication on what comes out through the eye canal, or it may be caused by cutting and stitching or by bruising what I have mentioned.
It is necessary to make the root of the vein in your palm, then turn the inner side of the eye with your left hand. If it turns, otherwise insert a needle into which you tie a thread from below the eyelid and pull the needle through with the thread above, which will be close to the hair itself and attract the thread to above the eyelid.
Turn it with a probe, then pierce inside the eyelid without the excess hair using the largest needle and thread from the larger vein to the smaller one, then unravel the thread and place a small incision made of cotton or a splinter under the eyelid, then suture the eyelid.
Like the shape of a camel's hump, it is necessary that the shape be according to the extent to which you want to raise the eyelid as it may vary among people, and there are some who may require cutting the eyelid to an appropriate degree so that the eyelid remains raised.
And there are some who require less of that, to the extent needed for the eyelid to remain raised, then pierce with a needle along the lines you sutured, starting from the larger vein to the smaller one, and the single piercing should be close to the natural hair, like the probe.
Then the cautery enters one corner of the skin, then it is scraped all over, then the two threads are gathered with a suture needle and thin yarn, and the blood is smeared and what remains of the threads is stuck to the wounds with some adhesive substances.
Then do that, otherwise it is of no benefit; then the sutures remain for about three or four days, and then treatment is applied to them, and if you prefer not to suture the wound and treat it with something that dries and tightens, the swelling rises when the wound is closed and sutured, and suturing is better.
This is one of the methods of cautery, except that it has a therapeutic effect on the underlying cause and is good work with little risk; the other method of cautery is to teach the swelling in the form of an ox hide as we have described. Then the swelling is raised by three cauterizations, which are either separate or grouped in this position:
Then the excess from the swelling is cut with small scissors on this position, cut in equal parts:.
If you are unable to hold the cauterizations and they do not fit for you, take a suture needle with thread in it and insert it into the center of the shape and insert another thread near the largest vein and the third thread near the smallest vein and gather the threads equally by your fingers then raise them evenly.
Lift the skin on which the incision is made, as previously described, then gather the edges of the wound by sewing and treat it until it heals over. If redness or inflammation appears when you cut or open it, treat that inflammation with coriander poultices or similar soothing herbs.
In case the edges of the wound turn inward, it is necessary to use what we have previously described, that is to cut and sew and cauterize with fire or strong medicines. The cutting and sewing should be done on both sides so as to close the wound.
The cauterization with hot iron is to be done when the wound turns inward and an opening appears, as previously described, then make two or thin wooden sticks the same length as the wound and place them on its edge so that their width is less than the width of the incision.
Once the threads have been fixed in both sides where the stitches are, they should be tied together gently on top of the eyelid and the wooden sticks should be pressed firmly from both sides, leaving it for a few days. The skin which has been cauterized will die, turn black and heal.
Until it falls by itself, if it is not removed, bind it with a ligature, then treat it until it becomes soft. If the tumor rises, and does not enter the eye sockets, this is the image of the testicles made in this shape and size in length and width:.
The second section:
To raise the ingrown hair from the eye with a lancet.
If there is hair or two hairs involved in the process, take a sharp lancet and insert a thin cotton thread made of fine, soft silk. Then tie the ends together to form a very delicate knot. The length of the thread should be about half an inch.
Then place another thin thread on top of the first one, tie their ends if desired, and position the patient's head on a hard surface near the sun to improve visibility since this is precise work. Next, insert the lancet with the thread into the ingrown hair root.
Insert the lancet into the eyelid until it exits from above the natural hair, then draw the thread to the surface and insert the thread back into the eyelid, if there is one or two or three hairs.
Then pull the eyelid with it until the ingrown hair along with the thread exits from the eyelid together with the natural hair. If you have pulled the thread but the ingrown hair has not come out with it, pull the thread back down to the upper hole until the thread exits from the upper hole.
Then let the hair grow in it, and gather them together. Do this until they rise to the top of the wound and can be seen by the eye. When that happens, excise the activity and the thread, then sew up the eye and leave it sutured for a few days or three, so that the hair remains in place and flesh grows on it.
If the hair is short, then either add long natural hair to it so that they both grow together, or leave it as it is for a while until it grows longer. When it has grown enough, lift it up.
The Third Chapter.
Treatment of the Squint That Occurs in the Upper Eye Corner.
This squint, which is called strabismus, may be either congenital or acquired. The acquired form results from injury or disease of the eye or similar conditions.
The method of treatment is to make the injury heal by separating the eyes and forming a membrane between them until it heals, and it is not advisable to use any substances that dry or contract in its treatment.
If you do this, the squint will return even more severely than before. Instead, use substances that soften such as honey and oil mixed with water, apply a paste made from cotton and bandage material dipped in grease and let it stay until it heals. Heal it with this.
Physicians should probe with all means except that they do not return to the original site, and this action which we have mentioned is one of the corrections for fistula, it does not return the location to its former state.
The fourth section.
Treatment of the fistula that is in the lower abdomen.
This fistula, which is below [in the lower abdomen], is in reality called a fistula and it is natural and it is linear. The linearity is due to injury or tear or something similar.
The method of working on it is to take a catgut and stitch it in the flesh and pass it from the left side to the right side until the thread becomes at the edge of the flesh, then move the flesh up with the catgut and cut it with a sharp knife.
If the shape of the abdomen returns as intended, otherwise take a probe and place it at the site of the tear and move the abdomen and make two tears in the inner part of the abdomen and let the edges of the tears be from the corners of the cuts that you have made until they meet to form a corner. Until it meets, its shape will be similar to this shape:.
And when it [the wound] meets, its shape will be similar to this Greek 'Lambda' sign, then the meat should be removed from around the edge that is below what lies above the navel, afterwards the parts will be joined with two stitches using a catgut thread, and it should be treated with the medicines mentioned earlier until it heals.
And if the scar is flat or stitched, or anything else, it should be flattened simply without the hairs of the scar tissue that follows, then the edges should be separated by a lancet according to what was mentioned earlier.
The statement regarding the treatment of a scar whether it is on top or bottom, the work should be done according to what suits its nature as it can vary greatly in appearance. The physician must consider the specific situation with any possible approach.
Until the shape returns to its natural state or approximates it, and the patient guides you as to what work and tool suits him best in most cases.
Fifth Chapter.
On the suturing of an eyelid with a fine needle or with a suture of ligatures.
This incision may appear to many people as if the upper eyelid is being sutured with white of the eye, preventing it from easy movement and causing impairment in its natural functions. It should be noted that one should enter from the side of the nose under the eyelid.
Lift it up or stretch it with a probe, then cut the attachment gently without causing severity in cutting the attachments but only slightly so as not to disturb the surrounding tissues. The incision should be made such that if you were to pull on it, it would injure the eye only slightly, and your cut should be similar to pinching that attachment.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the attachment is completely separated, then irrigate it with a saline solution or squeeze it gently to express any pus that may be present. Afterward, separate the eyelid from the eye with a cotton swab soaked in water, then use a probe or narrow instrument to gently break up and remove any adherent tissue between the eyelid and the eye.
Place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white on top of the eye, and after three days use the plastered poultices until it is healed.
The Sixth Chapter.
On cutting the trichiasis (in-turned eyelashes) and removing the cornea.
The incision will be made with blows, either it becomes a cavity similar to a sharp and fine steel needle, or it does not become a cavity when iron is struck or taken by force it breaks apart.
When no forceps is found, both types of incisions begin from the largest vein and continue little by little until it covers the viewer and prevents light and eye movement. The approach for cutting should place the assistant's head on a stone.
Then he opens his eyes and lifts the eyelid with your hand, then seizes the incision with small forceps and pushes it upward, then takes a needle and places a hair from the horse or cow and a strong thread in it, slightly tightens the end of the needle and pierces it in the center of the incision.
And pierce it with the needle and tie the incision with the thread, pull it upward and tighten the hair along the edge of the incision as if spreading it to its end, then cut the rest in the center of the vein with a sharp knife or small scissors, and leave the natural tissue of the vein.
To prevent the permanent loss of an eye due to a laceration of the tear duct, the wound shall be sutured with a needle or thread as previously mentioned, then it should be drained using a blunt-tipped probe as shown here.
To prevent the eye from being blinded by a bandage, if it becomes infected causing swelling, first cut the swollen part and then pour into the eye either common salt or crushed glass and leave it there for a day before treating it as necessary to save it.
If the wound is not deep and cannot be sewn up or held shut with a suture, this type of wound is often treated with medication to save it, as described in the previous section. If you wish to cut it, open the eyelid of the injured eye.
Take a soft, blunt-tipped probe and gently place it on this illustration:. Loosen the wound gently with a soft probe, if you see it breaking and swelling, and causing pain in it, squeeze for a minute from the eye juice of crushed glass or red medicine or common salt and hold the eye shut for another day.
Then, complete the work on it until all of it goes away, except if you are resistant in the eye and a hot abscess forms; leave it alone and treat the hot abscess until it opens. After that, continue the work on it with cauterization until it opens. As for a cyst in the flesh, when it is cut open, remove its contents, then fill it with hot oil or vinegar, and apply heat to it so that it opens up.
If the cyst causes harm to the eye severely, tie it with a thread and cut off a part of it carefully without causing bleeding. Then, press it on red or ointment-like antimony until it opens.
Chapter Seven-Ten.
On the excision of pterygium and excessive growth in the eye.
In some people, red, stacked flesh may grow in the eye and cover the view or approach it, or it may protrude towards the lashes, resembling a pterygium of the finger.
The procedure is to make the patient hold his head in a vise, then open his eye wide and remove all the red flesh with forceps that are suitable for this purpose.
Or hold him in place or tie him up, then cut the first piece of flesh and continue cutting until it is all removed by cuts, taking care not to injure the eye during the procedure. Your tool for this may be a lever (as described in the excision of a tumor), or small forceps. When the pulse is touched, its image appears in the following chapter.
If your wound is cut and all the worms have come out, fill the eye with sharp salt or drop in it red powder from edible medicines and place on the outside a white lint to prevent the hot worm.
If there remains something of the worms and your blood prevails and you fear the hot worm, leave the eye and treat it with what cures worms, then wait for it to heal. Similarly, make from excess meat that is used in the eye of this kind.
Do not treat weak eyes by staining or exposing them to work with iron and do not touch anything of this kind of work until you see that the limb is suitable for such treatment.
Chapter Eighteen.
On palpating the pulse from the eye.
When the pulse is palpated on the eye, it reddens and weakens the sight of the eye over a period of days. Therefore, first look to see if the eye in which the pulse was found is strong and has no other disease except for the pulse.
Here it is that the incision should be done, instruct the patient to place his head on your stone, then tie those veins with one or two ligatures according to your preference and let the ligatures be gentle on this image.
Or let the ligatures be two pairs in one body on this image.
Then seize those veins gently with a probe and wipe the blood as soon as it flows out until you see the eye appear from it, and let those veins go out, and let the blood flow, but do not harm the eye by the sides of the probe, and let your work be at midday facing the sun.
And be very careful in your work so as not to cut anything other than those veins, when you find a gap, squeeze in the green or red channels to eat up what remains of the wound, for if it is not possible for you to seize all of it in that hour, then close the eye with what relieves the pain.
Leave it for days until the pain subsides and the hot worm is cured, then return to work on it in this way, observing its state with your eye, until this probe-like shape escapes from it.
Leave it (the instrument) [with the point of the cautery in the student's flesh, and it will dry up the tear and make a hole at the front and back of the eye and in its center] The principle in the work is to open the eye with incisions that are firm or triangular, holding them.
Pierce and make the point of the cautery in the student's flesh, let it dry up the tear and make a hole at the front and back of the eye and in its center; choose to start either from above or below the eye, but first to dry up two channels in the upper eyelid, one at the end of the instrument and the other at the beginning.
Hold it between the two (points) then bind small stitches beneath them, then hold it between the inner and outer canthus and move your hand gently so you can see all the paths raised; cut from the lower side if there is a hole made by a probe or cut with a thin blade.
Make the incision around the eyelashes and trace all the paths until they rise above the flesh, but do not cut the tear duct or blood vessels; if the tear dries up, it will fill with fluid.
Then cut with the probe from above and below so that there remains only the canal in the eyelid, for if you can raise it from above the eyelid, it is better; in some cases it may heal by itself.
If it is cut, it becomes festering for days where its ulcer resides and when the hot worm dwells in it, then repeat the operation on it.
The ninth chapter.
On returning the boil to the nostril.
The boil is called Naṣūr, if it is treated with cautery or a burning medicine according to its description and it does not dissipate, there is no hope in it except that it breaks open upon the worm exiting and all the moisture or pus inside it is drained.
Until the bone appears, if the bone appears and you see in it decay or blackness, push it out with this instrument whose figure is as follows:.
The instrument for pushing out decay from the bone is made of Indian iron and has a rounded head like a casket, with etchings of the mangle or the ice pick, fine engravings. It is placed on the site of the decay in the bone, then rotated between your fingers until you know that the decay has been pushed out.
This is done several times, then the site is compressed with drying medicines. If the site closes and flesh grows over it and the wound heals, a period of time passes and forty days have elapsed without it recurring or causing any incident.
Know that if it [the instrument] has been cleaned, otherwise it has no use except for the Nasur's method for returning to the nostril on this condition: to uncover the second bone with iron or sharp drug. If the bone is uncovered, take a forceps on this image.
The tip of the forceps should be triangular and its shaft conical and bent towards the tip as you can see, then place it on the bone close to the muzzle and slightly away from the eye, then apply pressure with your hand until the bone is pushed out and you feel the obstruction.
If air escapes from the nostril when you hold your hand over it, then force the situation with tight and dry medication as you know. If the flesh swells and the area becomes hard, the substance that was pushed out will return to the nostril. This is a sign of relief if Allah wills it.
The Tenth Chapter.
Returning the Nasal Bone.
If the eye is completely dislocated and there is no apparent damage to vision, it is necessary to relieve the obstruction, then separate it in the nasal cavity, then place a tampon in the nasal passage without pressure, and gently feel for the obstruction.
Then, place a pessary made of lead, antimony, white bismuth and azarbit (or pitch) on the eye. Afterwards, push the eye from above with a forceps abundantly coated with ointment. The recipe for the ointment is to take much powdered quicksilver. Each portion of this quicksilver is applied to four small poultices made numerous times over.
Then, place one on the other as needed for the eye, then press it firmly and tightly with a forceps without any hesitation. Afterwards, remove the forceps and leave the eye stitched up for a day or two.
If the eye does not return, then repeat the stitching, ointment application, forceps and lead pessary until it returns.
The Title is "The Tenth Chapter.
"On the Treatment of Anemia
"If it shows as a red spot on the anus, like a piles, and the appearance of man is spoiled by it, and you wish to cut it, then perform surgery according to what was prescribed.
"First, insert a probe into the anus from below to above, then insert another probe with a thread attached on one side and draw it out, leaving the first probe in place.
Then cut the location of the stitch's knot, tie it with some cotton around the eyelid and squeeze gently, then extract the eyelid and place a bandage soaked in egg white on the eye until the thread comes out along with the cotton, then treat the eye as needed.
Then press the cotton from all sides with a small ring until the eye swells gently, then tie a thin thread that reaches to the corner of the eye so that the moisture drains, let the eye drop and apply it on the location, then squeeze until it heals.
The second chapter is number 40.
In the treatment of abscesses.
This abscess, which is called an abscess, is a cavity that resembles liquid water but is not, and the method of dealing with it is to make the patient sit on a raised chair, then take his head in both hands.
And move him until you see the cavity go down below your eyes, then stabilize and do not release, let the light appear and let the patient see things as he used to see them, if it does not go down below the eyes, we know that it is water, if it does not descend due to what we have mentioned.
"Unless otherwise, sit the patient between your hands, then grab a sharp scalpel and make an incision slightly above the callus on the affected area in the ingrown nail until the material comes out.
"When the material comes out, warm water mixed with honey or warmed milk and honey is applied to it, then treated with other treatments until it heals.
"The third and fortieth chapter.
"We have mentioned the types of water and which one is suitable for discharge in a clear, understandable language, so take it from there when it is healthy. At this point, the patient should sit between your hands facing the light as close to the sun.
"Connect the healthy eye and tighten it well, then raise the eyelid of the affected eye with your left hand if it is the left eye or your right hand if it is the right eye.
"Then place the edge of the discharge near the affected area with a pointed instrument in the same color as the eye, from the smaller eyelid angle, and push it forcefully while you guide it with your hand until it enters the eye and you feel that it has reached something empty.
It is required that the forceps should reach the depth equal to the distance from the edge of the eyelid to the back of the eyeball, which is the cornea. The copper will be visible within sight, and the eye will appear cloudy with a horny covering. Then the forceps should be raised to the position where there is water.
Then press it down several times until the water comes out of its place. If the oil rises from below, it means what is opened in front of his sight and the forceps are in the eye. Then wait a little, and if the water rises again without the forceps coming out, it is done.
If it remains still and does not rise, the forceps should be removed with its handle and you hold it slightly for a while then melt some clear iodized common salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then put on the outside of the eye either a patch or linen gauze.
Skin and white pus with a healthy eye attached, as for us and our people, we place the sharp cautery over it, if you are not forced to enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes. It is necessary to take the instrument called al-Brid, as shown in this figure:
Cut only the affected part with it and do not damage the surrounding tissue, for it is to touch the cautery at a gentle place then enter the cautery as we have mentioned before, when your work is complete, prepare the patient lying flat on a bed in a dimly lit room.
He is to be restrained from all movements and from shouting, his food should be something that agrees with his nature and he should not move his head to the right or left, the bandage should remain on him until the third day, then it is to be loosened in that dimly lit room and his sight is to be tested.
Show him various objects, then reapply the bandage for seven days, it should not be done during the treatment or after the cautery has been applied but before, to prevent water from quickly rising with intense looking.
If a burning ulcer or boil appears, it is necessary to let the eye heal before the seventh day. This can be done by letting the boil settle until it fills up, then releasing it and covering the face with bandages that press on the eyes from below for several days while in the dark room.
He should leave the house gradually and find out the cause of his illness, and be aware that looking is not beneficial for the learner in this case until he begins work. I have heard that some Iraqis said that they make a pouch in Iraq which absorbs water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make that and I have not read it in any of the ancient books, it may be a recent invention, and this is an image of some types of weapons for reference:.
Made of copper specifically, with this crescent shape on one side, the tip is triangular and sharp.
The fourth and fortieth section.
Treatment of necrotic flesh in the nose.
In the nose, necrotic flesh may appear in various forms, including something resembling numerous small scorpions with many legs, and it may be cancerous hard tissue similar to bone-like material, or it may be normal white flesh not like bone.
If the meat is not harmful or cancerous, place the affected area between your hands facing the sun, open the wound, let it receive the cautery, then draw it out from within. After that, cut what you have grasped with a fine sharp instrument from one side.
If the entire meat has gone, but something remains that cannot be cut, apply a sharp instrument gently until nothing remains of it except blood or bone heat.
If it is a harmful abscess, apply cupping until the blood stops flowing and all the meat has been cut away. Then, when the nose is cut open, let the fluid drain from the nostril into a container.
If it has healed, but the fluid has not discharged as required, then know that there is meat in the deeper parts of the broken bone that cannot be reached by the instrument. In this case, take a cord made of thick silk and pull it tightly on the affected area.
Wrap the affected area tightly with several cords, each one slightly looser than a finger width. Turn the edge of the cord to the inside of the nose and pull it gently so that it resembles a snuffbox. Draw out the pus until it reaches the skin.
The excerpt translates to: "He extracts on the tonsil and often the young do so in the book, which is an easy matter for whoever intends it, then the two edges of the thread, one that came out from the mouth and the other that remained in the nostril.
"Then, the application of meat (lard) on the thread that is in the cord until you learn that the flesh has been cut with the cord, then the cord comes out and remains in the nostril after removing the blood by a cotton swab, this procedure is done for three days or more in the Egyptian manner.
"Until the patient eats all that remains of the flesh, then something remains in the nose as a tube made of lead for some days until it comes out on its own, if he needs treatment, this procedure is used.
"This is the picture of the suction instrument that collects mucus and medicine in the nostril:
"Place a small candle-shaped copper or silver probe, open at the tips and handle in the same way.
"If you wish, make the tube closed like a bottle and the suction instrument open.
"It has a cork at the end as you see, which can be held when mucus or other fluids or waste matter come out of it.
Chapter Fifty and Tenth.
In the left nasal bone, on the side of the nose.
Often, tumors grow on the side of the nose. They increase in size and become visible with days until they obscure vision.
Therefore, it is advisable to cut it in its early appearance and remove all of it then apply either oil or the burning drug which acts as a substitute for oil, since if it is not completely cut, it may grow and harden like a bone with little sensation.
Do not expose it to iron, for it is a cancerous wound and often you will see the cutting of this tumor resulting in excessive bleeding from the person who has it. Even if the tumor is white and soft, it seems that the cutting can be done in all cases. Empty the cavity and cut it without hesitation or fear, then treat the area with what dries and constricts until it heals.
Chapter Six and Tenth.
In suturing of the nose, eye, and ear. If they separate due to injury or similar, know that when the connection separates in any of these areas, work on it is only beneficial for some people.
It is required that, when a wound is linear in his body, the ends of the wound are sewn together with stitching, then treated until it heals over. If the connection is broken and the wound splits, each crack becomes healthy individually, it is required to excise each crack with the tip of the skin until it burns.
Then, the wounds are sewn together with stitching and compressed, then various remedies such as powders of medicinal substances like lime or other smeared ointments are applied over them and left for two to three days before being unbandaged.
The medicine is changed and left until the stitches are cut from themselves, then treated with ointment until it heals over. The method of suturing can either be by thread as we have described in abdominal suturing or by sewing as you know here.
Chapter Seven and Forty.
On the extraction of the thorn that appears in the wounds.
Sometimes, many people may experience small, hard stone-like sand in their throats which resemble some of them to corns and others smaller or larger. It is required to tilt the throat and squeeze each grain, then attach it to a string.
Cut it from all sides, then fill the place after cutting with alum powder until the bleeding stops and it coagulates with honey, salt and treat the places with what can bind until the surgeries heal.
The eighth and fortieth chapter.
On the excision of excessive fat in the belly.
When excessive fat accumulates in the belly, it is called 'aulas.' It should be attached with a lasso or held with a hook and cut at its root, leaving the flesh to heal or bleed slightly. Then alum powder should be placed on the site.
Or one of the binding ointments can be used, for if that fat returns after treatment, it often recurs. Cut it again and cauterize it; it will not return after the cauterization.
The ninth and fortieth chapter.
On extracting teeth with iron.
There may be rough, unpleasant scales on the surface and inside the teeth between the gums which become blackened, whitened or hardened to such an extent that it reaches into the tooth and causes decay of the tooth and the loosening of the teeth for this reason.
It is necessary to hold the patient's head between your knees and pull out the tooth or teeth that have scales and sand-like substances on them until nothing remains, and likewise, you should do this with blackened, hardened or whitened teeth and anything similar until they are cleaned.
If the ulcer contains some of its border, it will return again after a few days, and another day and a third until it reaches the desired point. Know that the tooth requires various different types of drills according to what is suitable for your work.
The reason for drilling the tooth with the drill from inside and not from outside, as well as between the teeth, is different shapes. These are several types of drills that you should have at hand.
Section Thirty.
On Extraction of Teeth.
It is necessary to treat the tooth from its ailment in every way, and it is possible for it not to be extracted if it has no reason to be extracted because it is noble until it is necessary to extract it.
If the cause for extraction of the tooth is firm, then it should be stabilized until the tooth heals. Often, the cause for pain is mistaken as being in the healthy tooth and it is extracted. However, the pain does not go away until the sick tooth is extracted. We have observed this behavior frequently from barbers (non-professional dentists).
If the pain in your tooth is clear, then it should be bound with a ligature around it using some force until the pus is released from all sides. Then move it gently with your fingers or soft tweezers until it aches.
Then, when the two large dogs are enabled, enable yourself well and place the ulna of the limb between your thighs so that it is immobilized and does not move. Then, draw the fracture in alignment so as not to break it. If it does not come out, take one of those tools and insert it under it from all sides with a hammer and chisel, moving it as you did initially.
If the fracture is impacted or collapsed, it should be filled with splinters and tightly packed with fine-grained plaster so that it does not burst when you tighten it with splints. It is necessary to compress it from all sides with the plaster.
Preserve your effort so as not to break it, some of which will return to the ulna from there, that is greater than the initial pain. Do not make what the unskilled blacksmiths do in the joints and approach the fracture without using what we have described.
Many people experience severe injuries where the fracture breaks and all or some of its roots remain. If a bone of the jaw is fractured as we have seen many times, then it swells afterwards due to drinking or eating salt and vinegar. If bleeding occurs from the site, it often happens that this is caused by applying pressure to the wound. In such a case, squeeze something made of gauze and apply it to the site.
If the forceps does not help you, use the delicate picture of the forceps that move the tooth first. It should have long handles and a short grip that is sturdy so it doesn't slip off when applying pressure on the tooth. This is the picture of large forceps.
The handles should be sturdy until it doesn't slip off when applying pressure on the tooth and doesn't break, while having short handles. It should be made of Indian iron or strong brass with smooth edges. On one side, there should be prongs that can fit together to grasp firmly and securely.
The handles should be designed like a lever, making them also strong for gripping.
The first and thirty-first section.
On the extraction of roots and removal of broken teeth in jaws.
If a root remains after tooth extraction that has been broken, it is necessary to put cotton soaked in oil on the site for one or two days until the site heals, then a probe or forceps can be inserted. A forceps resembling the beak of a bird, known as the peluret, is this type of forceps.
If it has been made like a cauterizing iron or a probe, and if it does not come out, you should make an incision and expose all the flesh with the handle, then insert the instrument which resembles a small lancet, as depicted here:.
Short and slightly thick, not sharp so as not to break. If the handle comes out with this, otherwise use these other instruments depicted here, the first one is a trident with some thickness.
Another depiction of a trident:.
And we can also use this instrument with two prongs, as depicted here too:.
And among other instruments and spikes mentioned in the text on veins, we can also use this instrument resembling a large scissor, as depicted here:.
A curved trident with a little thickness but not sharp, so as not to break; it should not be sharp. Know also that instruments for veins are numerous and likewise other instruments cannot all be enumerated. The artisan himself may invent tools suitable for his work and the diseases he faces.
Since among the ailments, those for which no instruments are remembered differ in their types. If a bone is fractured from the jaw or any of the bones in the mouth, or if it is bruised, one should examine it in its place with whatever instrument suitable for that purpose among these tools and forceps mentioned in extracting the roots.
And we use this picture as a reference:.
There should be a little amount of pressure to stabilize the bone so that it does not move until it is extracted, and the location should be compressed with suitable medications. If the bone is bruised, it should be gently moved from its bruising and swelling until it is cleaned, then treated until it heals.
Chapter Two, Thirty.
On the extraction of superfluous roots on others.
If roots grow in an abnormal place, it is harmful and if this happens especially in women and the elderly, it is necessary to examine whether the tooth has grown behind another tooth.
If it cannot be extracted or cleaned, break it and if it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this tool which is depicted as follows:.
It resembles a small chisel and should be made of hard Indian steel with a very sharp edge. Cut it in many days for the strength of the bone, and let it not irritate any other bones. If it comes to us capable of being tempered, temper it in an Indian furnace; this is its form.
It should be made entirely of steel and its tip should be extremely sharp, similar to the iron that is used for arrows. Heat the bone slightly with it in many days, ensuring not to irritate the bone; when it falls off, let it heal and then temper it with some oil.
If a tooth has broken and is causing pain during speech, it should be heated until the fracture disappears and heals, causing no further pain or harm to the tongue or speech.
The Third and Thirtieth Chapter.
To fix movable teeth, use threads of silver or gold.
If stationary teeth become loose and move due to a blow or falling, and the patient cannot bite down on anything without it falling out; if treatment with binding medications does not help, the tooth will fall out.
The method involves tightening with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better because silver softens and deteriorates after days, while gold remains unchanged in that regard, neither subject to such issues. The thread should be moderate in thickness and firm enough to fit between the stitches.
The image of stitching is to take the thread and insert it between the correct teeth, then tighten the sides of the thread between the moving roots (one or more) until the stitch reaches the correct tooth from the other side.
Then return the stitch to the side it started from and tighten your grip gently so that the knot does not move, ensuring the knot is at the base of the roots to prevent slipping. Then cut the ends of the strong thread with scissors, gather them together and tie them tightly with a square knot, hiding them between the correct tooth and the moving tooth.
To prevent the loosening or breaking of the stitches, leave it as tightly knotted as possible. If it dissolves or breaks, re-tie it with another thread to ensure its longevity, and this is an image of teeth and their stitching in both correct and moving teeth, as you can see:.
A single or double tooth may loosen after falling from its place and becomes entangled as previously described, and it remains so. This is done by the builder of a canal, and he may carve bone from cattle bones to make the shape of a tooth and place it in the same position where the tooth has fallen out. He grinds as we have previously said, and it remains so; he enjoys this process.
The fourth and thirty-third section.
In the incision of the ligament that lies beneath the tongue to prevent speech.
This ligament that lies beneath the tongue may either be innate in a person or it may appear due to injury.
The work in this case is to open the mouth of the patient and raise his head, then cut the stiff ligament beneath the tongue using a sharp knife until the tongue is released from its attachment. If there are any difficulties or thickening due to injury, the tooth should be removed with a wedge so that the ligament stretches and breaks, allowing the ligament to loosen and detach.
And beware that the break is not in the depth of the meat, for if it is, a suture should be made there to expose the wound. Then it should be pressed due to cutting with warm water or oil and cold water, then place a silk thread under the tongue for the patient to hold every night.
If a second incision does not occur, and bleeding occurs, place dry powder on the spot. If blood prevails, apply a cupping glass suitable for that purpose. Then treat with various remedies until it heals up.
The Fifth and Thirtieth Chapter.
On the extraction of the abscess that appears beneath the tongue.
If a swelling resembling a small abscess occurs beneath the tongue, it prevents normal functioning of the tongue and may fill up the mouth. The treatment is to open the mouth of the patient facing the sun and observe the abscess from there.
If you see it like a drop of pus or dark, blackish-colored, do not expose yourself to it as it is cancerous. If it is somewhat whitish and moist, use the cautery on it gently and excise it from all sides.
If bleeding occurs during the operation, place dry powder on it until the bleeding stops, then resume the operation to extract it completely. It will then solidify with salt and lime.
Then treat with various remedies that are suitable for this until it heals up.
The Sixth and Thirtieth Chapter.
In treatment of a scrotal abscess.
In abscesses occurring in the scrotum, there may appear nodules resembling those that appear externally, known as 'the two scrotal tumors.' If treated according to what has been mentioned in the classification, they will not recur.
If the abscess is hard like lead, with slight tenderness, do not treat it with iron. If its color is red and its substance thick, do not treat it with iron also, fearing bleeding. Rather, leave it until it heals; either pack it or let it burst from itself.
If it is white in color, soft and its substance is yielding, this is what should be excised. Before operating, one must ensure that the abscess has settled and its heat has subsided completely or partially.
When the patient is seated on a chair facing the sun, and his head is placed on a stone, open his mouth, take an assistant between your hands, hold his tongue down with this instrument (as shown in Figure).
Make an instrument from silver or copper, thin like a scalpel. When you press it with this instrument on the abscess and reveal it to your eyes, point a lancet at the tumor and draw it towards the outside without pulling any surrounding tissues.
Then it is to be cut with this instrument, its shape resembling a malleable leather, except that both sides of it are softened, each of them with a very sharp Indian steel or Damascene iron blade.
If this instrument is not present, then it should be cut with a lancet of such shape.
It should be cut with a sharp edge on one side and blunt on the other, first cutting one stone, then cutting the other of this type in its kind, then after cutting, it should be washed with cold water or vinegar and water.
If there is bleeding from it, wash it with water that has been boiled and made acidic by adding rattan splinters, or with vinegar and water, or something similar from the astringents until the bleeding stops, then treat it until it heals. If ulcers other than these two stones appear in the wound, they should be treated as described for the treatment of the stones, whether they are one or more.
A woman had a sore that had appeared inside her wound, causing pain slightly less than moderate, and it seemed as if the wound was closing, but the woman was suffocating due to narrowing and could not eat or drink water.
The translation is: And it had almost reached the point of death, even if I lived for a couple more days, and the worm had risen from him up to my nostrils. Then I grabbed the forceps, thrust one into it (the nostril), extracted a piece of it (worm) that was healthy.
Then I cut it where I had reached it from the nostril, then I did that with the other nostril, opened its mouth and compressed its tongue, then grabbed the forceps within the worm, then cut a part of it, but only blood flowed out of it.
Then the woman departed and I started from her hour to drink water, then she was able to eat, but we did not cut off the worm repeatedly for a long time, and the worm remained behind what is cut off until it grew long with that.
Then it broke up and the worm was expelled from the vagina, stopping its growth, then I moved away from that place and did not know what Allah had done with her after that.
The Seventh and Thirtieth Chapter.
On Cutting the Worm of Women.
If it is called 'Anbat' when it appears in the vagina and becomes swollen, it is white and elongated, then it is called 'Umud' if it is thick at the bottom and winding, otherwise it is called 'Anbat'. If it is treated as described in the section on treatment, there will be no cure.
If the worm is hot, it has departed and is brittle, it should be cut. If there is no permanent gathering of it and it is not long, if it is red or colored or black, or if it has no sensation, it should be avoided to cut it.
If the parasite is white and long, it should be placed on the blister under the sun and pressed with a tool described previously, then pierced with a lancet in the bladder.
It should be attracted to below and cut it with one of the tools mentioned in cutting almonds, but do not cut more than is necessary as you would increase harm by sound and talk.
After cutting, use what was described in cutting almonds to treat it until it heals. If the blister separates from the cut, apply the leech without fear or hesitation, for the tip of the leech is sharp and serves as a medicine. Place the head of the parasite in the stone.
Then press the tool we mentioned, then take from the hot water you described in the chapter of leeches and boil a young, non-puffed eel in it. Make it neither too thick nor too thin and fill this instrument with it. Here is its picture:.
The side which you place the medicine should have a concavity similar to the size of a mortar pestle. Place the instrument with the medicine on the lesion itself and the patient lying on their side, so as not to cause pain from within the incision, lest something falls out from it into the incision and harms [the patient].
Then grasp the medicine with your hand and grind it onto the lesion for about half an hour until it turns black due to the medicine, or if you wish to take a poultice, moisten a piece of cloth in the medicine and apply the moistened cloth to the wound.
Enter the wound with the poultice in a tube from above until the poultice sticks to the lesion, repeat this process as necessary until you reach the desired thickness. Then leave it for three or four days, if it falls off, prepare the medicine again.
After the application of the poultice, wipe around it with a moistened cloth soaked in oil and then rub it with cold water. Externally treat with tweezers and internally with probes until it is healed. This type of treatment is less invasive and further from fear.
The lady ailments are also treated with gentleness and cutting. Balsam is used for treatment on this condition, taking juniper, zufa, scammony, soapwort, fig-tree leaves, and fumitory. All or some of them are gathered together in a container and buried in lime.
The plaster is prepared with a specific consistency of clay and placed in the center under the bandage. A hollow hole is made where the device, which is made of silver or copper, is placed on this condition.
The handler who has the pipes enters the patient's mouth until the vapor reaches the lady ailment through the tubes, making it expand as needed. Then repeat this procedure several times until it swells. Make sure to perform this treatment at the onset of the ailment.
It often increases the pain, and it is advisable to perform this only when there are signs of inflammation or a hot swelling. If you do not have this device, take a small stick and wrap a eggshell around it so as not to burn the patient's mouth.
Because the eggshell prevents the steam from burning the mouth and this is good for the treatment with safety.
Chapter Eighty-third.
In the removal of thorns and what may appear in the incision other than that.
Often, in the incision, bone or thorn or something other than that may appear. It is necessary to remove whatever is visible after applying pressure with the tongue-pressing instrument in the sun.
In order to clarify for you what is in the incision, and what has not appeared for you and you suspect there may be something in the incision, it is necessary to apply pressure on the suspected area before food enters its cavity, lest the thing appear with the pressure or the suspected area becomes swollen or ulcerated.
Or, take a dry piece of bread or take a piece from white sea sponge and tie it to a thread, then apply it [to the suspected area]. If it reaches the location of the thorn, quickly pull the thread which will remove the thorn several times.
Often, the thorn or bone may adhere to it and not come out, unless what has been mentioned does not occur. In such a case, use an iron instrument of this shape:.
Let the suspected area become a little tender and at its tip, make an opening through which the suspected object can enter with force. It will raise the head of the instrument above [the suspected area] and hold it in place to prevent injury, then push the bone or thorn, or the physician may insert his hand.
Introduction of the probe to her is better for him to know its location in relation to the foreign body, and it should either be pushed downwards or his hand with the instrument is attracted towards above. All of this is done according to his ability until it comes out.
The ninth and thirty-first chapter.
On the removal of a foreign body in an incision.
If a foreign body is treated with the methods we described for treatment with medications and it did not improve, then look at the probe incision in the direction of the sun after compressing its end with the instrument that was described for you.
If a foreign body comes under your sight, attract it with a small hook or gentle forceps, and if it does not respond to that, then take a straight tube and insert it into the probe incision near the foreign body. Then insert iron wire covered with fire into the tube.
Perform this several times and let the probe be held without water for a day. Then take an ice-filled syringe, open its mouth and blow into it gently so that no water droplets come out and move the water inside when he holds it by hand.
The foreign body will fall in its place if you feel it with water, and if it does not come out as described, burn the probe with fire and perform the procedures we have described for burning the lesion several times until it falls off.
The task in the boil is to take a cup in it, filled with burning sulfur and covered with a covering in its center with a hole. Then assemble the instrument in this hole, then receive the boil and place the applicator inside the tube, then close it so that the boil does not leak out until it knows that the boil has reached the incision.
The pus drops on the spot, if it does not drop except by repeated application of the boil and waiting for it to dry up and eating salt and garlic and drinking no water, it is necessary that it comes out with this arrangement, and this is a picture of an instrument that attracts the pus from the incision when placed on it.
It resembles a snare as you see, except that it has this perforation which enters the incision and its edge is like the beak of a bird in it, inside which there is a cold feeling if applied to something it does not leave.
Another instrument compresses the tongue, and it is a wide incision made of iron with a size equal to the mouth above the tongue, which enters the mouth standing on one side and leaves the mouth open unwillingly and cannot be closed by the teeth except when it is loosened.
Feature of the instrument that opens the mouth on this measurement with his own eye.
The fortieth section.
To make from speech in the auricle of the abscess and break it.
The types of abscesses are numerous and they differ according to what is mentioned about them in this book, and they vary in their cavities and breaking points from two aspects, one of which is the type of abscess within itself and without any accumulation of fluids.
The second type is determined by the locations where it occurs in the body because the abscess that happens in the head is not the same as the abscess that happens in a joint, and the abscess that happens in a muscle location is not the same as the abscess that happens in a tendon sheath. A judgment on each of them is made regarding treatment.
Among the abscesses, there are some that should not be drained except after pus has formed in them and they have matured, and there are those that should be drained because they have failed to mature, such as abscesses that are near joints.
Because if an abscess occurs near a joint, the process may take a long time for the surrounding tissues to subside. It might cause damage to the tendons or the joint itself. Therefore, it may prolong the duration of that limb or the abscess may be close to a head.
If you delay squeezing the abscess until it has fully matured, you will injure that part (of the body) or be near the seat of the disease; squeeze it gently and it is necessary to squeeze the worm only when it is not completely matured so as not to cause the pus to flow into the wound. It will become a nasal abscess.
It will become difficult to heal, and it is necessary to learn the appropriate time for squeezing abscesses, which have matured when the worm's pain has subsided, pus has decreased, the redness has faded, and there are signs of maturity such as the hardening of the abscess's head and other indicators.
It is necessary to squeeze it from a lower position than the abscess if possible, as it will be easier for the pus to flow out towards a lower position or at a more prominent site of the abscess and with a stronger flow; the squeezing should move along the length of the body if the abscesses are in the hands or feet.
Positions of the muscles, joints, veins, nerves, and all flat areas without a particular prominence; if there is a prominence, the squeezing should follow that position; if the worm is in a muscular area, it is better to leave the abscess alone.
Until the boil is ripe, as we mentioned before, if you squeeze it before that, the fat of the fish will be long and abundant in sinews and cartilage, and possibly harden its eyes and skin, and some abscesses may burst on the surface of the body when necessary or according to what the limb needs.
Use a single lance for small abscesses and a wider one or multiple incisions according to the size of the abscess, and it may be necessary that some abscesses should not be closed and cut if it has become like a carbuncle.
It has become like something exposed in many graves and tombs, and from it a pustule forms with three corners, and from it a piece breaks off like the skin of an ox, as the scurvy of Arabs does.
Use the pointed lance for that which does not have a head, like the boils that are flat and swollen, and it is necessary to use the incisive lance or similar types of incisions if it does not have a head like the pustules that are raised, and if the abscess is large and has been for a long time and has been squeezed, it should not be pressed as all the pus will come out at that time.
He extracted some of it (the pus), then the abscess hardened for a day, then he extracted some more pus as well. This procedure is repeated gradually until all is evacuated.
If the patient is weak, a woman in labor or a child, an elderly person or a lunatic, the animal soul often does not withdraw with the evacuation of pus. Therefore, the patient may die without you noticing. Be extremely careful about this matter.
After puncturing these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound and examine it, if the abscess is small or if the wound is simple, use a linen cloth or wool from the cotton plant. If the abscess is large and the wounds are numerous.
It is necessary to insert a linen cloth or wool into each wound until they connect, and if the abscess has cut off a part of the skin or surrounded it, it is necessary to pack it with cotton or hemp not soaked and let it harden for three days.
Then, it is removed and treated with the appropriate remedies until it heals, if you see blood oozing during your procedure, use cold water and clay after drinking a mixture of powdered cotton and hold it on the wound several times.
If the discharge persists, it is necessary to use management, treatment, and medications as described in numerous sections of our book and its divisions. If you are during the cold season and the site of the abscess is abundant with coldness, it is necessary to apply heat by means of hot drinks and oil.
Place it [the medication] on the site, and if you are during the summer and the sites are warm, it is necessary to carry the remedies cooled by water or drinks and oil, all of this cold until the third day as we mentioned, it is necessary that the abscess be resolved and cleaned.
Apply what cures it until it has healed, for this is what is required in the treatment of abscesses. As for the methods of detailing each abscess, we have mentioned a brief summary for every abscess, its path to healing detailed.
The first and forty-first chapter.
On the treatment of abscesses that appear on the skin of the head.
On the skin of the head, small abscesses appear, which are one of the types that contain pus, they have certain conditions similar to a chicken's wound, and there are many varieties of them, including shahmia (pus-filled), and others that contain moisture resembling cheese.
From it (the incision) comes part which contains moisture resembling pus and cheese and similar to that, and from it comes part which is hard and solid, all of it poses no danger in its breaking or extraction, as it does not cause pain when broken or extracted.
The work (on the incision) is to open it first with the instrument that resembles its shape, which is called a lancet, until one learns what it contains. If it contains moisture, then break it lengthwise in a simple long cut on this shape:.
Start cutting along line ~a-b~, if the moisture is released, break the cyst that contained it and cut it all off, leaving nothing of it behind, for it often returns if something remains from it.
Then bandage the wound with lint in salt water, if there is pus present, or in salty water and fill the wound with it, leave it for a later day, as it consumes what remains of the cyst, then apply a new layer of lint in salt water on it if necessary.
Keep checking to ensure that nothing remains of the cyst, when you are certain that it has all been removed, treat the wound with lint until it heals, and if there is an abscess present, break it on this shape:.
Crush the instruments, and let the cauteries be applied in the wounds of the eyes and break it from every side, then apply your effort to extract the foreign body as it may resist. If it stubbornly refuses, do what I have described for you later. The same applies if there is a tumor arising from the wound.
The treatment for the eye is as described, and crushing on a tumor that is arising from the wound is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings in the head may not have pus with them, and this occurs when crushing has been applied to a tumor.
A hard, white stone-like tumor on the head of an old woman was unable to be crushed, even when struck. Such swellings are not found in other places except on the heads of children.
When the ears are blocked, crush them all gently and make an incision from below to facilitate the flow of the fluid, then treat it according to its treatment.
Chapter Two, Forty.
Swellings appearing on the neck of monkeys occur frequently; however, these swellings do not appear only in the neck and under the armpits, but they may also appear all over the body. The one that occurs on the neck is usually single, while there are many of them that can be found. Some of them may produce offspring from each other.
Every pig has a particular enclosure within it, as is the case with livestock and head ulcers as we have described, and there are various types of pigs, some are hard and others contain moisture and some are bad and unresponsive to treatment.
If you have found any of them to be in good condition upon touch, its appearance is close to the color of skin and moves in all directions without being fixed at the neck or having a wart, ulcer, sore or itching, nor does it change. It is necessary to incise it gently from top to bottom of the body in this manner, following line -j- until line -b-.
Incise it from all sides and roll the skin with a ring or two rings or several rings as necessary, as we have mentioned in head ulcers, and extract it little by little so that it remains on the neck neither severing arteries nor veins, and let the wound not be deep.
Avoid excessive cutting or causing distress, cut only what is necessary, for if you sever arteries or veins and your hand slips from the operation, put it in a wound filled with ground glass or some of the substances that stop bleeding.
"Make the incision and leave it until the wound abscess settles and the wound heals and begins to shrink. If at that point, the blood stops flowing, return to your work when you are able, then examine the cavity with your little finger if there remains any. If small maggots remain, cut them out and clean them.
"If within the maggots there is a large blood vessel, it should not be cut from its source, but rather tied with strong and clean thread and left until it falls out naturally without causing harm. Then the wound is packed with cotton soaked in Egyptian myrrh and treated.
"If all the maggots are cut, it should be necessary to gather the wound edges and suture them after it is known that no residue of pus remains. If you see that a piece of maggot has remained with the bone, treat it as separate.
"It is necessary to make a deep and clean cut, use suturing and what we mentioned earlier, and if any maggots are wet, wrap them in simple gauze where the swelling can be seen, as we previously described.
Then, after the wound of the laceration, use the Egyptian cataplasms or similar to eat away the remaining corruption until you see the wound has been cleaned. If this is the case, treat it with compresses made from boiled meat until it heals.
The Third and Forty-Fourth Chapter.
In the fracture of a jaw bone that occurs within the socket.
Those at the beginning of this fracture in the jaw bone, I have not seen anyone among us make it, and this is their talk. As for those who perform animal slaughtering, it is necessary that they avoid a fracture in the jaw bone because they do not benefit from it.
So that all the roots and the tooth socket are clean, and for those who have a hot wound in the mouth or the jaw or molars if there is no problem in the teeth, it is necessary to perform a fracture of the jaw bone to escape from the pain which comes from swelling.
If we wish to do that (fracture of the jaw bone), it is necessary to perform a fracture under three circles of tooth sockets or four small fractures in the length between two circles, in such a way that the fracture is in the socket and not in the gums, and this position is suitable for the fracture.
Since it is devoid of flesh and distant from the artery, if the patient is a jugular vein, it is necessary to incise the skin with a lancet, then burn the skin until it reaches the jugular bulb or finds anything in it.
Then, burn the lancet that we described, and use it to incise the jugular bulb from the swelling which comes out with what is being cut and from the interruption of the sound, leaving the wound open for a certain period of time. If the fear of the injury subsides, gather the edges of the wound from the skin.
Write it neatly and without haste, then use the medicine that will cause the flesh to heal. This is the end of this book, the interpretation of this sentence which we have recounted is: if they see that the obstacle has closed the incision of one of these veins that they have mentioned.
Close the obstacle towards death and they themselves are commanded to go to the incision of the stone, so that the obstacle dies at the site of the injury with some air, and submit to death. They were only commanded to leave the wound open until the illness is over and it becomes three days or nearly there.
Here they command the suturing of the wound and its treatment until it heals, and I myself have seen a servant take scissors, sending him to cut it for me. I cut with them some portion of the scalp, then called him to treat it. When I found it festering like a puncture wound, I discovered the injury.
I found blood that had come out from the wound flowing easily, so I became certain that no artery or vein was cut and only air was coming out of the wound. When I examined it, I made a laceration in the wound and treated it until it healed, and nothing was exposed to the servant except for a frown on his face.
After several days, it returned to its normal state, and from this point onwards, we say that the fracture of the jaw does not pose a risk.
The fourth and forty-fourth sections.
In the fracture of the tumor that appears in the jaw and is known as Philtrum of the jaw.
This tumor that is known as Philtrum of the jaw is a large tumor on the body color, and it is common in women and comes in two types.
Either it may be natural or acquired, for the natural one has no cure and the acquired one will have a similarity to some animal secretions or one like a tumor that arises from scrofula, and in its fracture there is danger. Iron rods should not be applied to it unless it is small and the sore has healed and been lanced with a scalpel, for it resembles an animal's flesh and is not connected to any vessels; then break it as you would break a bone. Extract it with the surrounding flesh if it is in a cavity, or if not, pull it all out, then treat the area as appropriate for treatment.
Fifth and Forty-Fourth Chapter
On Breaking Types of Bones.
Bones have many types, and all their kinds have been mentioned in the classification. Here we shall explain the difference between bones and fractures, for a fracture is a problem. I say that a fracture will be accompanied by heat, swelling, and feared wounds until it heals completely. A fracture is complete when swelling and heat disappear, but a bone does not have heat, swelling, or wounds, and it has a special covering like a small box, which is its unique container. It will be on the color of the body, and its beginning is like a splinter, and it becomes like a boil and either large or small.
It is of two types, either it is festering or it contains moisture and the colors of moisture are numerous as mentioned in division. If you intend to treat the ailment, first probe and examine it with the instrument called the munds (Munds) as its image appears in the following chapter.
The size of the abscess, then bring out the munds and observe what comes out due to it. If moisture comes out, its color is known, break it open in a simple manner as mentioned for other abscesses. If no moisture comes out due to the munds, know that it is festering.
Break it open in a slanted manner with this appearance, as you are aware, and secure it with bandages and cut the skin from all sides with a scalpel while saving it if possible along with the ailment.
If the abscess bursts during the operation and you cannot extract it correctly, there is often no choice but to cut it off piece by piece until nothing remains of it. If something remains, either little or much, the ailment tends to recur more in this case.
If the wound becomes infected and some of its exudate remains, incise it around the edge with sharp instruments that are cutting, apply on top what drives away heat and worms, treat it with all possible remedies until it heals. If the disease is severe, make an incision in it and treat it with what is a strong remedy.
If the pulse becomes receding, either beating or not, and there is bleeding, the situation should be dressed with powdered alum and left for a day or two until the wound heals and stops bleeding. Then return to cutting what remains of the lesion.

A large forceps (Burd) is made of steel with rounded corners to facilitate entry into abscesses, and these are the images of the forceps, called The Burd, and there are three types of them too, large, medium, and small, Large Forceps Image:.
Figure of Central Ligature: [This is a title in Arabic, which does not have a direct translation into English.]
Figure of Small Ligature: [Same as above]
Figure of Small Loop: It can be used to explore abscesses, surgeries, wounds and cavities containing bones or otherwise; it is made of a copper alloy such as brass or silver, but the best are those made of silver. [This is a description in Arabic, which does not have a direct translation into English.]
And loops can also be made of black lead, and they are used to probe abscesses that have swollen so as to relieve the pain with this swelling; there are three types of them: long, central, and short. [This is a description in Arabic, which does not have a direct translation into English.]
According to the size of each abscess, and according to the depth and width of it, Figure of Large Loop [This is a title in Arabic, which does not have a direct translation into English.] is made of black lead.

Image caption: Small incision.
Make the incision narrow with limited edges, but leave the other sides unlimited. This is done to avoid cutting nerves or vessels during removal of the lesion, and to minimize pain compared to the burning felt when removing a worm.
These are the images of the cauteries and there are three types of them, namely large, medium and small. Image of a large cautery:.
Make from copper an instrument resembling a forceps, which can be grasped with it; on one side, it should have a flat plate of two layers, at the end of which is a hidden blade resembling a bird's tongue, which runs in and out as desired.
The images of forceps that hide between the fingers when probing for earwigs, which do not hurt the patient, are of three types because one of them is large, medium, and small. Image of a large forceps:
Images of amputation instruments that cut arteries, and they are three types as there are large ones, medium ones and small ones, image of the large amputation.
These are made of copper or zinc, slightly longer than you see and tapered, they should be with you in large and small sizes to cut the arteries quickly when necessary and when no medicine is at hand.
But they should not be used for cutting arteries in every part of the body, rather, they are only used in muscular areas such as the leg, arm, fingers, and abdomen, and around similar muscular organs.
And they can be made into smaller tools resembling bone saws, as depicted in this image:.
It cuts arteries if blood leaks from a wound or during the cutting of veins, and they can be tapered as shown in this image:.
The seventh and forty-fourth chapter.
In the case of male abdomen.
A man who resembles a woman's thigh may swell in some people to the extent of resembling a woman's thigh, yet it remains unpleasant. For those who dislike this, it is necessary to squeeze (the affected area) with leeches in this manner.
A line from the beginning of a text segment to its end:. Then cut the flesh entirely, then fill the wound with medicinal oil, then sew up the wound with stitching and treat it until it heals. The thigh bone should be left downward and its flesh should be pulled back as is customary for women.
It is necessary to squeeze on its sides in two places, each resembling a leech-shaped form that connects to the other at their ends so that the larger one surrounds the smaller one in this manner:. From the edge ~b~ to the edge ~j~, then cut the skin that lies between the two squeezes and remove the flesh and use what we previously mentioned about stitching and ointments as needed until it heals.
If you do not cauterize a part that is necessary for you to amputate, either due to necessity or before bleeding occurs, it is required that the wound be closed with a ligature of cotton soaked in tannin, and left until it has consumed the remaining flesh; then it should be treated until it heals.
The Eighth and Forty-Seventh Chapter.
In the abscesses that are exposed to the anus.
These abscesses that are exposed to the anus belong to the type of hard and round, surrounded by a sac containing pus; if it does not contain pus, it is required to make an incision in the shape of a crescent.
From point B to point J; if all the contents of the abscess have drained in its time, close it with plain cotton and leave it for another day, then remove the cotton.
Treat with the appropriate ligation until it heals; if the abscess is of the type of a hard and round knot, make an incision as we have mentioned in the incision on the hard and round knots, when the wound is closed to the point that pus oozes out, use a kyphophorous plaster according to what was explained earlier.
Chapter Nine and Forty.
In the incision of the worm that appears before the anus or rectum and is called Anusarma.
If the anus is cut and the skin that covers it is torn, there will be much exposure of this kind of wound and a worm appears in it, and likewise, the rectum may be exposed to having wind and worms.
The signs by which it is known that the worm and wind are from before the anus or rectum, if the worm is from the anus, it will be long and gathered in the depth of the body, and when you expel the worm with your finger, you feel as if it has a bladder.
The one that is from the rectum, the worm will be wandering on the body's surface, and the incision on these abscesses is dangerous, especially in the belly, chest, and neck, and it was very severe in many parts of the body, so its treatment with iron should be avoided.
Also, it was not from there on the sides or head, so it should be avoided, for if it was gas from the anus, an incision was made in the skin with a long cut, then the incision was opened with scissors, and the anus was cut and removed from the stitches.
until it is revealed, then insert an incision and carry it to the opposite side and tighten the sutures with strong thread in two places on the sides of the wound, then sew up with a needle between the ligatures, until all the blood comes out.
until the pustule bursts, then apply the treatment that produces a purulent discharge until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
If the pustule was caused by a splinter in the skin, it is necessary to grab as much of the pustule along with the skin and then make an incision below the area that you grabbed and carry it through until it comes out from the opposite side and sew it up with strong thread. then tie the pustule tightly with a strong suture according to what you have learned about ligating an abscess from both sides of the thread, but if you fear that the stitches might break, insert another incision with a new thread under the entire pustule where the first incision ends.
Tighten the stitches in four places, then cut open the pustule in the middle until everything inside comes out and cut off any excess skin, leaving what was sutured, then place ointment that has been soaked in oil on it. Then apply treatment that is in the vein and artery until it bleeds.
Chapter 50.
On the worm that emerges from the bone.
As the worm appears in the ears and veins, similarly, the worm appears in the bone if it is hit or there is excessive fatigue or similar, and this occurs more in places of weakness such as joints and elbows.
In every place where there is movement, it is a worm that resembles the color of the body and is usually without pain. When pressed with great force, it feels like flesh (or muscle) but the worm is not gathered together in the depths of the body.
It is under the skin and moves in all directions without going forward or backward, so there should be no need to expose it with iron, as it may prolong time (healing). It should not be found in joints nor on the head or neck.
Make a small incision in the skin, if the worm is small grab it with forceps and cut it off at its root. If it is large, tie it with a ligature, cut it then remove it and close the wound with stitching until it bleeds.
Chapter One - Fifty-one.
In the section of cutting through arteries located in the abdomen.
Arteries called al-Futriyyah, similar to the vein (al-fatrah), are frequently found in the abdomen and other organs of some people. They have a slender base and a thick head, and can change into small vessels or become very large.
A man was observed with two growths in his abdomen, resembling the shapes of testicles but without any difference in color. His eyesight dimmed and they became swollen and leaked moisture constantly. I cut them both and weighed one around ten ounces and the other about six.
The work is to cut them, and if the cause is moist and the growths are white and soft at the core, then cut it with a broad knife and place the pieces in your hot coals so that much blood may gush out upon cutting.
If the bleeding persists, tie them with a wire of strong copper and leave it for a few days then tighten the wire again so that it does not loosen.
Every time a growth appears until it is cut and falls of its own accord, if the growth is hard at the core, then be careful when cutting it and do not hesitate, but know that it may not be in the abdomen, but rather in another part of the body. However, it can be partially or fully cut.
Then, cauterize to prevent recurrence, then treat until the wound heals completely. Be careful not to expose it to cutting through veins, as it will cause color change and dim sight, for it is a cancerous ulcer, and its mention of cancer will come later.
The second and fiftieth section.
In the treatment of anal warts.
Anal warts have many causes, either from the penetration of feces which exits from the rectum in other areas or from blood coming out of veins or arteries or from wind that inflames it.
If it is due to the penetration of feces and the exit of mucus, then the color of the wart will resemble that of the body and it will be pale without pain, and its appearance will vary. And if it is due to the exit of mucus, then its condition will vary greatly as described earlier. If you press it with your fingers, it may disappear temporarily and then return, often accompanied by itching and increased swelling upon entering the bathroom and extreme fatigue. If it is due to moisture, then it will be pale.
If you press it with your hand and it neither increases nor decreases in size, and if it was previously blood, then these are the signs of a tumor appearing black; but if it was previously meat, the tumor will be white and hard, remaining as such for a certain period.
If it was previously air, it appears clear upon pressing; work on this is to observe whether the secretion before it is blood from arteries or veins or air. In such a case, one should abstain from treatment as there is fear and danger, as you know in the chapter where I mentioned the tumors that occur due to arteries and veins.
If the secretion before it is pus or mucus, one should command the patient to hold himself and remain motionless for an extended period, then learn about the boundaries of the whole tumor. Then command him to lean back between your hands on its surface, then press with a broad hand around the tumor at the place you learned about the boundaries, then push the center of the tumor upwards with a large spoon, then bind the place of the press with strong thread or string, tightly and securely.
The suture of the ligature shall be tightened, then the middle of the abscess secured above the ligature will be opened and your thumb will enter it. If you find pus, the ligature will be loosened and the pus will be pushed inside the abdomen. If there is a wound, it will be closed with a suture.
Cut the protruding part, if it resists or bleeds, press on it and return to your work and take two strong threads, insert them into it. Threads will enter the incision made around the abscess, then tighten the abscess in four places using the threads.
If you wish to remove the thread and leave the area until the meat is healed and falls off by itself, or if it breaks and falls off, then treat it with what is necessary for healing until it is healed completely, if pus collects in the suture.
Or if there is moisture, it should be incised and the blood or moisture found in it should be drained, then treated with what heals the area.
Chapter Three and Fifty-Three.
Treatment of Cancer.
We have mentioned in the section of division, types of cancer and the way to treat them with medicines and warning against treatment with iron lest it cause harm, and we have mentioned cancer originating in the womb and warning against its treatment.
We have mentioned initially that when cancer is in a place where it can be entirely excised such as cancer in the arm or leg and similar limbs capable of removal, then it should be removed in its entirety. However, if it has progressed to a large extent, it is not advisable to approach it.
If I was unable to cure it, and no one before me has achieved it, and it reached that state, then work on it if we are able as previously mentioned, when it begins to ease the affliction, then proceed with it until it is in the veins full of pus.
Then the pus is set in a container that allows it to be worked on, then it is exposed to the cancer-eating substances that are suitable for it, and then it is encapsulated from all sides with the skin so as not to leave anything of its base. Leave the blood to flow and do not cut it quickly.
Apply pressure to the wounded area and extract all the coagulated blood with your hand or whatever tools you can, if resistance occurs in the operation, a large amount of blood will flow from cutting veins or arteries. Squeeze the artery until the blood stops flowing, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
The Fourth and Fiftieth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Fractures.
We have mentioned in the classification that there are various types of fractures and how water can gather, and signs for each type, as well as treatment with medicines. The one to be treated with iron is only the simple type (zqy) and no other type should be approached with iron; neither should the hollow type nor the cartilaginous type.
If that is the case, it means a battle, if you have treated this type of fracture with medicines and it did not work out, look carefully; if the cause is aging and weakness or if there is another disease other than the fracture like having a different illness.
Stretching or crushing and similar actions; if you find that the cause is not a disease other than the fracture, nor is it a child nor an old man, then perform the operation on it by locating the cause and standing between your hands. The servant presses his hand into the abdomen and forces the water downwards towards the vent. Then, he takes a curved hook on this figure:
He presses the hernia back towards the inguinal region and, with a thin, curved instrument (such as a hare's foot), he probes to see if it is a hernia from the side of the inguinal region.
The hernia should be pushed away from the navel by about three fingers below it, and if the hernia is due to liver disease, then the protrusion will be easy to push back with three fingers, but if it is due to an enlarged spleen, then the protrusion will be on the right side by about three fingers.
Moreover, the protrusion should not be on the side that the patient wishes to lie on, otherwise it may worsen by pushing the contents towards the weak position, then the skin is incised with a skin-cutter and the instrument is inserted into the protrusion and raised with the hand.
Grasp the hernia between skin and scrotum as if you are pinching it, and make an incision with the scalpel until the hernia reaches an empty place, which is the water place, then extract it and insert the instrument into the incision, this is its representation:
It is a resembling tube made of thin bamboo, which can be made from copper, brass or lead. It has a small hole at the bottom and three holes on its sides; two on one side and one on the other as you see.
The tip of it may be fitted with a stopper similar to the tip of a pen, as seen in this image.
On the upper end of the tube, there is a small slot. When the instrument reaches water, it will drain from the tube at a moderate rate so that you do not drain more than necessary in a given time. If you drain too much, the animal may die due to suffocation.
Or it may present with an obstruction close to death, but you should drain it according to its strength and what indicates this is the state of the animal in terms of its pulse and color. Then you remove the instrument and hold the water and this is because it holds the water for a certain period.
Due to the skin that blocks the hole in the needle that tells you to stop it on that state, then you return the instrument a day later if the animal appears likely for that.
Also from water, the vessel softens. This is done on certain days and you are vigilant about error until no more than the required amount remains in the water. If you hesitate with regards to the suspicious matter and leave something significant in the water, treat it by burying it in hot sand.
Much perspiration in the bath and exposure to the sun while enduring thirst, treating it with dried medicines until it subsides. He should be careful with the bladder and kidneys after removing the water as described previously.
The fifth and sixtieth section.
Treatment of children who are born with or have a non-opened urethra or the urethra is narrow or not in its proper place.
A child may come out of the mother's womb with an unopened urethra; it is necessary to make an incision immediately after birth.
With a very thin thread on this image:
Then, put thin wires made of lead in the incision and tie them up. Hold onto it for three or four days until he wants to urinate, at which point remove it carefully and replace it, and if you don't use lead, the urine that flows to the area may not stop flowing and close on its own.
If a wound is narrow, it should be treated with a probe repeatedly until it opens widely. As for those who have wounds not in their proper place, this happens when one of them is born with the wound at the end of the rectum and cannot evacuate feces.
Until the probe is lifted by hand above, and it has not been born before, the anus cannot reach the uterus in a stable manner. This is a very bad reason, and the method of work in this case is to draw the probe on its surface.
Then move the rectum with your left hand forcefully and press the tip of the probe with a sharp scalpel or pen-like hard object as if you are cutting something, so that it comes to resemble the rectum, and the wound appears in the middle as intended.
Keep in mind during your work to avoid bleeding, as it often occurs. For this, use something that stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.
The sixth and thirty-fifth section.
On the boil that appears in the bladder, rectum, vagina, ulceration and the adhesion of the bladder to the rectum.
This ailment frequently occurs in dissection and it is called netou for fleshy tumors, it can be good or bad, the good one should be tied with a delicate snare.
Cut it until everything is clean, then place a swaddling cloth dipped in Egyptian mummy resin on it, and treat it later with Nakhla resin until it heals. If the tumor is bad and colored with pus, potter's clay should be used after cutting and grinding it.
If the tumor is in an ulcer that has not healed, and some of the tumors are inside the ulcer and some are outside, it should be removed first from the inside, until it drains. Then treat it from the outside.
Since when you treat them together, the ulcer is not secure from bursting, and it may also occur in females and ulcers with blackness and decay. It should be cauterized all that has turned black or is decayed.
Then honey is applied to it afterwards with finely ground pearls and crocus, then treat it with all treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use potter's clay on this image:.
The catheter is beneficial in both cases, namely bleeding and injury, if it perforates. If the bladder is consumed [with something] and its sack goes out at a time when it should be inserted into the male's urethra, it is necessary that tubes made of lead are inserted to drain the urine from it; as for the bladder being sealed with a covering.
This sealing only occurs in someone whose bladder was sound and had not been punctured, and it may be caused by injury or disease. In such a case, it is necessary to pierce the covering with a cannula until the bandage loosens and the bladder is relieved from all sides.
If the sealing is difficult to distinguish from a stricture, it is necessary to remove something from both the bladder and the covering because the covering is delicate and may be pierced quickly. Then, one should separate the covering from the bladder with a thin cane that has been soaked in cold water to prevent it from adhering again.
Then, it is treated with an emetic until it emits [the obstruction].
Chapter Seven and a Half.
On the purification of infants and the treatment of errors that may occur to them.
The cautery is not just any tool used in surgeries; when used intentionally and specifically for children, it should be performed skillfully.
The easiest way to achieve safety is by remembering the initial cautery, as it was not used in their practices and we are the ones who acquired it.
By experimentation, we found that most craftsmen and barbers use the cleaner with the mousse and the stick, they use the flame and the rope with thread and the cutting with the dagger, and I have tried all these methods.
I did not find a better method than the cleaning with the stick and the rope with thread, because the cleaning with the mousse often burns the skin as the upper layer of the skin is cut off while leaving the lower layer.
I was forced to cut further and the pain did not subside, and cleaning with the flame does not guarantee cutting the edge of the incision as it may enter the wound, and regarding cleaning with the dagger, the skin would likely tear apart or spoil the work, or the child's skin was short by nature.
Often, such are born who do not require purification and you have seen that. As for purification by the probe (cautery) and ligature with thread, experience has proven it to be effective because the probe above is like the probe below.
When you amputate your hand with the two blades in synchrony at a single time, the ligature thread will resemble a partition for the tendons from all sides and there will be no error in the joint, and it is better to deceive the child first.
It is not uncommon for one who understands little that you bind the thread in an amputation and let him go to a later time, then make him happy and keep it secret from him, so that you can do this with him and he will accept it without reason, then stop him between your hands at shoulder height.
A person should not sit and hold the probe (cautery) in his lap or under his foot, for the child's eye should not see the cauterization nor anything of the instruments. Then your hand enters into the amputation and you inflate the tendon and pull it up until the joint comes out.
Then clean what accumulates in it of pus, then bind the place with strong thread, then below that bind a second thread slightly, then take hold with your forceps and the suture needle at the lower bond firmly and cut between the threads. Then lift the skin quickly and extract the abscess, then let a little blood flow, for it is best and least painful for an abscess. Then clean it with damp pumice, then sprinkle on it from dry burnt lime or sand of the mill, for it is better, or powdered chalk, for it is also good.

Then clean it with damp pumice, then sprinkle on it from dry burnt lime or sand of the mill, for it is better, or powdered chalk, for it is also good. Then place the abscesses on a pouch, and pack it with cooked egg whites boiled in water infused with barley flour, let it remain there for several days, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
And this is the image of the needle used for cleaning:.
The probe should be straight, without a bend, with a sharp point and the length of its blades equal. Be careful not to cut all or part of the skin when cutting, as it may cause inflammation at the site.
Cut it [the lesion] flat, if you are not able to grasp it with your forceps, then attract it with a hook and cut it. If three days have passed and it swells and becomes hot beneath the edge of the incision, leave it until the warm inflammation subsides and then cauterize it.
Cut it according to what suits you, and take care not to cut anything from the edge of the incision, for that does no harm. Treat it with whatever remedies we have described in our treatise on sores.
If you cut more than the necessary amount from the skin and draw it up, that too is not harmful to a great extent. Treat it as we have described until it heals.
The eighth and fifty-ninth chapter.
On the treatment of obstructed urine in the bladder.
Obstructed urine in the bladder is due to obstruction by stone, blood clot, pus or meat-like matter and similar things. If you treat it with what we have described for the side effects of treatment as mentioned in the classification.
If urine does not flow and you suspect that it is obstructed by a stone in the neck of the bladder, the patient should lie on his back, then a man should stand over him and press his abdomen against his chest while the patient holds himself.
When the stone is pressed at the neck of the bladder, it causes the stone to be expelled backwards and urine will flow. If it does not flow as described earlier and the condition worsens on the patient, extraction should be done with the instrument called Katharyr, here is its image:.
It is made from silver and is slender, shaped like a bird's beak in the end of a long tube, about the length of a span and a half. It has a soft handle at its head, and a drawing-up function for urine using threads, with a string or cord tightly tied to one end.
The end of the thread is inserted into the Katharyr and it is pulled gently if something comes out from the cord, so that it can enter the tube, then the Katharyr is lubricated with oil, ointment or egg white and the patient sits on a chair.
The bladder is uncovered and lubricated with wet cloth, oil or warm water, then the Katharyr is inserted into the uncovered part until it reaches the base of the instrument, then the instrument is pushed gently towards the inside.
Until the probe is completely inserted, push the forceps inside until it approaches the seat closely. The man inclines it downward and the forceps are within him, then push it until it reaches the stomach and he feels something empty.
The probe is positioned in this way because the channel through which urine flows has a bend, then the cord is threaded gently with some force, as urine follows the cord; it is then extracted and the urine released, and the forceps are returned.
Continue doing that until the stomach empties and the patient feels relieved.
The ninth chapter and fifty-ninth.
How to inflate the stomach with air.
Images of the devices suitable for inflating the stomach are made of brass or hardwood, with a long tube attached to a lockable valve. The water and medicine can be contained in it, which is referred to as the pump, and its image is shown below:.
Devices suitable for inflating the stomach are made of brass or hardwood, with a long tube attached to a valve in the shape of a plunger, all except one end, which is sealed with three holes on one side and one hole on the other side as shown below.
The hollow place where the [bladder] stones are located, to the extent they can be filled without more, until they attract some moisture; and if they push, they will expel to a distance as much as the force of the oil in naval battles at sea.
If you want to pour the liquids into the bladder, insert the tip of the catheter in the liquid and draw up the stone with it. The liquid will enter the hollow of the catheter. Then, introduce its end into the [urethra] according to what we have described in the story of the catheters, then push the liquid with the catheter.
Those liquids reach the bladder at that position until it is felt by the patient, and this is also a gentle method to inflate the bladder: (Here is an illustration of another method to inflate the bladder).
Make it from silver or lead, its upper part resembles a small feather and under that there is a ring where the cord is tied, then take a bladder bag and put the liquid you want to inflate the bladder with in it, then tie it tightly between the rings with strong thread.
Heat that liquid slightly on the fire, then insert the tip of the inflator into the [urethra], and press firmly on the bladder with the liquid until it is felt by the patient that the liquid has reached the bladder.
If mucus does not gather, take a piece of linen, make a circle out of it and pierce it all around. Then insert a string through the holes as it rotates. Gather the circle like a sack after placing inside it whatever moistening agents, ointments, or water you desire.
Then tie it in the instrument and use it as you would with mucus until moisture reaches the mucus.
Chapter Six.
On removing stones.
We have previously mentioned in the Anatomy section the types of stones and their treatment with drugs, and we distinguished between kidney stones and those in the bladder, as well as signs for identifying them. We also mentioned that some stones require surgical removal with fingers and forceps.
This is a stone produced specifically in the bladder, which appears as gravel and I shall describe it briefly and succinctly.
I say that the stone produced in the bladder is more likely to be subject to calculi, and among its signs is that urine comes out from the bladder resembling water in clumps.
It appears as gravel and he describes it well, he mentions that it is often accompanied by sand and frequently causes irritation. However, it can persist for up to ten years and becomes difficult in old age. For young people, it presents a moderate difficulty between the two extremes.
The one whose stone is larger has an easier treatment, and the smaller ones require more, so if we approach treatment, it is necessary to first drain the cause by draining all the pus that may be present in it as it may prevent detection of the stone during examination.
Then take the cause by its root and shake it downwards to let the stone fall into the bladder or push it from a higher place several times, then sit it between your hands with its head downward, hold it with your hand so that the bladder becomes all hollow towards the bottom, then examine it.
Examine it from outside, if you feel the stone in the cavity, then press it firmly, if it does not sink, tie a ligature to hold the bladder in place, then wipe the tip of the index finger of the left hand or the middle finger with oil if the cause is young or the index finger.
If it is a young one, place it in its position and examine the stone until it sinks under your finger, then move it gently towards the neck of the bladder, compress it with your finger and push it out in the direction you wish to crush it.
The attendant is ordered to press the bladder with his hand, and another attendant is ordered to push the testicles with his left hand towards above, while with his other hand he pushes the skin which is below the testicles on the side away from the location where the rupture will be. Then take the probe, as shown in this figure.
Crush the area between the bladder and the testicles not in the middle but on the left side of the scrotum, the rupture will be in the same bladder stone, grip it with your fingers and press it outwards so that the rupture is outside and wider from inside and tight on the bladder stone to the extent that the bladder stone can come out.
Do not press the finger too hard on the bladder stone during rupture as it may come out without difficulty, and know that some stones have edges and letters which make their removal difficult.
It is from this type of stone that looks like a ball and mobile, making its removal easy as it has no edges or letters. If not, increase the pressure slightly in rupture but if it does not come out in this way, it is necessary to compress it firmly with a flat forceps whose tip resembles a cold iron.
To press on the bladder so that it does not leak, or if you must enter beneath it with a delicate tool having a blunt tip. If you are unable to do so, widen the opening slightly. If something of blood emerges, cut it off with scissors.
If there are more than one, press the larger one towards the bladder first, then widen the opening on it. After that, remove the smaller one. Do this if there are more than two. If it is very large, be cautious as it may not be possible to widen the opening greatly because it could expose one of two risks.
Either it may lead to death or it may cause permanent urinary blockage because it cannot be moved from its position. Try to press and move it until it is expelled or it changes into a breakable state using forceps, until it is expelled in pieces.
Once you have completed your procedure, seal the wound with a candle and wait for it to cool. Then apply warm water or oil and wrap it with linen cloth, and let the heat remain until the worm dies. After that, apply pressure on the affected area and do not undo the bandage until the third day.
If a wound or ulcer swells, it should be washed with much water and oil. Then treat it with al-murham al-nukhuliy and al-murham al-basliqun until it abscesses. If it appears in the incision or abscess that is hot, inflamed, suppurating, and similar such as blood congealing in the bladder and preventing urination, this can be known by the exit of blood along with urine.
Place your finger in the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it leads to the corruption of the bladder and its destruction. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat it with whatever remedy is suitable until it abscesses.
It is recommended during all treatment periods to tie the veins and gather them together to keep the medicine that is applied on the area, for if the abscess is small and has settled in the urethra and blocked it preventing urination, treat it as I have described before it becomes ulcerated.
Often I have found this treatment effective against ulceration. It is to take a piece of steel wool and shape it into the form shown here:.
Like a right angled triangle with a sharp point on the base, then take a string and tie it around the urethra below the abscess so that it does not return to the bladder. Then insert the steel wool into the abscess until it reaches the abscess itself.
Apply the probe gently into the bladder with your hand, move it around little by little and you will feel a puncture. Then hold onto what remains of the bladder outside the scrotum, for it will shatter and come out along with the urine, and the pain will subside.
If this treatment does not work for you due to a blockage preventing it, tie a string under the bladder and another one above the bladder. Then squeeze the bladder within the scrotum between the strings and it will come out.
Then untie the string and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound. The string must be tied under the bladder so it does not return to the bladder, and the other one from above to ensure that when the string is untied after the bladder comes out, the skin will return to its place covering the wound.
To achieve this, if you tie the upper string, raise the skin above so it returns to its place when you release it and covers the wound as we said.
Chapter One and Two.
On removing the bladder in women.
Bladder stones are rarely found in women. If one is presented to you, it makes treating her difficult and many will refuse to allow a woman to be examined because she might not be a virgin, or they will not find a woman who allows herself to be treated.
If it is slim or from the forbidden women, or if you do not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially not to work with her hands and feet, the fourth point is that the fracture on the bone should be distant from the joint, thus requiring a different incision.
In this case, it is dangerous, so if necessity requires that, then it is necessary to take a competent female doctor or if she cannot be found, seek an expert male doctor, or bring a woman who is skilled in women's matters, or a woman who has some experience in this craft.
Bring her and instruct her to examine the bone first, as she should check if the woman is menstruating. In that case, it is necessary for her to insert her finger into the vagina and examine the bone. If she finds it and presses it under her fingernail.
Then instruct her to make the incision, as she should not be menstruating and if she is pregnant, then allow one who is skilled to insert her finger into the armpit and feel for the bone with her left hand while firmly rotating it.
If you find it (the tumor), it is necessary to lower it from the mouth of the stomach downwards by its depth until it reaches the bottom of the intestine, then break it open near the midpoint of the abdomen, at the root of the intestine, whichever side it comes from. Feel for the stone in that direction.
Press it (the tumor) to ensure that the stone is not pressed underneath, and make the opening small at first. Then introduce a tool into this small opening. If you feel for the stone, increase the opening as much as you know that the stone will come out. Know that there are various types of stones.
Among them are small and large, smooth and rough, long and rounded, and with hair. Know their types to determine what you want, for if blood overwhelms you, apply a coagulant powder in the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out, work with the tools mentioned in the male's extraction of stones, using them to assist you in your work. If bleeding overwhelms you and you realize it is dangerous, apply cautery to the area.
"After it has become firmly knit, leave it and do not try to open it again, and do not remove the suture. Perhaps the wound will heal. If a pus accumulates after days and the place relaxes, return to your work until the abscess is expelled.
"Second and sixth paragraph
"On the abscess on the water bladder.
"The water bladder is a collection of fluid under the tough white sac, which surrounds the testicle and is covered by a membrane called the scrotum, and it can be found in a specific location within the testicle.
"It should be noted that it is not another egg, but rather it is between the scrotum and the white sac we mentioned earlier, and this abscess does not occur except in the testicle. This abscess occurs due to a weakness that is susceptible to women, so this substance accumulates there after an injury to the testicle.
"This fluid may have various colors, either yellow, blood-red, brown, black, or white, and the signs that indicate it.
If water gathers, it is to be noted that if [it] is in the whitish scrotum (we have said earlier) the worm will grow little in length, resembling an egg, and its characteristic feature will not show because moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If moisture is in the scrotum (the whitish one) mentioned earlier, then the worm will grow little by little resembling an egg.
If a man supposes that it is another white egg, and moisture is between the scrotum and the whitish scrotum, then it occurs under the skin. As for if you want to know the color of the moisture, squeeze the worm with a warm dye which you have prepared and shown its image; whatever does not come out from the dye, judge it by what is inside it.
When treating with iron, it is necessary that the patient be ordered to withdraw if possible and you see his body trembling, then he lies on something slightly elevated and a large number of cuts are made beneath him, then you sit on his left side.
Order the servant to sit on his right side, lead him to one side of the scrotum and to the side of the abdomen, then take a wide-mouthed container and make an incision in the middle of the scrotum nearly up to the pain.
The incision should be made evenly parallel to the line that divides the skin of the scrotum in half until it reaches the white cord containing it, then it is cut and preserved from being further incised, and the cut should be made more on the side adjoining the testicle. The incision is then made as shallow as possible.
Next, fill the cord with water and widen it as much as possible and let all the water out, then separate the edges of the incision with scissors and raise the cord above and do not touch the surrounding skin, and cut the cord as much as you can, either in one piece or cutting it piece by piece.
Be careful not to cut the thin side, for if you do not make a shallow incision, the water will not escape. If the testicle protrudes from its skin during your procedure, stop cutting the cord and return it to its place, then sew up the skin of the scrotum.
Next, treat all other types of surgeries until the patient recovers. If the testicle is infected with a previous disease, it is necessary to tie off the vessels that fear bleeding, then cut the cord and remove the testicle, and treat it as previously described.
If water accumulates in both cavities, know that it is a double hernia. Break the other cavity with what was done in the first one, regardless of its position, even if you think the operation is one. Then, smear blood.
Enter the hernias with threads dipped in oil or tallow, let another thread come out that has been dipped in alcohol and vinegar, spread it on the hernia and the abdominal cavity, place a stuffed sack above the crack (refracture), and these are the remedies. Tie them from above with a ligature that has six sides in this shape:.
Then take two cracks, tie and sew them with the loose thread in this way and make the edges by stuffing or wet cloth and join all together with strong thread in a leather strap, one of its edges should be taken to the shoulder.
The second method is to take it towards the anus, and the two edges on the lower limbs and the remaining edges on the upper limbs, and gather all of them in a leather strap, this hernia remedy can also be made with iron instead of the hernia.
Take a thin needle-shaped cupping glass, break the skin with it at the boil; this is its cover until the white pus, containing water, is exposed. Then take another cup on this spot.
It resembles the Greek eye, then press it with the cupping glass and cover until all the moisture is expelled. Then move the cupping glass by the pincers and break the white layer, cut it as much as you can until you reach all of it, and save the pus without burning it.
This procedure is safe, distant from bleeding, and superior to lancing. If you find resistance in the lancing or at any time of heat or inflammation or bleeding or anything else, it is necessary to treat each instance with the remedy that suits it accordingly.
If the reason is a bladder stone and it does not withstand this procedure due to his skill, do not use the cupping glass on what I have described and it is if it proves healthy according to the evidence provided.
The water bladder should be made to sit on a high chair, then the inflammation should be cupped in its lower part with a wide probe and the cupping glass should be placed along the body, keeping the opening wide enough to let all the water out. Then place cloths and bind it.
Leave it [the wound] to close with the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If draining of the water occurs during your manipulation, this is because the white dressing obstructs in the mouth of the wound and prevents the drainage of the water.
When that happens, it is necessary to insert a eagle's beak or the instrument that extracts pus, which you have previously presented its image or increase the opening of the wound slightly.
Know that the water may return and accumulate after six weeks or approximately so, if it accumulates, press on its nature and the cause of the problem will disappear.
Chapter Three and Four.
In the incision on the cartilage and treatment of it.
Know that the incision on this cartilage is a dangerous procedure in most cases, so we leave it and its safety, and I remind the work in it and its types of inflammation.
I say that inflammation occurs frequently in the bodies in which the testicles are implanted, and this may be due to a hot secretion that is deposited on the testicles, or it may be due to a blow, and its color is the same as the body's and there is no water.
The worm is white and sometimes the worm is swollen, its color like lead and it has no sensation. It can be from swellings of the glands or from swelling of the abscesses, as may have been mentioned earlier. If it is not from swellings of the glands, then this is known as the agitation of the worm.
If you grasp it with your fingers and it does not expose the buttocks, and if it is from swelling of the abscess, then nothing will agitate from it when grasped by the fingers. This type may rot and affect other meat.
To cure the scrofula, first peel off the skin of the neck then push the white cheese upward and extract it from the white pus. Tie the veins and separate the pus from the surrounding meat. Cut the vein after it has been separated from all sides of the cheese, if the cheese has hardened with that specific meat.
It is necessary to extract and cut the cheese, and if there is any adhesion between the pus or between the veins, it is necessary to remove all of that adhesion and cut it completely.
If the muscle plant is in the location of the anastomosis, which is at the back, it should be cut completely and the eggs extracted as we have mentioned. If you perform the operation, cauterize the bleeding with heated wool or alcohol then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
The Fourth and Sixth Sections.
In the treatment of the Adhesion that is with a wound.
In the treatment of the hernia, which is a swelling similar to scrotums accompanied by a painful feeling and difficulty in moving, exercising, walking, and in its treatment, it is necessary to apply leeches near the site without delay.
But it is important to mention the procedure performed by the ancients, for I say that it is necessary to make the patient sit on a high chair, then push the testicles down and grab the scrotum skin with your fingers along with the ointment which is near the scrotum.
He should be held by a servant and pulled forcefully then he should be squeezed with a narrow, sharp leech made of the ointment until the ointment is exposed, then scratched from all sides as I have told you in the book of surgery, then stitched with thread in it.
Connect the intestines at their first locations where the dilatation appeared, and also connect them at their ends; then cut it in the middle, cutting vertically to the length of the body and remove what accumulated in it of putrid fluids.
Then, treat the gall bladder with treatment similar to other surgeries that are intended to have a duration for which pus can grow in it; this is acceptable because if dilatation occurs in all the bladders, then one of the ovaries must be removed along with the bladder lest the unborn egg perish. Before cutting the intestines, they need to be tied; otherwise, they will lose their function and be of no use.
The Fifth and Sixth Chapters.
On the treatment of a ruptured abscess.
This abscess has occurred due to a rupture that occurs in the extended fissure on the abdomen near the armpits of the stomach, and the pus flows from it to one of the ovaries.
This fissure may occur due to a rupture or its extension, and these two types can occur from various causes such as a blow or wound or coughing or lifting heavy objects and so on. Its sign is that if it occurs from the extension of the fissure, it occurs sporadically over a long period.
A boil does not occur, and the abscess becomes flat to a depth similar to that of a finger before the lancing of the cavity takes place, and it is indicated that if there is any discharge from the tip of the lance, it occurs at the beginning and a great pain is caused. The abscess will appear differently beneath the skin closely.
The abscess is released and goes out from the lance, and it may discharge pus, hence this type of abscess is called "pus-abscess" or "purulent abscess". It may be accompanied by a smell, and sometimes there is swelling where the pus is. In such cases, the cause (of the swelling) is present as well.
Because it causes a strong and continuous pain, without any doubt if lanced, and treatment for these types of conditions is risky. Therefore, caution must be taken to avoid such occurrences. The method of treatment is to order the person to push the abscess back into its place in case of return.
Then, he will lie down on his back between your hands and raise the arm. Then you shall pull the skin above the abscess upwards and split the entire skin layer with a length. Then, you shall sew (the split skin) with needles in the holes required for opening the abscess.
The ulcer shall be as large as can be extracted from it the egg, then the forceps beneath the cicatrix skin are crushed until the hard white scoop from every side is exposed. Then insert your thumb into the cavity to where the egg is.
Between the hard white scoop beneath the egg and the second forceps, with the latter pulling from behind the egg, then squeeze with the left hand towards the inside of the cicatrix skin while at the same time pushing the hard white scoop upwards by the right hand, raising the egg along with the forceps to the side of the ulcer.
The servant is ordered to push the egg upwards, and you pull the forceps which are behind it with as much force as possible. Check your thumb to make sure there is no soft tissue in the hard white scoop. If you find anything, push it into the abdomen below.
Then take a thread made of strong silk, ten threads thick, and insert it at the end of the forceps beneath the cicatrix skin which is towards the ulcer. Cut its sides as close to the thread as possible until there are four threads left. Then, some of them are assembled in a stack and are tied with a strong suture called the ligature that we mentioned is deeply embedded under the skin of the dog, then the edges of the threads are also tied tightly so that nothing from the surrounding tissues can reach it. Then, let not a hot abscess arise from that and tie a second suture outside the first one at a distance from it less than two fingers, and after these two sutures, remove the dog's ligament as much as the bone of the finger.
Then, let not a hot abscess arise from that and tie a second suture outside the first one at a distance from it less than two fingers, and after these two sutures, remove the dog's ligament as much as the bone of the finger. Then cut the rest completely and remove the yolk, then pierce the skin of the dog deeply to let out blood and pus as we described earlier, then use the sutured thread dipped in oil and place it in the wound and use the ligature that we mentioned.
The white dog's ligament that we mentioned after cutting it should be kept with caution from blood flow, as it often causes problems. Leave the ligature until it falls off naturally, if it tightens, soak it in hot water and hold it until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with all treatments for wounds until it heals.
The Sixth and Seventh Chapters.
In the treatment of the pulmonary ulcer, no one has ever dared to cure it with iron, and as mentioned earlier, it should be made as we have described in the treatment where the tubes are tied below the split.
Then it should be split in the middle and the abscess should be opened until the tubes fall out, and the wound should be treated according to what we have mentioned until it heals.
The Seventh and Eighth Chapters.
In the incision that occurs in the intestines.
If the incision in the intestines is exposed as we have mentioned, nothing from the feces should reach the women, and if it does, it will be easy to treat it and return at all times.
But if the time is prolonged, the incision in the scrotum may increase until the feces and pus appear in the incised part and it becomes exposed from the extension of the scrotal incision that occurs in the intestines as we have mentioned. This is because the scrotum elongates, then it becomes thin and ruptures, and feces are exposed, and its treatment with vinegar as we have described and mentioned.
The ailment treated with iron on this characteristic is that you press the affected area on its surface between your hands, then break open the warm wound by spreading it to the extent of three fingers, and then pierce the scalpels beneath the skin.
The white scalpel, which follows, should be uncovered and placed at the affected site of the scalp. Then press it to the required depth of the body, and tie the affected sites on either side of the scalpel with sutures and then interlace one of them with the other.
Then straighten the handle of the scalpel and neither cut it nor press it, nor apply any other treatment as you know in treating abscesses. Then treat it by surgical treatment.
If the sutures are cut, clean them and tighten the wound until it clots. For the scalpel will contract and not increase the bleeding.
The knife is best in this situation because it is closer to safety.
Chapter Eight and Nine.
In the suturing of a scarred skin.
Many people scar their skin unintentionally, not the flesh that lies beneath it and is unsightly. Therefore, whoever wishes to treat it should press the affected area on its surface.
The entire skin that has been grafted onto the thick skin should be cut, then the edges are to be joined together; if you prefer to sew it first, stitch the grafted skin with three or four threads and pierce through the thread, then cut what is between the stitches.
Then treat it with treatment for all surgeries until it heals and the stitches fall out.
The Ninth and Tenth Sections.
In Anesthesia.
It is forbidden in our religion to use anesthesia.
And for this reason, it was necessary not to mention it in my book, but only to mention it for two reasons: the first is that it should be known by physicians if asked about it and to know the treatment of anesthesia; the second is that we often need anesthesia from certain animals for our benefit.
As for camels, mules, cats and similar animals, I say that anesthesia is obtained by hitting it with a blow, either with the rod or with the knife and cut; the one who receives a blow with the rod has the procedure as follows: we sit the animal in hot water until its female parts swell and become sensitive.
Then grasp it with your hand until it softens and does not become apparent upon touch, and as for the incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and peel its skin with the left hand, then bind the ligatures and make a single incision on each ball (or testicle).
Until the testicles appear, cut them both after separating them and do not leave any of the ligaments except for the thin one that is on the urethra. This strike from incision is better than the one from traction.
Since the traction may leave something of the testicles, the animal is castrated in groups, then the wound is treated until it heals.
The Seventy Chapter.
On Castration Treatment.
The testicle may be in males in two types: one type appears on the surface above the scrotum, or under the skin between the testicles in a shape like that of a woman's breast with hair and it may discharge urine from the skin of the scrotum.
And in women, there is one type and it is above the navel like a boy's testicles that come out to the outside as if it were a man's penis and the two of them are like testicles, and treatment for the three types.
Two types of men and one type of women should have excessive fatty tissue removed until its effects are alleviated, then treated with surgical remedies until it heals. As for the second type of man who experiences testicular prolapse within the scrotal skin, there is no treatment or healing for this condition.
The First and Seventh Chapter.
On the excision of superfluous fat from female breasts.
The breast may become enlarged in proportion to its natural state until it swells and becomes unsightly, and in some women it may grow so large that it resembles a man's and spread out into the public area.
Hold the excessive breast tissue with your hand or a cloth, then cut it off without hesitation and avoid going too deep into the tissue to prevent bleeding.
Then treat the wound with surgical remedies until it heals, and as for the prolapsed uterus, it is a type of swollen tissue that fills the womb until it becomes enlarged.
And in some cases, it may protrude externally like a hernia. Therefore, it is called a hernia and should be treated the same way as breast tissue, cutting it off and healing the wound.
Chapter Two, Sixty-Seven.
Treatment of Abscesses.
Abscess is defined as a swelling that is not opened, or if it is opened, it is small. It can either be natural, born with it, or acquired. The acquired one is due to an illness that may have occurred previously and can be from putrefied flesh.
An abscess is either a small pimple or swollen and can be in the depth of flesh, at its sides, above or below it, preventing union, ligature, childbirth, and possibly miscarriage. Knowing this is through observation of the susceptible.
If the abscess is visible and not close, then it should be probed with fingers or a probe. If the abscess is small and near the incision, then it should be opened as if to drain pus, then place your thumbs on the incision.
A woman, on her back, with a rupture in her side; then the scalpels are pushed forcefully until they pierce the thin membrane and open the wound; then take a piece of cotton wool, soak it in oil, place it on the spot, and let the woman gather all parts daily to prevent the wound from healing again.
If the wound is thick and wide, it should be incised with a thin sharp blade similar to a reed; if the wound is from flesh, it should be sutured with needles and cut, and keep medicines such as onions, leeks, garlic, and salt mixed with white egg yolk.
Then, tubes made of lead and wide should be used so that the wound does not heal quickly; they are to be held for several days, then a plaster made from dry poppy is applied, followed by other treatments until it heals. If in the abdomen there grows any meaty plant, it should be cut off with this characteristic.
If it was not a cancerous tumor, the cancerous tumor in the abdomen should not be treated with iron wire.
The third and seventy section.
In the treatment of abscesses, fistulas, and red boils that appear in women's wombs.
On abscesses: it is an inflammation of the abscesses' openings, causing continuous blood flow from it. If this condition persists, it becomes fistulas. Their types and symptoms were mentioned earlier, as well as their treatment which will be discussed here.
Acceptable treatments and those unacceptable, so I say that abscesses and fistulas within the womb that cannot be felt do not accept iron treatment, and those found in the mouth of the womb can be felt, these are the ones to be treated.
It is necessary for the woman to enter a cold house, then the fistula is cut with a plier or a blunt tool and severed from its roots, then a puncturing instrument that stops blood flow from other sources is left on it.
Similar to garlic, onions, and other similar substances, then elevate her legs to the wall for an hour, then bathe her in cold water if bleeding persists, she should be seated in a hot oven filled with camel dung and pottery shards, then take roasted barley flour, mix it with honey and apply it.
Apply (this) to them on the back (of their heads); if blood flows out, then stop it, otherwise use a cauterizing iron and two forceps without any condition, then take cotton and dip it in the juice of the leeches or the juice of the viper's fat or the juice of the millipedes mixed with vinegar and apply it to the location.
If the worm settles, treat the location with a cautery until it heals. As for the red boil resembling a louse's head coarse to the sight, it is necessary to cut off whatever appears of it as mentioned in the book of remedies, then treat it until it heals.
The Fourth and Sixty-Seventh Section.
In the abscess that appears in the liver.
In the abdomen, various types of abscesses such as cancer, hard worm, cysts, boils, scabs, scratches, fistulas, wounds, and hot worm can appear; all these diseases and their signs have been explained in detail.
It is necessary to mention in this article the hot worm that appears in the abdomen; if it is one of the abscesses whose duration is as follows, it should be treated by cauterizing its cavity with iron, provided that the ulcer of the worm is at its beginning, sharp with blows and inflammation.
If it appears red when you apply heat to it, do not hurry with the suction and treat it with what soothes the inflammation until these symptoms settle. Then, at that point, it is advisable for the woman to sit on a chair with two seats and lean on her back.
Bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen and ensure that her feet are apart, make her arms to be underneath her buttocks and tie them with a bandage that fits properly.
Then the woman who is ready should sit on the right side and use the instrument that opens the womb, whose image comes later, and it is recommended to measure the depth of the woman's uterus before using this instrument so that what enters from the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
If the instrument causes injury, it means that the instrument is too deep. In this case, a probe should be placed on the opening of the uterus to prevent the entire instrument from entering the uterus deeply and ensure that the handle of the tool, which moves in the instrument, comes from the upper side.
Hold the instrument and let the assistant rotate the handle until the opening of the uterus is visible, if the membrane appears and you touch it with your hand and it feels soft, then it is necessary to grasp it around its neck with a long forceps and wait for it to empty completely.
It is necessary that in incision, it becomes a linear pus-filled wound, filled with lard oil or green oil containing some pressure. The linear pus should come out from the wound on the side of the muscle and appear on the skin and on the subcutaneous tissue. A clean wool thread soaked in water boiled by tailors should be applied to it.
Then, it is treated after two days with a liniment that is suitable for this purpose until it heals completely.
Wash the muscle and wound with water and vinegar, then with water that has been boiled in which the root of asafetida or long zedoary has been soaked. Then return to the liniment, for if the pus is discharging from within the muscle.
It is necessary to abstain from treating it with iron, but rather treat as we have mentioned in the section on incision.
The fifth and sixtieth chapter.
On the teaching of cautery: how to treat living anuses that have protruded in an unnatural shape.
It is essential for the cauterizers to first know the natural shape of childbirth, and among its signs is if a woman experiences contractions and exhales intensely with a groan and there is a noticeable bulge in her.
The childbirth will be speedy, therefore know that this birth shall be natural and the child will emerge from his head or still attached within him or hanging out of him secretly. If you notice these signs, it is necessary to press the abdomen in order for the child to come out quickly.
If it has descended on his head, the afterbirth (placenta) will descend with it and cleanse itself properly, and if this birth has not occurred, it is an unnatural one, condemned because the child may be born feet first and his hands before his head.
One hand or one foot may come out, or the head and a hand may come out, or it may be breech (coming out buttocks first), and perhaps it will turn towards his heels and similar forms of abnormalities. Therefore, those capable should be careful and gentle with all these matters and avoid mistakes.
I clearly indicate each of these forms and the best way to deal with them, if the child is born naturally on his head, it will cause pain in the woman and make her labor more difficult. If you find her strength weakened, sit her on a chair and order women to support her.
The uterus is treated with cooked honey and moistened ointments, then the patient is introduced between her fingers in a slight opening, causing it to crack or it is cracked by force until what is inside becomes dry and the woman's abdomen ripens until the child is born.
If the child does not come out, it is necessary to make the woman inhale honey mixed with oil of roses and then order her to expel and squeeze herself with a suppository and hold her hand and nose so that the child comes out from its head first. In case both hands of the child come out first, they should be gently pulled back.
If the child does not enter, position the woman on a stand with her legs raised above and then shake the stand on the ground so that the woman holds herself to prevent falling off. If the hands do not enter and the child dies, cut off both hands and draw out the rest of the child.
Or tie the hands with a rope and draw them out gently, the child comes out. If the child comes out on its legs, it is necessary to push it upwards slightly, then turn the child gently until it straightens, then take one of the legs and pull it gently.
If it [the fetus] comes out from the twins (ovaries), order it to be gently pulled and pressed with forceps, for it will come out. If it does not come out as described, and the pregnancy continues a little at a time until it assumes its natural shape, it will come out when it is pulled out smoothly. In this case, prevent everything that has been described.
From the injuries of the fallopian tubes and mammary glands, and of the shirj and the sagma being dissolved with a solution, strike everywhere in the abdomen forcefully, then press it and make her lie down, and lower her body, then sit her on a hot water bag until it reaches the anus.
If you see that she has no vagina, make a vaginal opening for her by an incision and let her bear the burden (of pregnancy). When the incision is held for an hour, sit her on a chair, press it, close her mouth and nose, and forcefully press her lower abdomen repeatedly. The fetus will come out from its fingers or toes within an hour.
If it comes out in this state, insert your fingers gently into the vagina and let the woman sit on her haunches, push her lower limbs downwards and she lies flat on a bed, covers herself with her hands, then press lightly on the abdomen several times. Then, extract what is beneath her feet (the fetus) until it is in a downward position. If the child does not come out, grasp both of her legs and move them forcefully. Then, press slightly above the vagina until the child ascends. Then, insert your hand and slowly massage the child.
The woman should be dilated until the embryo is expelled, the embryo's expulsion should be resisted by one of his hands. He should grasp it with the back of his hand and if she cannot do so, the woman must lie down and walk if she cannot walk then she will lie down.
The midwife should vigorously shake the woman's legs, then use the leech that has been described in the medical texts. If the placenta is expelled with the birth, she should sit her on a chair and treat her for any injuries and ensure the child is born naturally shaped. The woman should continue to dilate until the embryo is expelled.
The newborn should be born face up with its head towards the mother's chest. Those who are capable should grab the child's hand and gently turn it while smoothing it. When it is level, apply what we have described as oil and medical ointments.
Then, she should be made to move a little here and there. When she does this, she should sit on the chair and be told to lean towards the right side. Then, she should be dilated with forceps as the child will be born on its side. The child is expelled when it is born sideways.
If it descends into the amniotic cavity along with the membrane, then pierce the membrane with your finger until it releases from the moisture. If it adheres to the face or neck of the fetus, then cut it from behind so that it does not strangle and dies. Then push the fetus inside until it is in the correct position.
The woman should purge several times as it will make the delivery easy. Delivering twins or triplets is common, but know that twins often survive unless they are premature. As for fives, it is something unnatural and rarely do they survive infancy.
Encircle them (the twins) and even if multiple membranes surround, separate them with a forceps connected by a string enclosed within each one of them. Each twin will be born through a natural and easy delivery, but their birth will be complicated as described earlier.
If one of them experiences difficulty during delivery and becomes abnormal as described, treat it as we have described earlier to ensure a gentle and safe recovery for each individual case based on the available skills.
Describes what appears in the womb as tumors that fall, it may appear as one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or more than ten. I have confirmed that a woman dropped seven and another fifteen, all of them formed.
According to the wise and knowledgeable, all of this should be in the field of obstetrics as such events may occur unexpectedly and she should be prepared for it accordingly.
The sixth and seventieth section.
On extracting the dead fetus.
If the dead fetus is treated as described in the section on treatment, and it does not come out, and the situation requires manual intervention, then it is necessary to observe whether the woman is healthy and there is nothing from the symptoms that might cause harm to her, then it is necessary for the woman to lie down on her back.
Her head should be slightly lower and her legs raised, with a helper holding her from both sides or she can be tied to the bed so that her body does not move when delivering the fetus.
Then, he should wet the mouth of her womb with damp cloths and pads, as well as camphor and honey. He will then anoint his hand with these substances and enter her womb. He will then ask for a location where he can place the forceps to remove the fetus, at the appropriate positions.
If the fetus is presenting breech, it will descend upon the head and the scissors may fall into its eyes or ears, mouth, nostrils, throat, neck or under the skin, close to the wounds or under the nails, or beneath the armpits.
If it descends upon the feet, it will be found in the anus and the central wounds, and one should hold the scissors with the right hand and place it between the fingers of the left hand, then insert the hand along with it to find a scissor in one of the mentioned positions.
Until it reaches something empty, then another or a third scissor is held and its grip is placed beside the first one if the attraction is equal and does not lean towards any direction, then it should be moved steadily in all directions without being fixed on a single point, but rather moving to all sides.
Making the passage easier, as done with teeth during extraction, is important between this, and it should be ensured that the direction of movement is changed if gripped from a side. If certain areas are held, some fetuses may come out and the scissors will be moved to other positions.
She should slightly elevate this until the child comes out completely, if a hand comes out before it and cannot be pulled back due to its gripping, then it is necessary to make an incision in it, and draw it out until all of it is cut off.
It is necessary to perform this in the wrist or the neck, and similarly it is necessary to do it on the other hand and both legs. If the head of the child is large and its passage requires pressure during birth or if there is water accumulated in its head, then it is necessary to insert a curved instrument between the fingers.
Crush the head with it so that water comes out or press it with the machine called the forceps, which is depicted along with other machines in the chapter following this one.
Similarly, perform this if the child is of large size and its head is big. It is necessary to crush the skull or press it with forceps as previously mentioned, then the bones come out with calipers. If the head comes out and pressure is applied at birth, then crush it until the liquid contained in the chest is released.
If the chest does not join (fusion) and does not come out, then cut off what you can of it. If it is located at the bottom of the abdomen and has a membrane or there is pus in it, then press it until you expel the liquid from it.
If the fetus is on his feet, its extraction will be easy and it shall be directed towards the vagina of the womb. If it should press upon the abdomen or chest, it must be extracted by breaking open that part with force, using your hand to break it open, and piercing either the abdomen or chest until what is within is expelled.
If you extract the limbs and return the head, grasp it and make an opening for it. If there is an open vagina, insert your hand into the neck of the womb and pull the head towards the vagina with your fingers. Then insert a hook or hooks and pull it with them.
If the vagina of the womb is connected to a hot and narrow ulcer, it is not recommended to press on it. Instead, in such a case, use warm oil or water and sit in a warm bath to soften it.
If the fetus is on one side, it can be repositioned. If that is not possible, it should be divided and extracted. Do not leave any piece of the placenta inside the uterus. Once your treatment is complete, use the remedies for hot ulcers as mentioned earlier in the section about the womb.
If a discharge of blood appears, it should be submerged in coagulating water and the rest of the treatment applied. I have seen a woman who had tied (it) and the fetus died within her, then she tied it again.
Then the second fetus also died, and after a long time, she had a discharge and there was swelling in her examination and it inflated until it opened and made her emit a foul smell. She was called for treatment, and she was treated for a long time but the wound did not heal. So they placed some strong cauterizing irons on it.
A bone came out of the place, then she stayed for days and another bone came out. She was surprised by this because there was no bone in her abdomen. So she thought that they were bones from the dead fetus. She examined the wound and extracted many bones from the head of the fetus.
She did not stop following this until she extracted many bones from her and the woman was in good condition, and indeed she had lived like this for a long time emitting a mild foul smell, but I have come here to present this rare case.
For there is knowledge and benefit in it for the physician who attempts with his hand to treat it.
The Seventh Chapter and the Sixty-Seven [sections]
In it, images of the tools needed for extracting the fetus.
Image of a probe to open the uterine cervix:.
This tool, which is called a probe, should have probes on both sides of the wooden handles, except that this probe must be softer than the tool and it can either be made of ivory or boxwood and each wooden handle must fit in two finger holes.
And their shape is similar to a finger, and their length is half a cubit, and in the center of the wooden handles there are rods made of the same wood, which have been grooved into them. The length of these rods is between half a cubit to slightly more than that, and their width is similar to or slightly larger than two fingers.
These are the two that enter the vagina to open them for the purpose of managing the waters, an image of another machine similar to this is more gentle and less conspicuous:.
Make from ebony or boxwood in the shape of a calipers, except that it has handles on each side as you can see, the length of each handle is around the width and both handles are finger-widths wide. If you want to open the womb with it.
Sit the woman on a stool with her legs spread apart between her thighs, then insert these two handles gently into the vagina and hold onto the bottom part of the instrument between her feet. Then open the instrument with your hand as you would calipers, to whatever extent you desire opening the womb. Until you make the desired size, an image of another plug is mentioned in the earlier texts:.
Image of a device to expel the fetus:.
Image of forceps used to grasp the head of the fetus:.
It resembles a saw in that it has teeth on the sides as you can see, and it is made straight like calipers as shown in this image, with teeth like those of a saw that cut and pierce:.
Image of a cannula (or probe) also:
Image caption: Figure of a surgical instrument.
Figure of a surgical instrument with a slightly bent tip to avoid breaking during the pull of a fetus, two-edged figure.
Figure of wide-bladed forceps for cutting the fetus.
Each of these tools, as their types multiplied and the craftsman was quicker to produce them and raised in people's eyes for his skill, you should not neglect one of them, for it may be necessary for it.
Chapter Eighty Seven.
On the extraction of the cataract.
If the cataract is held after breathing, it is necessary to order the assistant to grasp her (the patient) and then to squeeze it with forceps and press your hand on her mouth and pull it out with this, otherwise grab a tool.
And drill a hole in the seal and place in it the open-mouthed forceps such as fudanj, sadab, shabt, babunj, silyakh, qantourioun, all of these or some of them, immerse them in water and bring them to fire then place a red tube on the hole of the seal and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
Hold it until the liquid reaches the abdominal cavity, then let it go as we have said before, for the pus will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, command the one who can do so to insert his left hand in warm oil or unguent.
Then insert it into the wound and search for the pus, if you find it grasp it gently and pull it out little by little until it comes out. If it is deeply attached in the abdominal cavity, insert your hand as we have described, then when you find the pus, attract it gently little by little towards the surface.
To prevent the abdomen from falling during strong pulling, it is advisable to move it gently towards both sides (right and left) and then gradually increase the amount of pulling. For when it responds in this manner, it will return and dislodge itself from the attachment. If there is a fistula in the abdomen, we have described the treatment as letting go and applying pressure and using cautery.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, then exert force on it again in pulling, but it is advisable to tie what comes out from it to the vagina, then cut it with a four-edged knife (cautery), for it will heal after several days.
If it softens and comes out, it shall only be so unless it hardens again; for then it will emit a foul smell towards the affected part and the head, causing pain. Therefore, it is necessary to use agreeable smoke.
Some ancient women have experimented with the smoke of herbs such as poppy and castor oil, an image of the machine which a woman uses to inhale this smoke during childbirth and similar situations:.
It is made of brass or iron, the thin end is placed in the opening and the wide end is heated with charcoal and the smoke is trapped inside until it goes out and a fresh one comes in.
The ninth chapter and seventy.
On the treatment of non-pierced hemorrhoids.
If many children are born and their hemorrhoids are not pierced, it can be treated by a thin needle; if the patient is unable to do this herself, she should tie it with a sharp cord while being careful not to touch the nerves.
Then, a wick soaked in alcohol and oil is placed on it, and it is treated with cautery until it scabs over. If one fears that it may break open again, a thin tube of brass can be inserted into the piercing for several days until the child wants to pass stool.
The contusion (bruise) of the sciatic nerve may also occur from injury or disease. It is necessary to dissipate that condition, then treat it as previously described.
The Chapter is Eighteen.
On the treatment of the veins that occur in the lower parts.
The veins that occur in the lower parts are strangled and swollen. This happens near the sciatic nerve from outside or within one of its sides, and the vein(s) may be single or multiple.
If that strangulation occurs, it is necessary to open it and allow fluid - white or darkish yellow - to flow out. This may be one of the veins leading to the anus (hemorrhoid) or the bladder, or not leading to any of those. The ones that do lead out are known for the pus and foul air released upon applying the cautery.
Or there may be no pus, and it may be one of the veins if it is leading to the bladder or the urethra (male urinary duct), or leading to the pubic bone or the penis, and what is known as a vein leading to the sciatic nerve is also included in this category without leading to the sciatic nerve itself.
"Insert your little finger into the nostril, then insert a thin probe made of copper or iron if there is no splinter in the nostril. If there is a splinter, insert a thin probe made of lead or hair from the horse's mane.
"Feel for the splinter or hair with your little finger. If you do not feel anything protruding from the wound, nor smell or pus as we have previously mentioned, then know that it is not penetrated and proceed to treatment.
"If the splinter has penetrated to the throat or the urinary tract, a sign is the passage of urine from it and its refusal to be treated with medication. As for when it has penetrated to the palm of the hand or to the wrist, a sign is the arrival of the probe at that location.
"If there is no bone splinter and the pain is in that area, with continuous bleeding from it and no treatment or medication helping, these are all cases where there is no protrusion of the splinter.
"The treatment of such cases is ineffective for those who ignorantly try to treat them, and as for the ones which are not penetrated or fixed, let it be cauterized with iron as I have described and as I have tried, by pressing the affected area between your hands on its surface.
The excerpt translates to: "He should bring out the needle upward, and insert his hand into the abdomen. Then, a copper or lead wire is to be introduced if it is in the nasal cavity, until he learns where the wire ends. If it feels like a seated object, then it is necessary for you to insert your little finger at the seated point.
"If you feel the wire in your little finger, it means that it has emerged by itself without pain, except if you feel a roughness or flesh between your finger and it. In this case, be certain that it has emerged. Do not tire yourself trying to pull it out if there is no pain as we said earlier.
"It is said that it may cause suffocation in some people when the nasal cavity is blocked. The treatment that can be beneficial for this is to apply a thin tube made of a material suitable for the size of the nostril, such as silk or linen, and insert it into the nostril until it reaches the seated point, then withdraw it twice or thrice.
"Until you are certain that all the excess and swollen tissues, resembling the feathers of a bird's quill, have burned. Then, treat it with an ointment made of oil and resin until the burnt tissues come out. Afterwards, apply a salve to heal it.
Unless he can extract it without causing more harm, a foreign body should not be left in the wound forever. If a splinter has entered into the bone that is seated, there will be thick tissue, either meat or cartilage, between them. If you see a pustule on the surface of the skin next to the splinter, break it open when the skin around the pustule first appears. Follow the incision with the splinter, which is in the pustule, until you reach the edge of the splinter where it exits and the splinter comes out and falls off. Then clean the congealed flesh that resembles bird feathers, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat the wound with caustic soda until it is healed. If bleeding persists and there is a gap between you and your work, cut off the excessive flesh. It is better to do so with fire or a sharp instrument, as boiling kills the excess flesh.
Cut the blood and remove the moisture, then treat with infused oil of roses or powdered charcoal in oil until the situation is resolved and the burned flesh comes out in the discharge. Then treat the wound immediately with hot cauterizing iron for tough meat.
The medication which contains a binding agent and cleans is such that if it swells, it has been purged and there will be no danger of recurrence. If the Naṣūr has reached deep into the wound and beyond the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the wound and explore with it.
If you feel a cord and there is a covering of membrane or flesh between you and it, and it is close to the opening, then work should not be done on it except by the method of hope and prayer. This is because one may use one of three approaches: either to tie it as we have mentioned before.
Either it may be untied, until it reaches its hole, so that a probe can be inserted for treatment close by, without causing the surrounding nerves to be cut, thus preventing the boil from bursting unintentionally. Then treat it as we have mentioned before, but there is a possibility of purge as we said earlier.
Either it may be removed and cut, after untying and drawing it near the wound as we have mentioned before, either by thread or with another sharp tool. Then clean all the pus-filled flesh in the wound until you can remove it by cutting.
Then, make an incision in the wound completely with the blade and the upper jaw until it is closed. The nasal opening will remain inside the socket. This method will be less painful for the patient, and the nose may be deformed on this characteristic.
If you insert the probe into the nose and it is next to the socket on the side of the body with skin and the edge of the socket, take a probe when this happens, pierced at its end like an awl in this manner:.
Place a thread loosely through five or more strands and then insert the probe into the nose with the thread until it reaches the cavity, if it is open in the socket from within close by.
Pull the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the socket and pulling the end of the thread out, gathering both ends together and tightening them, then leave it for a day or two until the string cuts through the flesh between the threads very firmly, causing those pieces of flesh to fall off. Then treat the wound until it heals and scabs over.
If the upper jaw is not open, insert it as far as possible without risk of injury to nerves, then proceed as previously described until it heals and scabs over.
Image of the Shokky incision which breaks the nerves, its perception is very sharp on one side and not sharp on the other, so as not to cut what does not need it, as you can see.
Chapter One and Twenty-Eight.
On the incision of the veins, which exudes blood and cutting it and treating the cracks.
Veins are on the arteries, either they are inside a cavity resembling red ants or like grapes, and there are small and large ones, and blood is always exuding from them.
One is present, and many are, and they are outside the cavity, except that those which are outside the cavity have less moisture and exude a small amount of white water or little blood constantly, and their color is the same as the body.
The treatment for what is inside the cavity is to order the patient to stretch and sweat until the cavity appears, and then you will see the clots, hurry up and hold them with forceps or grasp them with your fingers, then cut it at its roots, if it does not adhere to the forceps due to its moisture and softness.
Apply a thick splint or a piece of firm bandage to it, or draw it with your fingers, then cut it, and afterward rub on it with some pointed ointments so that its place may heal quickly or let it dry on the matter described in the chapter of sutures.
Treat it with all kinds of treatment until it heals, if the abscess does not require lancing, inject oil into it to clean what is in the abscess and hasten its discharge as soon as pus appears, for abscesses that are outside the abscess should be treated with hot water.
Take it with tweezers or tie it with a strong thread, then cut it and treat it as we have mentioned until it heals. If there is aversion to cutting with iron, use forceps of this type; take a loose thread and insert it into the needle.
Draw the abscess up to its source from the other side and insert the needle into it, then pull the ends of the thread below the needle tightly, the abscess will be resistant and tighten strongly, then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this for all abscesses and leave one untreated.
Draw out the pus from it (the wound), then place on the cushion a linen or silk bag filled with oil and put it on the wound, and command the patient to be quiet, and leave him until the pus drops out. If the pus falls out, treat it with leeches and other treatments until it heals.
The treatment for ulcers is often due to accumulation of phlegm and obstruction, if it persists and the medicine does not help, then it should be scratched with a lancet or a blunt instrument until it becomes moist and the upper layer that prevents healing peels off.
Then treat it until it heals as required, if it does not heal, repeat the procedure with a stronger scarification until it bleeds and then treat it, for it will heal.
Chapter Two and Eighty.
On the treatment of twisted fractures, non-twisted fractures and dry pus and ulcers.
The fracture is a continuous band on the body resembling a camel's hump that occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower limbs and fingers, and it causes pain during walking.
It is necessary to cut what surrounds the sutures, and hold with forceps or scissors, then remove its base, and treat it. As for the hardened thorns, one of them is the small, hard, pointed nettles found on the surface of the body.
Often found on the hands of children is the thorn, and its treatment is to apply warm oil or wool thread or hair until it falls off, or you can burn it with fire or medicine that dissolves it.
The opposite and non-opposite thorns can be removed with the machine I mentioned in the treatment of scorpions. As for scorpions, they are also small pointed nettles that are very deep within the body and when it freezes, its pain is similar to a wasp sting.
There is a worm in the body, and it is most commonly found in the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube from an eagle feather or hawk quill and make that tube surround the worm so that its circular circumference encompasses it. Then, rotate your hand around the tube until what surrounds the worm is cut.
It will sink into the flesh and the maggot will be removed from its source, if you wish to do so, you can do it with a copper or iron tube on this image:.
It should be higher at the tip to be easily grasped and squeezed, and if you wish, you can put the maggot in any of the tubes found at the opening:.
The Third and Twenty-Eighth Section.
In the images of tools that are used for puncturing in cases of hemorrhoids, fistulas and ulcers (abscesses).
The needle can be made of gold, silver, copper or brass, and this tool can be made in various sizes according to the users. The tool used for treating the minor wounds of infants and those with narrow or painful buttocks should be small, whereas the one used for larger wounds is larger, image of a large needle:.
The upper part that binds the ligature should be wide for it to have a grip where the ligature can be tightened as you see, and the lower part which enters into the buttock should be narrow towards the tip on one side with two holes and on the other side with one hole.
The cavity of the wound should be on the white part of the bone, or slightly on the yellow. The pouch that you make with the drugs from an animal bladder or a thin bag made of skin, should be small in size, being like a small pouch.
Drill numerous holes as much as possible and let them be on the white part of the bone, then put threads and needles made of a fine silk through each hole, and collect all the holes with the pouch (pouch-like structure) similar to a small sack. If the medicine is placed firmly at the tip of the lancet between the two bones, then prick with it. This image shows a circular pouch and hole arrangement.
The method of pricking is to fill the bladder or the bag with medicine as much as the likelihood allows, and be careful not for it to become too hot or too cold. Then the patient is made to lie on his back, and the pricker raises the patient's arm above his head.
Place a cloth or mat under him, then smear the handle of the lancet with oil or white lead or something similar, then insert it into the pouch and place it in the holder. Then the attendant takes hold of the pouch with his hands and shakes it violently until everything inside the lancet is expelled from its tip.
Then, the lancet is drawn out and the opening is filled with the remedy for expulsion; if the medicine adheres to it, it should be gripped firmly and even if he sleeps all through the night, it will have effect; if a lancet is injected into an ulcer of the eye and hastily withdrawn, let the lancet be held on until it is released.
If there is a boil or painful abscess in the seat, let the lancet be very soft and thin, milder than those used for children's lancing; this is an image of a soft, tight-held lancet:.
The Fourth and the Eighty-Seventh Chapter.
On Surgical Treatments.
I have previously mentioned in the classification of diseases what requires excision and now I shall explain their treatment by hands and medicines to perfection; I say that surgeries differ according to the thing which is subjected to the incision and according to the place where the cut occurs.
The things subjected to incision are numerous, such as stone, metal objects, swords or knives, bones, and other similar objects.
And regarding the incisions according to body parts, they are such as an incision on the head, neck, chest, abdomen or back and similar organs.
I will describe the treatment of some surgeries to make them a standard, and my rules apply to all other surgeries. I shall begin with simple head surgeries as compound ones will be discussed in the third chapter of this book.
Whenever a simple wound occurs in the head and it is not a bone fracture, if it appears to be due to a stone or similar object and only skin has been torn, and the wound is large and one fears the occurrence of a severe burn, I advise to cauterize with heat at the site. Do not delay this and extract from the wound an amount of blood to its extent of strength, unless prevented by something. Also, it is better that the blood which comes out of the wound flows towards the injured side.
Warn the patient against excessive drinking, eating rich food and alcohol, as they may prevent cauterization. In such a case, he should eat less and avoid meat and drink, and apply to the wound if burn occurs with a hot fluid or one containing alcohol.
If the burn is not severe, apply to the wound with its own blood and let air reach it for a little while as I have described to you earlier, but if the air has changed it, apply some ointment.
Until the wound drains, then treat it until it heals. If the injury is severe and caused by a sword or similar and the edges do not meet, sew it together with sutures as described in the abdominal surgeon's stitching.
If the skin is torn from bone and there is no tissue adhering to it except in a loose area, cut it, then treat the wound with medicines that make the flesh tough like oak bark and command the patient to eat nutritious foods such as heads (of animals) and garlic, etc.
If a blister occurs in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, cut all of it and then treat it. In these kinds of wounds there may be veins or arteries that bleed profusely and are not stopped by medicines. In such cases, probe the veins.
If the wound is not deep, tie it with a ligature and if necessary, if what we have mentioned does not help, wait until the bleeding stops. These kinds of wounds are simple and easy to treat; all that is required is to let them heal by themselves with their own blood.
Before it is affected by air, the recipe for the plaster of emeralds consists of taking a portion from milk, a portion from eggs and three portions from either cooked or uncooked lime. All are crushed and mixed together to treat wounds, making them strong and sticky so they adhere well to the injury and harden strongly.
It is to be sewn up with sutures, then left for the pus to drain from above without being allowed to heal until it does not cause swelling anymore; because the medicine will not work on it otherwise. Lime can do this alone if milk and eggs are not available.
This action can also be done with both sides in many large wounds, if it is mastered and placed on it and sutured, and the wounds were clean and not affected by air, whereas if they were affected by air partially or especially during summer.
To apply this plaster, it means treating it with what we have mentioned before, i.e., placing some tied clamps on it or applying a poultice made of fine barley flour and water and honey until the pus is drained, then treating it with other treatments until it heals.
If a fracture occurs along with a wound in the bone that is simple, draw it together with forceps. I have mentioned the treatment of skull fractures in an earlier section, in the surgery of the neck. If a wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in the treatment between this and a simple skull fracture.
If a vein or artery has been cut from the neck, if it is an artery, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with strong constricting devices such as forceps, scissors and similar instruments because they harm the artery and cause it to contract.
Do not place anything cold on the wound because the surface of the artery is cold and its connection with the brain, which is the noblest of organs, can be treated with mild medicines such as cleaned olive oil or melted butter and warm water.
If you wash the wound and all metal stones and damp bandages with warm water, and if the wound is large, use stitching or tie it up with string then treat it until it heals.
If there is a cavity in the wound and pus has collected at the bottom, squeeze it out to a lower place, if an artery has been cut in the wound and its blood spurts, tie it or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has severed some hairs of the scalp or all of it and the edges have been sutured, gather the skin together by sewing on a ball of the scalp and do not press the scalp but rather smooth and spread it out in its natural shape, then tighten it firmly and leave it for days.
Then treat it with antimony and drying until it forms a crust. If the wound has exposed bone, examine it to see if there are fragments of bone. If so, remove all or as much as possible that cannot be removed and leave it until the wound heals and forms a scab.
If the wound is ulcerated, let it dry on its own. If bone necrosis occurs and turns black, treat as described previously, for thoracic and intercostal surgery.
If it is a wound caused by sword or knife, and you see a cavity in it, check if air escapes when the patient breathes, in which case it is a war wound. If there is no cavity and it is ulcerated with blood, do not apply anything to it at first and do not tighten it lest the blood clots in its cavity.
Put it into the heart, and you will kill the ailment, but make in it two cauterizing irons and heat them in the daytime twice. If it does not appear for you, make in the wound of the injured person a bladder with vinegar to absorb what comes out of it from the moisture, and put the patient to sleep on the injury.
Cure what accumulates in it, and if it has passed more than three days for the injury without the ailment manifesting or any swelling, or constriction of the throat or tightness in the soul, and you see all its conditions good, then know that the wound is safe; treat it with ointment and other remedies until it heals.
If it becomes hard to probe and the fish remains constant, then know that it has become a scab; treat it at its opening, let the ailment be cured in the wound, whether it is on the chest or back; treat it with whatever stitching comes first.
If it is large or has bumps, whether it is large or small; if it has affected the bone and cut pieces from it, probe the wound and try to extract those pieces if they are free; if they are not free, leave them until.
The incision (wound) is easy to treat, as for other surgeries that occur in various body parts, their treatment is as we have previously mentioned.
The Fifth and Eighteenth Section.
On abdominal surgery, removal of the foreign body, and its suturing.
A wound that occurs in the abdomen may be large or small and may be central, in which case it may expel a foreign body or multiple foreign bodies. The process of introducing them and suturing is more difficult and challenging.
A small wound may also be difficult from another perspective, requiring the return to be more challenging and the removal of the foreign body to be difficult if it does not enter at the right time, causing swelling and making its insertion difficult for this reason, a medium-sized wound is considered better because it does not cause additional difficulty with the return of the foreign body, as it is in these two types.
And know that abdominal suturing can be done in two ways, one of which is suitable for abdominal suturing and the other for suturing other abdominal surgeries, while the others are specific to other surgeries except that they specialize in abdominal suturing.
And I shall explain to you one by one, with detail and clarity. If the wound is small and something from the vein comes out of it and it tightens up, that is either because the wound is shallow, as we have mentioned, or because the vein was exposed to breath inhalation.
If it is like that, it is necessary to cauterize it by touching a damp sponge or lint in boiling water and then apply it to the vein until it coagulates and stops bleeding.
The drink that contains a clot is better than water in stopping bleeding, so if you see the bleeding has stopped, press the vein with boiled water using tweezers or cloth, because it will make its return easier.
If its return is difficult after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound with an instrument that cuts veins and perform the initial treatment again if possible, because it is better than making an incision and only do so when absolutely necessary and when other methods fail, as shown in this image:.
The narrow end of the instrument should be curved and the other end should not be curved, and the tip should not be sharp but slightly rounded, and it is an instrument resembling a small scoop as you can see. If the wound expands and the vein enters it, its return should be in its natural form.
If possible, the surgeon should place himself in a position that is best for him. However, if the wound is extensive and located in the lower abdomen, he should make the patient lie on his back and raise the affected side above his head. If it is in the upper abdomen, he should raise the patient's head and chest from below.
If the wound is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, make your intention and aim always to raise the side where the surgery is taking place above the other side. This should be done during major surgeries and during middle surgeries as well.
In small surgeries, place the patient as you deem fit, then gather an assistant by your side who will hold the wound with both hands and press it together. Then, let a person in charge of sewing open a little at a time for sewing.
This is the standard method of suturing, where you take a thread or multiple threads according to the size of the wound, then leave a margin of skin around the wound before stitching with only one needle without inserting any thread into it. With the scalpel that is beneath the skin, from inside to bring it out from that side, and my incisions of the skin and the scalpel became four squares, then I tighten a twisted thread around the vein in both directions until the wound edges meet firmly.
Then, leave the fingernail's side open and tie another vein, then bind it with thread as you did with the first vein, continue to do so for any additional required veins until all the wound is drained and the vein is moderately situated between the bone and the flesh.
Because the cutting vein is very sharp and quickly cuts meat and bone as well, making it difficult to enter the skin, therefore, it is best that the vein be situated in the middle of the bone and flesh, and not tied near the edge of the skin.
To prevent the meat from being cut too quickly and to avoid delaying the suturing, do not tie it too far away, then cut the edges of the vein so as not to harm the patient while sleeping and to make benefits from applying cataplasms on both sides of the vein.
Leave it until you learn that incision is healed, and this kind of suturing with catgut is more suitable for minor surgeries because it may be sufficient in its suturing with a single or two catguts or similar.
As for the second technique, it is to gather four sutures which mean the skin and subcutaneous tissue stitches in one go with catgut having a thread well balanced in thickness and tension. Then when this catgut is used to sew these four sutures, draw the catgut from the side where it started.
The thread should be knotted from the top of the incision so that the suturing is done according to the stitching of the akinetosis which causes less pain and makes between each stitch and the next by pressing the small finger this kind of suturing is known to all people.
With this suturing, a surgeon can perform an incision exposed on the abdomen of a man who was stabbed with two knives and the wound was larger than a finger and had exited from his waist about 15 fingers from the central navel and the wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
He recovered after keeping his fracture outside the wound for four and twenty hours, then the wound started healing in about fifteen days, and he was treated until he purged, and afterwards lived many years, managing all his affairs. The physicians ruled that he would not be cured of the fracture (gout).
It is surprising that I did not treat him with medicine because I was in a place where there was nothing to find for medication, so I put on the wound lint twice a day and committed to washing it with honey water until he purged.
And as for one of the specific types of embroidery, I have mentioned it on the word of Galenus, that it begins with the skin and enters from outside to inside; if the thread comes out in the skin and in the sinew that runs along the length of the backbone, all of it.
I removed the stitch from the side where I inserted the thread, and the thread came out on the other side of the embroidery from inside to outside in the other side; if it comes out, take another one in the same place from outside to inside.
Open the scissors on one side and pierce it with a needle in its other side from inside to outside, and pierce together with your puncture into the scissor until you pierce all of them into the handle which is on that side.
Then, also start from this side with his eye and trace it along the handle of the scissor which is on the other side, and draw out the needle from the skin near it, then return it to that skin and trace the handle of the scissor on the other side with this handle of the thread.
Draw it out from the skin which is on that side, and do this again until you stitch all the incision with this kind of stitching. This type of stitching is called the stitches for fraying [fabric].
Stitch the scissor once from one side with the skin and leave it on the other side until it is empty, and as for the second type of unique stitching that he also mentioned [Al-Zahrawi], this is his word.
Stitch it in a way that a group of healers stitches all its parts to a matching problem for him, by connecting the handles of the scissor together and the handles of the thread together, and this will be what is suitable for him.
It is necessary to tie the suture outside and insert it into [the wound] by itself, then leave the suturing needle aside, then pull the suture out from outside to inside in the same place, then insert it again outside to inside in the same location. Do this twice, then pull it out again.
Pull the suture from inside to outside at another site that is opposite [the first one], and this stitch is better than a simple, easy stitch which he mentioned earlier. This statement is by Galenus in his writing, and some say that abdominal suturing with two sutures may be crooked. Insert a single thread and start by inserting one suture from your side and pulling it to the other side, then insert the other suture from the opposite side of where you started, pull it from your side according to the pattern of knitting a sock.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then suturing it will be more difficult than other areas of the abdomen. As for sewing the wound, its judgement is like that of all wounds and that is: if you find the wound straight with the flesh before air or moisture changes it, and you have removed the dirt and marked it, then cover it with lint.
If the wound has been altered by air, apply some cauteries until it seizes and the threads fall out and the cautery burns the flesh and the muscle, then treat it as you would any other surgery until it heals.
If you do not have medication, apply a clean linen cloth on it from the start and change it twice a day as you know, until it heals. In most cases, there is no need for additional treatment if the surgeries are simple. However, if you fear that the main joints will share in the pain.
It is necessary to apply a linen cloth in warm olive oil or butter and place it over the areas between the armpits and groin, if you feel pain or swelling in these places, this may help greatly by drinking a concoction of strong black tea.
If the swelling has reached the point where there is an opening to the abdomen, know that whatever is thick in the armpit area will be easier to heal, while what is thin will be more difficult.
As for the known swelling, it does not accept healing from a surgery that involves the buttock, because there is a large amount of veins and bones there, as well as its proximity to the sciatic nerve. However, if you have encountered a wound that is shallow and you can reach it easily, then drain it according to your ability to drain the swelling.
If it has a duration and turns green or black, it should be pressed with thread above the darkened area so as not to expose blood flow. For in the wound there are veins and arteries, then cut what is beyond that band.
Make the edges of the thread protrude from below the surgery, outside it, to facilitate its tightening and removal upon falling of the stitching and healing of the wound. Remember the surgery that exposes a crack in the wound and is small.
It may happen that some people, because they saw a man who had been stabbed in his abdomen with a spear and the wound was on the right side of the navel, he (the doctor) treated it as if he did not dare to treat him (the patient). I did not cauterize it until it erupted and swelled at the site, then when I saw the swelling, I feared that something bad might happen to him in his depth. However, it did not develop a severe abscess from this, and he remained in good condition. He eats and drinks and gathers together and goes to the bathhouse and enjoys himself in his service, and some of those experienced have said that if he is exposed in the private part (genitals) and is small, it is necessary to circumcise him.
He takes large wasps, then he cuts off their heads. Then, he collects the stings and places a nest from them, with open mouths on the wounds. If he catches it (the wasp) and tightens it, it sticks and does not dissolve. Then, he places another nest near the first one.
And keep doing that with several wasps according to the wound size, then press it (the wound) and tie it up so that the heads remain sticking in the private part until the private part becomes inflamed and swollen, and no severe abscess happens, and you can also tie the private part with a thin thread.
The one who binds the wounded animal after it has entered an artery, should take a part of this thread from the animals, then tie a fine, flexible cord around it before inserting it into the artery. In it is a thread of the animals, wrapped with it is the wound before inserting into the depths (of the body). This beating of the threads with the snake and the animals is only on the path of recklessness and hope.
If the wound is large and wide, and without doubt if it is in one of the soft arteries, there is no trick (or method) for healing and no relief from death.
Sixteenth Chapter.
Treatment of hemorrhoids and piles.
Know that every wound or injury, if it persists and develops into a boil which does not heal, and if it constantly discharges pus (or matter), is called in general terms "piles" or "hemorrhoids", regardless of the limb where they occur. The Arabic term for them is "nāṣūr" and we call them "zakām.
It is true that a swollen white stone without pain has the shape of an egg like the beak of a bird.
Due to this, some of them call it a cyst, and at times it becomes wet permanently, causing putrefaction; however, the moisture may sometimes break in certain instances, and this moisture can be abundant or scanty, thick or thin.
Every abscess does not escape or grow in it, for there are several reasons, one of which is a lack of blood in the body or its blockage, or because within it and on its surface, there is hard muscle tissue that prevents good meat from growing. It may be abundant in pus and festering, or because the abscess itself is rotten and the substance that contains it has poor quality, or because the medicine is not suitable for treating it, or due to a malady that occurred in the town of Wabasha, or due to a specific problem in the town.
It may be abundant in pus and festering, or because the abscess itself is rotten and the substance that contains it has poor quality, or because the medicine is not suitable for treating it, or due to a malady that occurred in the town of Wabasha, or due to a specific problem in the town. As seen in the city of Saragossa, where it is difficult to diagnose and treat diseases; and perhaps because there is a single or multiple bone within it, and all these causes and their symptoms and treatments have been clearly demonstrated and explained with medicine in the textbook.
It is necessary for me to inform you about the treatment of nasal ulcers and scabs that are treated by hand manipulation. Know that veins can appear in all body parts, some of which end up in large arteries or nerves.
Some of them [veins] end up in the fingernail or wrist, or in the phalanx of the fingers on the hand and foot, and they approach closely to the joints such as the wrist joint and so forth.
Among these veins are those diseases that cannot be treated or manipulated easily, for if they are not at the locations mentioned and desired, then there is hope for their treatment.
If you wish to know that, then take a copper or iron probe if the nasal ulcer is firm, and test it with the probe. If there is a thickening in the nasal ulcer, use a sharp lead probe, as lead softens the body.
If the nasal ulcer has many cavities, you will not be able to probe it with a probe, so press one of its cavities and the moisture that is pressed from it will flow towards the other cavity and dissolve it.
From here, feel for any bone, muscle, or nerve nearby. Determine if the navus is deep or shallow, or if there are multiple navi present. Stand firm on all these points based on your ability to discern its presence and the pain that arises when you touch the location.
These are some of the indications and causes of pain, so if you stand firm on all these points and your conclusion is true, then look for treatment based on that and it is to observe if there is.
If the navus is visible nearby or in a safe location far from tendon, muscle, nerve, vein, or any of the locations mentioned for you, then break the navus according to the description provided and remove what is inside it of decaying flesh, rotten meat, and excessive meat.
If no growth is found in the mouth, or anything similar to that, and it is treated until it heals, if the navus is deep-seated and away from the edge and standing firm, then break it deeply as much as you can, then clean it completely of all decaying meat.
Then use the suppurating wound for sharp medicines and grind it into the nasal cavity which is reached with iron, do that repeatedly until the sharp medicine consumes all the corruption left in the nasal cavity.
Then force him to vomit with emetics that cause meat to come up correctly, if he does not vomit with this, press on what precedes and describe it, if the cause of the nasal cavity problem is bone and it is sound according to you, probe it and break it at the point where you were informed that it does not prevent you from.
If a nerve, vein or limb of the head is exposed as we mentioned earlier and if you find bone inside it with some corruption and blackness, expel it until the corruption goes away, then treat it with what heals it until it heals and comes back to normal, if it does not heal and the wound worsens as it used to.
Know that you have not reached all the corruptions, so expose everything surrounding it and cut away its membrane and clean it with great effort, then force him to vomit. If he vomits, it is good, otherwise know that this corruption is in a deep cavity far from the main corruption, so expose everything surrounding it again.
Extract the pus and clean it with great effort, for the decayed bone is small and can be drawn out. Draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, extract and draw them all carefully without leaving anything behind. If something from the ligaments resists you, but there is no risk in it, cut those ligaments and flesh if present, then clean the bone.
If you are unable to extract the bone at your convenience, bear the wound and leave it for a few days until the flesh and ligaments around the bone are softened. Keep the wound clean so that it does not become infected as a result of the incision you made while working on it.
Place a dressing over it if you are afraid of that, made from cotton soaked in pulverized quicklime and oil or a cotton dressing soaked in Egyptian natron or any other green antiseptic. For when it softens the ligaments and exposes the bone, it will be easy to extract and draw it out.
If there is a single large bone like the shin or thigh bone, and only part of it is decayed, cleanly amputate it until the darkened and decayed area disappears. Then force the wound open, for if the decay has reached a considerable extent and the decay has penetrated deep into the bone, there is no choice but to excise it.
Cut it (the part) to where the disease ends, then treat it until it heals. I inform you about a man who presented a case of gangrene in his thigh for demonstration and as an example for your treatment; this man was alive.
For about thirty years, he had a pain in his thigh caused by internal movement towards it from the body until the substances reached the thigh and caused severe swelling and inflammation, but there was no external cause. Then time passed with the mistake of doctors until the abscess opened.
From him, numerous substances emerged and his treatment was poor until the thigh turned gangrenous and many holes formed in it, all of which leaked pus and the body fluids; a group of doctors tried to treat him for about two years but none of them were skilled in surgery.
Until I intended to examine him, I saw his thigh and the substances flowing from those holes in large amounts and the man was lying on his bed with a pale body color; I inserted a probe into one of the holes and it passed through the bone then examined all the holes.
I found that some of them were connected to various parts of the thigh; when I probed one of the holes, I discovered part of the bone that was decayed and blackened, softened and crumbled until the hole reached the muscle; the decay spread wherever I uncovered it.
I am able to cure the rotten bone, and I think that there is no corruption in the bone other than what I have cut and dissected. I have definitely cured it, then made the wound take a longer time to heal with medicinal powders so that it did not harden. Then I counted, and found another layer of bone above the first examination.
I found the corruption connected to the bone, so I dissected what appeared to me of that corruption, then softened it with a tool without hardening. Then I examined it again and found that it had not healed. So I kept on cutting the bone piece by piece, and softening it without letting it heal until I reached a cavity in the bone.
Extracted it with a tool, then hardened it with medicine so that it healed quickly and recovered. However, this repetition is necessary in his work, as well as breaking it open due to its weakness and low probability, and fear of death since it would happen to him at every moment from the excessive bleeding which covered his wound and recovered completely.
Found a hard bone tissue in the location of the bone, and its condition was good in his body and it regained its strength and returned to normal functioning without any harm from the splinter, for if the bone was not solid in a part of the body, it would break.
It is required that a suture be drawn on this side and tightened on the soft tissue edge, then instruct someone to push it upwards. Another suture made from a stronger thread should then remain.
Then, suture the meat beneath the bone and pull its edge downwards to draw the meat upwards and expose the area you wish to stitch without harming the knife with the meat. Place a stick or flat stone under the bone firmly from below.
If you do that, the knife will not prevent the bone from being cut, and it is required that the stitch be above the defect slightly to avoid hollowing out the bone. It should not be too deep so as not to appear on the surface for palpation, requiring another stitch.
If the bone is rotten and not open, but there is a defect in its center or one of its sides, expose the meat from all sides, then place a stick from below, then stitch it from the first side where the defect is located.
If you finish stitching, stitch it from the other side and let the stitch be a little distance away from the defect as we said, if the defect is in a joint, then cut the diseased joint and sew the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the damage is in a separated joint, there is no remedy other than cauterization. If the damage is in the hand or leg tendon, treatment of it is very difficult. However, it should be incised and cauterized as it appears to you, then cleaned on any condition that you can manage.
With whatever means it is possible for you to reduce it when the artery or nerve does not oppose, and know that many cuts are made in these bones according to their position, and they are sawn, drilled, scraped, carved, stretched, shrunk, and hardened. Therefore, it is necessary to have a tool specifically for every type of work.
Know that the works themselves can lead to the type of tool required for them, if you have a long staff with knowledge of these crafts because mastery of these crafts is one of the skills necessary to see the afflictions. A suitable tool for each disease may be required of itself, and I am drawing for you in the end of this chapter various tools.

Chapter Seven and Eight.
On the amputation of limbs and the cutting of bones.
If the limb's extremity becomes gangrenous, either from external or internal cause, if treating the illness with medication does not cure it and the condition worsens within the limb without subsiding, then amputation is indicated.
It is necessary to amputate the affected limb up to the point where the gangrene has reached, thus saving the patient from death or extreme suffering which is greater than losing the limb. A sign that this should be done is when the limb turns black as if it were burnt by fire.
Or the gangrene may spread beyond the blackness, reaching further along the limb and entering the body, necessitating amputation. Similarly, if the cause of the gangrene is a wound from sea creatures such as sharks or crocodiles or rays and so on.
If the illness or wound is in the fingertip, amputate only the tip and do not delay as the gangrene may reach the hand. Similarly, if it has entered the hand, amputate from the wrist and again do not delay as the gangrene may advance to the forearm.
And likewise, if a fracture occurs in the arm, it should be cut at the joint in the middle, for it is permissible to allow foul play and you should pull it towards the neck, but do not cut the neck of the bone, for in this case there is death imminent. Instead, use another method of treatment according to your ability.
And likewise, if a fracture occurs in the finger, it should be cut at one of the knuckles. If a fracture occurs in the leg, then cut the leg at its tendon, and if the fracture is at the thigh, then cut the thigh at the hip. If there is an ascent to the knee, then cut the shin at the joint of the knee.
If the fracture has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and let the patient die peacefully. The method of cutting or breaking the limb is to tie ropes below the site where you intend to cut, then apply tension to another rope above the site.
The one who holds the rope pulls it down, and the other who holds the upper rope pulls it upwards until you stretch the meat between the ropes until all of the meat is exposed. Then it is cut or broken, and it is preferable to break the bone completely.
If the saw is not placed correctly, it will cause excessive pain and burning, therefore if bleeding occurs during your procedure, quickly move the location or apply some hemostatic agents to stop the bleeding, then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then tie the severed limb with a splint that is suitable for it and treat it until it heals, and I will inform you of an example of a case presented to me concerning a man in whose leg this similar case occurred: there was a blackness resembling fire in his leg.
This corruption first occurred in his finger, and the man took all of them, and when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb with great pain and burning, he amputated it at the joint, and it healed.
After a long time, he presented this corruption to me in his little finger of the hand with its tip swollen. He brought it to me, wrapped it with bandages containing the medicines that had been applied to his arm after cleaning the affected area. The corruption did not spread and made him try on the other finger.
He took the corruption in his hand and asked me to amputate it, fearing for himself from this corruption spreading, and also feared death due to the fall as he was on a steep slope. When I refused, he left for his country.
It has been reported to me that it was Baldur, who cut off his own hand with a rope, and he survived. I narrate this story as an example for what happens in this type of disease, and as a reference that one can rely on and act upon.
The Eighth Chapter and the Eighty.
On the Treatment of Abscesses and Methods of Injecting Medicines into Them.
If a boil occurs in one of the flesh-like body parts, and the duration of the boil increases until it collects pus, then either explodes or releases everything that was inside it and leaves the location empty as if it were an empty container.
And the skin that is like a blister, if it becomes inflamed but has not yet become severe, it does not affect bone, muscle, or nerves. From here it is appropriate to call it an abscess and not a boil unless its duration prolongs until the inflammation affects one of these body parts.
Then it is called a boil or a carbuncle, and its treatment is to cut off the entire skin layer that surrounds it, taking care not to tear it if it has become inflamed like a blister and you are certain that it will not adhere to the location due to the pus.
If a skin graft fails to adhere and there is no corruption, that amount (of tissue) which is in the skin contains a cyst of meat, it should be treated with cupping. Observe the cyst, if it is large and the unpleasant smell emanates from it, administer Egyptian medication by cupping.
Take honey, olive oil, and beeswax in any quantity and mix them together in a vessel. Cook on fire until the medicine solidifies into honey. Then take as much as you need, wet it with water and honey, draw it up in a cupping glass, apply it to the cyst, press it firmly, and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
Then, remove it in the evening (of that day). Repeat this process for several days until the cyst is cleaned and the stench disappears. If the above medicine does not work, draw up ashes of carob or ashes of fig tree leaves with water.
Clean it and continue cupping until you are certain that the cyst is cleaned, if there is a possibility of failure for both the Egyptian medicine and water ashes, draw up water and honey mixed with some powdered beeswax.
Examine it with honey and alcohol mixed, because it is the nature of honey to cleanse and purify, and alcohol penetrates the affected area well, especially if there is a deposit in it. If you do this several times and believe that the deposit has disappeared, test it again with what meat grows in it.
Take a piece of mature leeches, clean and rinse them with oil and wine or test it with some medicines and other known leeches that have proven properties in the article on leeches. If there is a narrowness in the affected area and the cannula does not fit, it means that the obstruction has been removed.
Stretch it slightly with iron or place inside it a pliable Egyptian leech or Syrian leech until it expands, and similarly if the mouth is also wide, gather both eyes with thread and leave only enough space for the cannula to enter without excess.
Similarly, if the mouth from which pus rises is elevated above, make a shallow place in it to drain the pus downwards because pus, when it adheres in the cavity of the affected area, prevents the meat from growing in it.
If you cannot break open the joint as intended below, then form a dislocation so that the limb may be easily restored to its original position without anything from the dislocated bone remaining trapped within it.
As for the medicated plasters placed on the joint from outside and the manner in which they should be applied to it, it is as follows: Take a medicated plaster suitable for your needs, roll it onto a matchstick until the matchstick is as long as the entire joint, so that it can fully cover it. Then, with a probe (mqs), make an incision in the joint, wider than the joint slightly. Then, using soft lint from the medicated plaster, roll it onto another matchstick to fit the size of the incision and place it on top, spaced away from the joint's opening to facilitate the removal of the dislocated bone and not remove the large incision immediately.
The number of days [to wait] and, as for the dressing on the joint, it is one that removes it at every moment to let out what has gathered in it, so you can know if anything from the dislocated bone is present – whether it's a lot or little, soft or hard.
If this also applies, does the patient feel pain in the place of the abscess or not? Is there no pain at all in the abscess? And is there swelling or not in the abscess? If your treatment proceeds like this and you observe the substance that comes out easy from the mouth of the abscess.
Know that the abscess has adhered or is about to adhere, so open it tomorrow or on the third day and whenever the incision was made, replace the instrument with another one and renew the dressing. If after a long period, a thin pus comes out from the abscess, do not be afraid of the swelling.
This pus is close at hand because some people stop the growth of flesh in their surgery and there are others who avoid this, if after many days a thick pus comes out which is not clear, know that the abscess did not adhere. If the abscess persists without being opened, it will rot.
The matter is lengthy, so let there be more in the drying of the medicines to make them retain moisture and have firmness similar to sticky plasters. If it increases, add more than the required amount of calamine. And that which is best treated with it is a sticky plaster.
The application of warm oil and vinegar is permissible on it, then the approved alcohol is poured onto it and kneaded with it, and it is used. If fresh fig honey is not available, you can cook it until it becomes white and use it or take mustard, salt, pepper, and grind them all together and leave it on the honey that is on fire. Then grind it on a flat surface or grind with honey that has been cooked until it becomes white, place the figs on top of it and press down.
In such cases, long Zarwand (a type of herb), Asafoetida, powdered cinnamon, and Ginger can be used individually or together. They are crushed, kneaded into fig honey (as previously described) and applied. If the wound persists for a long time and does not respond to this treatment, know that there is corruption in it.
It has an effect on bones or other hard tissues and joints, treat it with Nasaur treatment as described.
The ninth and the twenty-eighth chapters.
On the treatment of fistulas, abscesses that persist, and cutting off excess fingernails and removing calluses.
The Dahas is a large tumor that grows under the skin of the hand or leg, and sometimes in other fingers; if it persists and treatment is neglected, it causes severe pain and swelling.
The dahas can also lead to decay and rot, causing the skin to eat away until it reaches the bone and emits a foul odor. It may even cause complete decay of all the fingers, or the decay may spread to the bone such that the tip of the finger becomes exposed and its color turns black. If treated with what has been described in the division [part] and if there is no improvement, the treatment has failed.
It is necessary to cut all the pus that grows from the skin using iron, then suture the wound afterwards as this method is highly effective. If the bone and the skin are both healthy.
The angle of the tumor has drawn the flesh into it and blocked it, it is necessary to place a thin piece of iron under this angle and raise it up, then cut the affected meat along with it.
Place the burning, consuming medicine on what remains of the flesh until it disappears completely, then treat it with a purgative to make it discharge. If decay has occurred in the bone, it is necessary to cut and remove that bone as it will not heal while any remaining bone is rotten.
If you find an ulcer and corruption in the thumb, cut it in one of the joints as it is mentioned, then treat it until it heals. If the bone (of the thumb) is struck or broken and severe pain occurs, it is necessary to remove the cause first.
Then, make a sharp cut on the bone obliquely from above to below and prevent it from reaching the flesh beneath the bone, for by doing so you cause pain and damage due to the fracture and there will be a buildup of extra tissue at the site. Treat the wound accordingly.
As for the excessive thumbs that grow on some people, it may not be entirely made of flesh or it may contain bone in some cases, or there may be a bone and a nail growing separately from one of the fingers.
Or it may grow in some of the joints (between fingers) that do not move, and it may grow at the joint separating the fingers. If it is not made of flesh, simply cut it near its base with a straight incision.
As for the one whose root is in the palm, its cure is difficult and it should be excised with care. And as for the one that grows in the nail of one of the Slamites [slaves], it is necessary to first cut off its flesh and then spread the bone with a suitable saw.
Then cure it until it heals, and as for the adhesion that affects some fingers with each other, it often occurs and is one of those things that may cause harm to man, especially due to injury or burns and similar things. It is necessary to break this adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural position, then place something between them, either a thread or a splint soaked in oil of roses so that it does not adhere quickly and separates them. Or make a thin lead sheet between them until the situation is as it should be.
And similarly, if adhesion occurs between some fingers and the wrist, break that adhesion according to what is appropriate and it will heal in the shape of the limb.
The chapter is forty.
On amputation.
The amputation is the cutting of swollen, hard, blackened ulcers that occur in most parts of the body and are mostly found in the feet, toes, and hands. It is necessary to use leeches from the black one several times powerfully.
Then extract the bladder of the animal, as for its treatment with iron, it will be on two strikes: one to make it break and black blood and the other to make it seep and extract it along with the urine, if it breaks then it should be heated first with hot water.
Allow the thick blood to congeal, then draw the probe from above and hold it below with a thread, then break the bladder in one or two or three places, widely.
Draw out the black blood from below the probe to above and from above to below until you extract the desired amount of blood that is sufficient or as much as the strength of the probe allows, then tie it and order it to abstain from food associated with the black color, and allow it to rest and recover.
When the bladder becomes full and is damaged by the probe, if there is a lot of hair in it, then cut off the probe, immerse it in hot water until it turns red or undergoes strong exercise.
If the water bath is not available until the limb becomes hot, then break the skin around the bladder, either at the end of the probe or at its base, then open the skin with scissors and draw out the urine from all sides until it can be felt.
When it appears red and swollen, if it is removed from the skin, it appears like a bladder; then enter a leech under it until it rises and comes out of the skin; tie it with a silk thread, then make another incision near that one, as far as three fingers.
Then cut the skin from above the vein until it appears, then lift it with a leech as you did earlier and tie it again with another silk thread, just as you did first; then make another incision near that one, or several incisions if necessary.
Then pull it out and cut it at the end of the incision at the armpit, then draw it out from the second incision, then draw it back to the first incision and repeat this until you draw it out from the third incision at the topmost armpits; when all of them have come out, cut it.
If you are not required to draw it out and tie it, insert a strong thread-like probe and secure it, then introduce a leech under it with your hand in all directions until it comes out and is preserved so that it does not break; if it breaks, it will make it difficult for you to pull it out.
The excerpt translates to: "When he (the patient) experiences poisoning, if all of it leaks out, place him on the operation table with a warm woolen cloth soaked in oil or fat and treat him until he recovers. If the case is serious with symptoms spreading, administer leeches at the affected areas.
"Do not press too hard as we have previously mentioned, but you should apply pressure to each of the affected areas and their sites, then bind them with bandages until they are all drained. Ensure that during the process of draining, neither the vein is cut nor injured because it will make it difficult for you to drain it, thus saving your effort.
"Image of leeches used for draining:.
"Image of the leech trap:
"The leech trap should not be sharp and its edge should not be pointed so as not to cut the vein and make it thicken, which would be detrimental if it is too thin because it could cut the vein with its movements. However, it should have a certain thickness as we have previously mentioned.
"Chapter 49:
"On the drainage of varicose veins.
"This varicose vein is born in warm countries like Hijaz, Arab countries and other less cool desert regions where it may also appear in other parts of the body apart from the legs and it develops beneath the skin due to injury.
As discussed within living bodies and intestines, the process of quarq and the quarq that arises between skin and meat, a sign that this condition begins in the intestine is when there is severe burning in the anus, then the area swells, followed by the quarq beginning to emerge from the location of that swelling.
It appears to be the root of a plant or an animal. If any part of it emerges, it is necessary to apply a small piece of lead weighing between a dirhem and two dirhems, tie it up, and leave the lead attached to the anus.
Whenever something emerges from it to the outside, tie it in lead and leave it for a long time if possible. If it is very long, cut off part of it and tie the remaining and do not cut it from its root before all of it comes out because if you cut it, it will break, enter the flesh, and cause abscess, foulness, and painful ulceration in the area.
Therefore, it is necessary to gently dig and probe a little at a time until it comes out completely and nothing remains in the body. This quarq may come out from some people in lengths of five or ten fingers.
It has reached me that a man had a wound of twenty cubits, if it is cut for you at the time of your treatment, insert merodah in the hole and beat it with a long stick along with the body until everything within it releases. Try to dissolve the location with medicines for several days.
Treat the abscess with the treatment for boils, and this abscess may have many stalks and if it appears in the groin or on the leg itself, several openings may occur and pus will come out of each opening. Treat as described in the division [section] and according to what follows.
The Second and Forty-Ninth Section.
In the wound on the udar which is born under the breast and it is called udar abscess of the cow.
This disease is called udar abscess of the cow in some countries because it often affects cows and it is a small stalk that appears between the skin and meat, rises and descends in the body.
The pressure can be felt from one body part to another until it breaks where it did not break in the skin, and it becomes an abscess with some mixtures as it is susceptible to boils and animals and worms in the abdomen.
It is expected that when it (something) has been inflicted, if it swells in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may open there and come out, thus blinding the eye. This happens often, so if you wish to treat and remove it, it will be at its site and can be felt by touch.
To compress the area above and below it firmly, then squeeze it and remove it. If it is embedded in the flesh but cannot be found, apply fire to the spot until it burns away. Do not hesitate to increase the heat as much as expected for its destruction of the eye as we have said.
If you see it has become in the head near the eye, compress firmly below it on the eyebrow, then squeeze and remove it. The person who assisted should ensure thorough cleansing of the body with easy-to-blend ointments for the healing of the wound and preserve from food that causes inflammation.
Third and forty-ninth section.
In the incision on the sickness known as the Nafr.
This disease called Nafr in our land is a wound that appears in some limbs and then moves from one part to another, and you have observed what I describe to you.
Call to a woman who is lame in some of the plains, she revealed her arm and I blew gently into the vein of the arm, when an hour passed, you saw the breath moving along with the tendon as a pulse moves upwards most quickly like quicksilver.
If asked from place to place, the pain remained in that location and settled in the neck, then I sat for an hour and it spread throughout the body until it reached the other arm, then I cut towards where I saw it rotating the entire body.
I was amazed at the speed of its movement from one limb to another, and I had not seen this disease in this way before except that I saw a group of people suffering from pain that moved from limb to limb, but I did not see it with my own eyes as I did in this woman.
I was not able to do that except because the woman belonged to the Bedouins, whose bodies were exposed veins. From here, the moving breath became noticeable and it should not appear on this scale among those who specialize in healing and hidden moist bodies with concealed veins.
If you want to treat it and the owner of it feels pain, if its surface appears to you like we previously mentioned, then press upon it with a lancet and below it with a leech until that enclosed air is expelled and the place heals.
If you do not see it with your eyes, treat it by using the fat of the body and that which stops the flow of air and softens it, like camphor, cumin, and similar medicines.
The fourth and fortieth section.
On the extraction of thorns.
Thorns may differ according to their types and the parts of the body in which they are found, and as for their differences based on their types, some are large and small, some are pointed and others are blunt, and among them are those with three sides and those with four.
Among them, some have roots and others do not, and as for those that are in the organs according to their types, they may be on bones such as the skull, heart, liver, neck, kidneys, lungs, stomach, and other similar ones. If a thorn occurs in any of these organs and you notice signs of death that I have previously described for you, it is necessary to avoid extracting the thorn from it because death usually happens to its owner in most cases. When these bleeding signs do not appear and the pulse is not pulsating in the limb, extract it (the foreign body) and treat the wound, and among the symptoms of the skull are if it swells and bones protrude and the scalp that covers the skull is injured, it indicates a strong pain, swelling, and throbbing.
When these bleeding signs do not appear and the pulse is not pulsating in the limb, extract it (the foreign body) and treat the wound, and among the symptoms of the skull are if it swells and bones protrude and the scalp that covers the skull is injured, it indicates a strong pain, swelling, and throbbing. Redness in the eyes and tongue swelling, confusion, loss of speech or sound, and pus-like discharge from the wound site, it is similar to meat broth.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the cause and extracting the foreign body unless it does not come out, and as for the symptoms of the heart if it occurs near the left side of the chest and you feel as though it has pierced something hard but not empty.
Perhaps the foreign body has movement similar to heartbeat and black blood is discharged from the wound, followed by coldness of the limbs and cold sweat, know that death is imminent, and a symptom of the foreign body is if the head is injured, white blood is discharged from the wound.
Incisions that are near the neck cause paralysis, change the color of the affected area and breathe heavily with high pitched breaths, requesting cold air to be blown, if there is a cough it will be close to small wounds and breathing will be very difficult along with severe pain.
All limbs move and if there is a cough, the same will happen with pain that is severe and blood comes out from the wound resembling liver in color, if it is the spleen that is injured it is unlikely for anything other than the spleen to come out from the wound.
If the abdomen is injured and gas escapes and something comes out from the wound or pus or rotten matter, there is no hope in treating it or removing the wound, if the wound is a bladder injury and urine comes out.
If something comes out from the wound and the pain increases on the affected area, it means death has occurred. As for the other limbs such as face, eyes, neck, chest, back, arms, legs, feet, and so forth, they will accept their fate.
If a wound does not cause bleeding or pain, and the wound is not poisoned, I inform you of some cases of similar wounds that can guide you in your treatment, one example being a wound on a man's face near his eye in the nose area.
I have extracted it from the other side, under the outer ear, and he was well. No harm occurred in his eye. I have also extracted a small horn that had happened to a Jew, which was located beneath his lower eyelid. The horn was curved and did not adhere except for its smaller end, which sticks to the bone.
The first horn was large, composed of four pieces of iron without ears, and the Jew was cured and no harm occurred in his eye. I have also extracted a small horn from a Christian's incision, and the horn was round.
He who had ears, I pierced between them and he was wounded in his incision, and I soothed him until I extracted it, and the Christian was cured. I also extracted a small horn from a man who had suffered it in his abdomen, and we expected that he would die from it.
When a period of thirty or so days had passed and nothing changed in his condition, I pierced the horn and it transformed into another form and I extracted it, and he was cured with no harm to him. I also saw a man with a horn on his back, so I made an incision on it.
After seven years, a tumor resembling a seed appeared in the root of a man's leg, and a woman was found to have a seed-like tumor in her abdomen. The tumor and the injury remained, but there was no change in her condition, and she found no harm in any of her natural actions.
You see another man with a tumor on his face and an injury, and there is not much pain for him, and similar cases are many. A seed-like tumor was removed from the nose of a man from the leaders of the state, as it had appeared in the middle of his left nostril slightly.
The tumor was completely removed, and it was advised to treat it after the tumor had appeared for three days. When I examined it with a fine probe, I did not feel anything and he found pain and swelling under his right ear due to the wound.
I hoped that the pain was from the tumor, so I pressed the area with a forceps with strong attraction and stimulated it, expecting it to twitch and show signs of the tumor, but there was no event in the area indicating that the tumor had reached the spot.
The patient has been bandaged for several days, but no event occurred; hence, it was sutured within that wound and the wound healer remained in a state of delay in healing due to its extraction. Afterward, I felt gravel inside his nose one day, so I informed him. Then, I placed a sharp medication (a purgative) on the wound for several days.
Until it opened and discharged, I felt a sharp edge of gravel adhering to the bone. Then, I enlarged the wound with that medication (a purgative) until a sharp edge of gravel appeared to us in the eyes, and he remained for about four months with it.
When the wound was enlarged and beetles were able to enter it, I drew them out with forceps, but they did not respond to my pulling; so I used gentle force without causing him any pain and applied various devices until I captured him one day with strong forceps according to their appearance in the last chapter.
The physicians used to rule that nasal congestion should not be compressed, but I compressed it and applied a snuff that was harmless and did not affect the bone, and I will inform you of the method for extracting some gravel so that this may serve as a measure and guide regarding what I have not mentioned.
The parts and details of this craft cannot be described or contained in a book. Only the skilled artisan, who measures much with little, can grasp what has not been mentioned and create new works and new tools when confronted by strange circumstances.
If you are cut from this craft, I say that the pieces come out of the limbs in two ways: either by pulling them out from the location where you entered or pushing them out from the opposite direction, coming out where they entered.
Either the splinter is located in a soft tissue, where it attracts pus and comes out spontaneously. In that case, you should not attempt to extract it until its surrounding tissue has relaxed, making it easier to pull it out. The same applies if it penetrates bone.
It is not necessary for you to exit (the abscess), leave it also for certain days and continue with drawing and moving it every day, as it will come out. If it is not necessary for you to make it come out after certain days, then pierce around the abscess in the same bone from all sides with a gentle probe until it spreads (the abscess), then draw it and remove it.
If the abscess is found in the bone of the head and it has settled within one of the cranial bones, and any of those symptoms which I have mentioned for you appear, refrain from drawing the abscess and leave it until the situation resolves after certain days.
Hold (the abscess) for drawing and removal, if it is very swollen and you are not able to draw it, use the probes around the abscess as described for you earlier, then treat the location until it heals. As for an abscess that has moved in the body. If the sensation is lost, probe it with a hook; if you feel it, draw it out with one of the devices suitable for doing so. If this cannot be done, make an incision and leave a wide wound, so that the swelling may recede and the wound not become infected, nor should it contain bone, muscle or nerve.
Make an incision on it until the wound widens and allows the pus to drain out. If there are any canals attached, remove the meat surrounding them from all sides using every possible method you can manage. If you cannot completely excise the meat, break the canals and open them up until the meat is freed.
If you attempt to drain the pus in any position, use probes directed towards all sides until it is freed and secure the tip of the probe so that the pus does not break and becomes difficult to draw out or extract, if this proves too hard for you at that time.
Leave it for the duration until the surrounding flesh has softened then resume treatment, as it becomes easier at this point; if you encounter bleeding, use the previously mentioned remedies for that, and preserve your efforts from cutting any nerve or muscle or vein and employ various methods.
You can extract the thorn in every direction, and it should be done with a probe and tweezers, as you have been described, and you must use a finger similar to the shape of the thorn when it was embedded for a better fit.
If you are unable to do that, then use what you can in terms of shapes, and as for the thorn which comes out from the opposite direction, it may either have been pushed out with something from outside or you may find one end of the thorn by touching the skin from above close by and see it protruding.
Break it open as wide as can accommodate the pliers, then draw it out, for it will facilitate its removal. If it has been grasped in a bone, apply pressure with your fingers until the thorn affects the bone and expands, then draw it out.
Leave it for as many days as it persists until it comes out, if the thorn has fallen off and you want to use a probe, introduce the straight instrument into the wound so that it penetrates the depth of the thorn, then apply pressure with it.
If the thorn is straight, apply pressure with an instrument that penetrates into its depth for it will facilitate its removal. If the thorn is poisonous, you must cauterize all the meat around it if possible, then treat it with whatever suits that purpose.
If the tumor is located in the chest, abdomen, diaphragm or flank and it can be approached with a probe and you are able to incise (it), then make an incision and save from cutting any artery or nerve and extract it.
Then, draw the incision line if stitching is required, then treat it until it heals, the picture of the leeches that attract tumors:.
The edges of it are similar to the tip of a bird's beak, it can be made so that it catches a tumor or something else that has not been left behind. It can be made in various sizes, from large to small and medium-sized, all depending on the size of the tumor and its depth and width of the incision.

On the ligature of arteries:.
The arteries that are commonly ligated in the body are thirty arteries, ten of which are located in the head. These include the two pulsating arteries behind the ears known as the carotids and the two arteries in the visible neck veins (carotid and jugular veins) and the two arteries in the eyelids known as the nasal arteries or "observers".
The vein in the middle of the forehead, the vein at the side of the nose, the two veins in the neck, the veins in the upper eye-sockets from the face, the veins in the lower eye-sockets, and these veins are known as the jugular; the veins under the tongue.
The veins which spread in the arm and hand are five, one of them is called the cephalic and it comes from the savage side, commonly known as the head vein or medial cubital vein, and it is a mixture of branches of the basilic and cephalic veins, commonly known as the body vein.
The basilic (also known as the inensal, commonly called body vein or thoracic vein) is located on the inside and it's also known as the saphenous vein. It is found on the calf and it connects to it and appears prominently above the ankle, namely the saphenous vein.
This is the artery that lies between the cuntisor and the piscisor, it has two branches. In the thigh and the leg there are three arteries, one of which is under the backbone from the wild side and the second is the scafin and its location is near the heel from the human side and the female artery and its location is near the elbow from the wild side.
In the other thigh there are also three arteries like it. As for the two arteries behind the ears, they should be cauterized and ligated, and the veins of the forehead that connect and branch off, including the temporal vein, the supraorbital vein, and the vein at the angle of the eye. The method of doing this is as follows.
It is to burn the top of the nose and char it in place of the arteries, then press down on the nose with a clamp until the arteries appear and their location behind the ears in the hollow places on the sides of the head are felt. Then you should probe them with your finger and find where the pulsations from the arteries can be felt under your finger. This is how it is taught.
Then take a curved knife, which is known as the scissors, and insert it under the artery in the skin until it reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the artery and the skin above it and cut the artery together with the skin in a tight incision, and the length of the incision should be equal to two interlocked fingers.
Or take as much blood as desired, then squeeze them (the leeches) with the forceps and leave them until they escape, and if you wish to proceed immediately at the beginning of the book, cut and open them, and regarding the two veins in the temples, it is beneficial to tie them for headache, hard head, persistent nosebleed, and sharp pains directed towards the eyes.
And regarding the method of tying them, first feel for the pulse clearly on your finger and make a note of its location. Then raise the skin from above the pulse to the top with your index finger.
And insert the lancet into the vein from below and raise the pulse to above, then you will make a nick as you did in other pulses and draw blood according to your need, then press down firmly on the artery with your finger for one minute.
Then place a piece of cloth and bandage on it, press down on it firmly and leave it until it escapes, and if you wish to proceed immediately at the beginning of the book, cut and tie them as mentioned earlier, regarding tying the vein of the forehead, it is beneficial after tying the jugular vein for nosebleed, scrofula (tuberculous swelling of the neck), or erysipelas (a bacterial skin infection).
Method of Locating It Upon What You Have Sent Me, the Ill One, He is Struck at His Back with a Probe Until the Pus Appears, Then Take the Instrument Known as the Forceps (Fasa) Whose Image is as Follows:.
Place the probe at the end of the forceps on the pus and strike it from above with a mallet or something similar, then allow the blood to flow as much as you desire, then clean the probe and squeeze it until it is empty.
It should be opened with a wide opening, but not too wide, as the opening should not be sharp like some probes. Instead, it should be slightly rounded to prevent breaking it if it is delicate. Use it in a circular motion.
As for the abscesses located near the eye, they are useful in treating eye diseases such as conjunctivitis and inflammation. The method of locating them is to strike the back of the ill person with a probe, then locate the abscesses while standing on his head, and make a small circular incision with a slightly rounded, small probe.
If the opening is sharp, it may break, so send for blood and place a bandage over it, then press them for a night and clean them, and if you want to locate abscesses under the eyelids, they are useful in treating acute inflammation.
A severe skull fracture is one of the facial ailments such as the red swelling (sufa'ah) that appears in the nose, especially when it has been closed. The method of treatment: press strongly on the skull, then grasp the nostril with your left hand and take a thin, long probe.
Pierce it in the middle of the nose between the nostrils where there is no sensation, as the pain will not be felt there, and blood will flow from its time. It is advisable to grip the probe slightly with your hand and send some blood, then tie it up overnight, as it will burst quickly.
As for the boils, it is beneficial to drain them in order to relieve the soul and treat the swellings that appear on the skin such as blackheads, pustules, red blisters, abscesses, and ulcers. The method of draining: press strongly below them on their neck with a strap and let the maker stand on top of the boil.
The patient sits on a chair, then the bloodletting is performed by extending the incision wide and deep enough to let out the required amount of blood or according to the need seen at the time. Then this process is repeated with the other incision before removing the strap.
The veins are tied firmly in the middle so that they do not burst, and leaving them until tomorrow is beneficial because it helps in healing wounds, as for the veins of the neck, it is useful to tie them after tying the carotid arteries since this helps with head injuries, fractures, nosebleeds, eye injuries, and nosebleeds.
Place the patient in a sitting position and tie his neck strongly with a cord, then turn his head to the side where you can see one of the veins on the right side of the eye and the second on the left side of the eye, and pierce them both with a lancet.
Also, it is to be noted that there are veins around them which should be ligated firmly and then cut, if you are unsure of their identity, aim for the larger one and the smaller one, and make a cut in the veins in the lower eyelid.
As for the veins beneath the tongue, it is beneficial to tie them after tying the carotid arteries, as this helps in treating diseases of the neck and mouth, and the method to tie them is to have the patient sit with his head between your knees, raise his tongue, look under the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for another vein and press both until they turn blue.
Separate and preserve them (the three veins), for it is not beneficial to cut them, as beneath them are the arteries. In case a flow of blood appears from these arteries, beware that they should not be cut. As for the three veins found in the arm, it has become customary among people to separate them on both sides.
May be stitched with a broad needle or olive wood needle to the arm, or may be cut open with a skinning knife and this is the vein [here is its image], Vein Image: Broad Arm Needle Stitching.
Should be as wide as you see, to open the oblique veins full of thick blood that contains a lot of clots and appears rough on the surface, this is the olive wood needle [here is its image]. Vein Image: Olive Wood Needle Stitching.
This needle is narrower and sharper on both sides, suitable for separating the small veins containing thin pale blood, this is the skinning knife [here is its image]. Vein Image: Skinning Knife Stitching.
This skinning knife, which is suitable for cutting and comes in various sizes and thicknesses according to the size and narrowness of the veins, can be used instead of others and it is well-known among craftsmen.
In English: "Regarding the pulsation, which is one of these three veins, it is beneficial to tie it as it draws blood from the places that are under the neck and chest, and abdomen. The person who ties it should be careful, for underneath it there are arteries. If he makes a mistake and adds in the tying of the vein, he cuts that artery.
In English: "It is not desirable to tie the pulsation (vein), but rather it should be cut with a scalpel if it cannot be seen clearly. If the pulsation does not appear clearly, it should be avoided and an alternative vein or a different method should be sought.
In English: "Or tie the location of the arm vein, for it is clear and cut it with a scalpel as we said earlier. If you wish to tie it directly, you must first find its location until the pulsation is known, then learn about it through ligature.
In English: "Then tie the arm and cut the vein with a scalpel as we said, and ensure that the blow is at a distance from the arteries. Whenever you see during your tying that there is a swelling in the place you learned about ligature, that swelling is an expansion of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see blood during the operation, it clots like newborn's urine and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from arterial blood. In such a case, press firmly with your finger for a long time, then remove your finger. If the blood does not break easily, it is a bone fracture.
Leave it and warn the patient not to move it for days until it heals, unless the blood does not stop flowing and you do not feel any pain while you are there, then open the artery if it appears to you because its sides will contract and the blood will clot.
Take a piece of bark and cut it thinly, then take one half and press it firmly on the location of the artery with a tight bandage for several days. If the blood does not stop flowing, treat it with what has been mentioned about the position of binding bands to stop bleeding, and cutting the blood does not require much effort in most cases.
For a small wound where bandaging is possible in the arm, note that it is beneficial to tie it, but as for the vein of the elbow, it is useful to locate it so that blood may flow from the head and lower body to its location because it is composed of branches from the basilic vein and branches from the cephalic vein as we have mentioned.
The (surgeon) should have the ability to palpate the plexus under his incision, for if it increases in size and hits the pleura, it may cause a pus-like substance that makes breathing difficult and may not discharge naturally; this plexus often appears to touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is delicate and not clear, make your incision more shallow with the lancet and avoid the plexus; for if there is a nerve between two plexuses, cut the nerve lengthwise. As for the superficial nerve, it is beneficial to incise it as it attracts blood from the head.
It is beneficial for the treatment of eye diseases to incise this nerve; either with a zitoun clyster or a broad rihan clyster, because all nerves submit to it as there are no veins nor plexus under it.
Except that when incising, you should avoid the head of the vertebra with the clyster and seek a suitable position; it will not be harmed even if it is not hit by the first blow. However, some people may have pain if they are not incised in the first blow; it is possible for them to be irritated.
But the worm does not harm him at all, as for the method of extraction and its risks, and what should be done before addressing it in repair, first it is necessary to know that extraction is either used only to preserve health.
If it is used in diseases or for preserving and maintaining health and warding off diseases, then extraction should be performed in one of the three veins that are in the arm, namely the cephalic, the basilic, or the median cubital, and extraction should be done at the beginning of spring if signs of congestion appear.
The extraction should be done on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours have passed, and as for the extraction that is used for diseases, it has no specific time but whenever the need and necessity arises, whether day or night.
In every hour and at every time, it is not appropriate to extract children until they reach fourteen years of age, and it is also not appropriate to extract the elderly who have exceeded sixty years, so if anyone needs extraction for any reason, it can be done.
It is necessary to clean the patient's arm before extraction, if there is excessive pus in it, so that it does not attract to the veins during extraction which causes swelling and harm to the main limbs, and it is not appropriate to extract a drunk person, a diabetic or someone with jaundice until that condition ceases.
"Be aware of causing damage after hemorrhoid, ulcer, abscess and fracture, or an increase in physical exertion, fatigue, sports, alcohol consumption, fasting, and anything that may weaken the body physically or mentally. Before this, examine the quality of the blood if it is thick.
"With food, drinks and medications if possible, then enter the bathhouse unless prevented by a prohibition or he desires some exercise to make the blood warm and facilitate its flow in the daytime, as we have said, and to prevent it from thickening that day from all harmful psychological factors.
"As in the case of fear, anger, and panic, as well as all bodily factors such as fatigue, strain, excessive physical exertion, and similar things, and to prepare all items that are commonly used for goodwill, fresh air, and incense, each person should do so according to their ability.
"Then, the patient with a hernia should sit on an elevated stool higher than the one used for the herniated area, then he should raise his arm and massage the hernia twice or three times with his hand, then tighten the belt and pull it twice or three times, making the tension moderate.
If the cut is not straight, either by excess in cutting or by pressing, it prevents the flow of blood; and if it is too shallow, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then after the cut, it is necessary to press all the edges with one another.
Until the veins expand and become visible, then he should gently wipe the wounded area with pure oil specifically, then he should place his left thumb under the same vein where he wants to tie it lightly so as not to damage the vein. Because some veins are like water and they tear when tied, and others are filled with gas. When the ligature is placed on them, they sink under it and the vein contracts and does not open. If it opens, it only opens tightly.
Therefore, the ligature should be firmly tied and he should be careful in these matters, then he should release the ligature. If the vein opens at its passage, or he should try again in that position slightly lower or higher with a needle if the position does not swell.
If the ligature causes pain or swelling, leave it for a day or two and do not tie the ligature again, as it may cause severe pain and infection, and does not enter the wound. Then try tying again if desired, and if the ligature is tied and the opening is small and blood flow is slight.
I fear that the quantity of blood you desire may not come out, so prepare the vein in the incision carefully and increase slightly in opening it. Do this with a lancet before the place becomes inflamed, for indeed, in many people, the place becomes inflamed at a small incision.
If you see it becoming inflamed, do not press on it as it will not benefit you and put something from oil of turpentine on it, for it eases the flow of blood and is better in this situation than the oil itself and other ointments.
Use oil of turpentine in all your blood-letting places when the flow of blood is obstructed, for it can help relieve the obstruction and dissolve the coagulated blood if any of them are placed on the spot, for the blood will liquefy and flow.
If something happens in the blood-letting place and there is a large swelling, it often happens to those who have not drained it except for that one time or if the incision was small, so put on the swelling an esponge soaked in water and salt, tightly pressed for an hour, for it will dissolve.
It should be done after the blood has completely left the wound, either from the same wound or another one. If it remains in the same place for several days and turns black or green, it does not harm. If you wish, apply something with astringent and healing properties to it.
Apply something from the juice of walnut or similar, as pus and swelling often occur after the extraction of a boil. Place your hand on it if you find it and squeeze gently, but be careful not to cause harm. Avoid putting anything on it that we have mentioned earlier.
Leave it to set with a binding substance to harden the area, then treat it with various treatments until it heals. It is important that each person let out blood in proportion to their strength and the predominant color of their blood.
If the blood is black, let it come out until it turns red. Similarly, if you see it thick, send for it to be drawn out until it becomes thin. Also, if it is hard, let it go until its edge disappears. It is important for those who are strong and need to let out blood to do so in one session.
Expand the incision to expose the artery, and ensure that the muscle is stretched out. If it is weak, apply pressure on it, and it should be removed in layers. The wound should be tight. The best tool for exposing the artery is a sharp, curved instrument without serrations.
This blow is suitable for both incision and amputation; it is Ahmad or Aslam. In exposing the artery, extension and length are important. If one frequently performs incisions, it is advisable to anesthetize before the procedure using bread soaked in hot water or skunk fat.
If the instrument is sharp and removes blood in three or four layers, and the patient's circulation improves, then before the incision, take bread soaked in mepytic juice or sweet wine containing aromatics or in good rose-scented liquor.
If anesthesia occurs during incision due to excessive bleeding, it is necessary to drink meat broth and rose-scented, fine liquor. Use aromatics, fill his chest with them, and use all the substances mentioned in the section on anesthetics.
"If it is a case of fistula, but one intends to dilate the ulna and make the blood flow more freely in the second vein, then for those with a large and weak fistula, it should be gradually dilated according to the strength, in nearby days.
"But if one intends to dilate the ulna and make the blood flow more freely in the second vein, and his body is strong, it should be done after seven or nine hours from the first incision. If someone wishes to draw blood from his body to the side that was punctured, he should go on the second or third day.
"But if there is much blood in his body that has clotted and hardened and caused inflammation, it should be drawn out in one dose, and a large amount should come out, expanding the incision to expose the affected area after it has become clean according to all the conditions of incision. "And one should place his hand on the pulsation during bleeding to prevent death at the affected area, as this rarely occurs if the incision is well-known and there is no negligence or error. However, it should not be done if you intend to cure the ulna and make the blood flow more freely in the second vein.
If the artery of the forehead is blocked and the blood cannot be evacuated, it should not be pressed firmly or rubbed strongly. Rather, either leave it until it discharges itself, or cut it with a scalpel without causing much bleeding in the forehead.
If salt is dissolved in water and applied to it, or if a poultice of Faruq tar or Shakhzanaia is applied and pressed gently until the blood comes out, it should be left if the forehead is swollen.
Leave it until the pain subsides, if it is necessary to evacuate the blood, either let it discharge in that location or in another part of the body or forehead.
If a splint of willow or poplar is not available or hidden because it is compounded from them, the method for evacuating it is that the patient should immerse his hand in hot water until the vein becomes red and the forehead appears swollen clearly, then press gently but firmly on it with a rope.
Then, the forehead is to be gently twisted in a rotating motion without stretching or pulling and the opening should be wide. Your instrument should be placed above the wrist slightly for ease of blood evacuation. If there is difficulty in extracting the blood, immerse the hand again in hot water and let the blood flow freely in the water.
Until your need arises, if you are in summer days, avoid resetting the hand in hot water and anything that makes blood flow in hot water during winter time. This vessel (hand) should be preserved from all vessels (bodies). Since there is no nerve or bone under it, as for the procedure of releasing the tendon from the left hand, it is beneficial for kidney stones and the method is to tighten the hand with rope or your hand after putting it in hot water until the vessel (tendon) swells.
Since there is no nerve or bone under it, as for the procedure of releasing the tendon from the left hand, it is beneficial for kidney stones and the method is to tighten the hand with rope or your hand after putting it in hot water until the vessel (tendon) swells. It is clearly felt and then released with a slight twist, even if it slips off completely, it does not harm him at all. Keep the hand in place since there is a bone of the fingers under it and the position can be seen from the flesh, then return the hand to hot water.
Leave it to let the blood flow in it, if you do not put it back in hot water, the blood will coagulate in the vessel (tendon) and prevent the flow. If you have extracted as much blood as needed, apply oil and salt to the tendon so that it does not adhere quickly.
Similarly, it is necessary to do the same for each tight vessel. As for the benefit of releasing it from the left hand, it is beneficial for gallstones and similarly do as you did in the second case. As for releasing the inguinal hernia, it is also beneficial for diseases located below the abdomen such as those affecting the ovaries.
Touching (or examination of) testicles, kidney diseases, and fistulas in legs and anuses, as well as similar conditions, and their treatment: a man should immerse himself in hot water, then press gently with the probe until the vessels dilate. Then he should push it above the male organ's division and position it near the anus, visible like a thumb.
From the penis of a man, many hairs should be removed. Remove it in the wider area or near the anus where it is better and more comfortable. If you remove it from the penis, you will protect the veins that lie beneath it on the surface of the penis.
Make your incision (or cut) for him as if you are trying to draw a vein, and let the probe be like a needle. If there is difficulty in getting out the blood, the man should immerse himself in hot water and let the blood flow in it until it drains completely. If the probe accidentally pierces the vessel at first attempt.
It should be excised slightly above, for the place is safe and not afraid of it by thieves if you keep it from the nerve as we mentioned, and also do the same with the scrotum of another man or woman, and regarding a woman's armpit, its location is as we said on the side of the armpit near the armpit hair.
It is beneficial to excise it for the ulcer of the scrotum if it is due to hot blood, and its method is that you insert a hot iron into it and hasten it, pushing it from the root of the scrotum to above the navel with four fingers, with a thin, long forceps. It does not show otherwise.
If it appears, excise it in any condition, either by turning it (meaning twisting the wound) which is better, or by breaking it with a pumice stone or crushing it with forceps, for its location is safe and it is often hidden from people.
If it is not felt by touch, excise a part of its shaft, which is the one that appears on the surface of the foot around the ankle and toe, and keep it from nerves and send out blood of the desired amount.
Then, the wound is closed and a linen cloth is placed on the site of excision, and the site is tightened quickly, for it heals rapidly.
Chapter Sixty and Ninety.
On Suturing and its Application.
Sutures can be made from threads, wood, brass, or glass. Suturing with the condition of draining blood and without it.
This suturing without condition is done on two types.
The sutures for the ears are two sheets of the neck from both sides, the suture for the nose is below the lower jaw under the mouth, the sutures for the arms (kuffayn) are the shoulder, the sutures for the elbows ('assas) are at the elbow joint, the sutures for the legs (zendin) are in the middle of the arm pits, and the sutures for the ankles (saqin) and the sacrosciatic ligaments (arquobayn).
Suturing draws blood from the tense vessels in the meat, for this reason, it is not allowed to drop the power of constriction and suturing with fire or without it should not be done in any of the diseases that are related to obstruction until the body has completely evacuated.
If the need arises for suturing, whether from a patient or due to habit, we employ it at all times: in the beginning, middle, and end of the month, as well as anytime in between.
Some people find that they have an excess of blood which necessitates its removal by suturing. They may experience heaviness and pain in the head, and some may develop swelling on the face and head as well as the neck. Others might have ulcers on their faces or eyes, or suffer from blindness or cataracts, in which case they would require suturing.
Some people have excessive laughter, while others may find a taste of blood in their mouths and teeth grinding. Some may bleed excessively, have prolonged sleep, or see blood and redness during their dreams, as well as nightmares, surgeries, and similar phenomena. We have rarely seen anything like this.
In particular, it is our custom in the middle of the month to perform suturing after a lapse of two or three hours from noon, and as for stitching the wound, it relieves heaviness on the head and prevents fluid accumulation around the eyes.
But it should be done after the evacuation of the abdomen, and this incision may be a cause for the leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid. It is advisable not to use it if the patient has a cold brain or if there is a drop in it, as it will harm him greatly.
It is not advisable for the experienced practitioners to use it, and for those who have diseases in the brain, and for those who are subjected to it, may suffer from forgetfulness.
Therefore, the incision should be ordered to withdraw his hand slightly downwards, for fear of causing forgetfulness, and as for the incision in the neck, it is a cause for the leakage of bile and pus.
Therefore, it is beneficial to use narcotics and to restrict the soul, tighten the respirator, relax, and fill the chest. It is advisable to raise the incision in the neck slightly as if it descends, it will cause weakness in the heart and diaphragm.
And as for the incision of the temples, it is beneficial for treating wounds on the head, swelling, and fractures, and it is a cause for the leakage of pus. It is advisable that the incision is not too deep, so as not to cut the nerves, in case of bleeding.
As for suturing below the eyelid, it is beneficial for eye disorders and similar ailments in the eye, and a position can be assumed to remove a cataract that is in the eyes. And as for suturing of the chest, it is beneficial from the suckling cups which will be from milk supply and heat.
As for suturing the abdomen, it is beneficial to remove three arteries, al-basleeq, al-aakhil and al-qeefal because they attract blood from all the sharp arteries in the flesh, and those sharp arteries are attracted by another artery that is stronger than them until it reaches the three strong arteries.
It is necessary to command the suturer not to operate in a case where the location is visible and beneath it there are disorders and lesions, and as for a single suture that sews up an ulcer, it is beneficial from veins of the feet and vessels of the lower part.
It is necessary to command the suturer that the suture should be large and made of copper as the location requires a strong bandage, and perhaps the suture of glass may break and it depends greatly on conditions, and as for sutures for milk supply, it reduces the milk supply slightly.
Since it attracts blood from the entire body and is beneficial for abscesses in the kidneys, urinary bladder, and urethra, it cauterizes and is beneficial for boils and dimples, except that it harms the body greatly and causes poisoning in most people. The benefits of cauterizing the anus and rectum are close to the benefits of circumcision.
The method of placing the cautery is to place it first empty, and it should be held vertically and not too long. Then, you quickly place the cautery and quickly remove it so that the mixture can accept it evenly, without lingering. Repeat this and wait until the area turns red and opens.
The redness of the blood appeared, then it was necessary to press and repeatedly repeat the movement. If one of the people had meat that was torn apart in the wound, it was necessary to cauterize only once, lest it tear the area further.
The circumciser is ordered to widen the pressure and penetrate slightly, moving gently. If there was coagulated blood in it, it was necessary to press twice. In the first case, it should open a path for the gentle flow of blood and its water, and in the second, no extraction of the coagulated blood.
If the blood is very thick, it should be repeated thrice to reach its goal. If we want to remove a little blood, one condition will suffice. However, if we desire to remove much blood, our conditions increase, and if we are capable that the blood is thick.
It is necessary to set conditions deeply and the limit of the condition should be only the depth of the skin, it is not appropriate to use pliers or water when placing the clamp, nor anything that may harm the one being held. As for those whose skin is thick, hard, rough and tight.
It is necessary to lubricate the sites of the clamps with unguents that are smooth, soft and odorless. For example, if it is during summer, use oils like almond oil or benzoin oil or sweet almond oil or rose oil or pomegranate oil or oil of cinnamon.
If it is during the winter, use unguents like castor oil or sesame oil or camphor oil or juniper and similar. If the wound is cold and hard, use oils like mustard oil or linseed oil or poppy seed oil or soap nut oil.
If the wound is wide and the incision deep into the flesh, it is recommended to abstain from oil. Those affected should wash their wounds after suturing with warm water or cold water or with leek water or radish water or with linseed water or similar. As for those whose blood is excessively wet.
Wash the wounds with vinegar or camel urine and similar, and for those whose pus is thick, wash the wounds with sour milk or water of onion juice or leek water or similar. It is recommended to avoid suturing in the bath or near the bath.
Wait for an hour or two after leaving the bath and no one should sleep after suturing, it is not permissible to talk to the wounded person before or after suturing.
Take cold poultices such as leeches, hawksbill turtle shells, dried walnuts and almonds, skinks and similar, and make him eat fried garlic and veal kidneys, lamb stomachs and similar.
If a person is constipated, it is necessary to give him honey wine or mibatha or skenjabin azur and he should consume moderately aged perfumed vinegar which is between the old and the new, and he should be ordered to eat little food and his food should consist of fararij, qanabir, asafir and hamam's pigeons (white doves), and it is necessary that the drink on the day of surgery and evacuation be more than the food.
It is necessary to give some people tariq al-faruq or elixir of musk or shilthaa before surgery and evacuation, or after them, to strengthen the main organs, stimulate the blood and it should not be given to alcoholics.
The incisions without conditions are the ones that are made on the liver, spleen, lungs, abdomen, intestines, kidneys, and the rectum because these organs do not require any conditions, rather it is aimed at drawing blood from one organ to another.
We make an incision on the lungs in case of a pneumothorax or to release air from the organ because there is a pleural effusion in the organ, we make an incision on the abdomen and intestines as it relieves the organ and heats it and draws out the inflammation.
If a stone or gravel appears in the kidney, it can be drawn out by strong pulling, thereby opening the stone or extracting it from its place. Similarly, this is done if placed on the liver and spleen when wind gathers therein. These instruments are used empty, with nothing but oil.
The probe is heated or filled with boiling water for the extraction of bladder stones, and this is done by filling the instrument with hot water or water that has been cooked with certain herbs suitable for this purpose.
Then, the filled probe is placed at the location and held in place, then repeatedly applied according to necessity, and this is a photograph of the instrument used for extraction with fire:.
The instrument should have two openings, one larger and the other smaller, with a depth of half a finger, and on its side, there should be a small hole just large enough for a wire to pass through, made from Chinese brass or yellow copper, well polished.
A flat plane, well-rounded so as not to harm the organ when placed upon it, and in its center there should be a stiff wire made of copper or iron where the bladder is heated with fire. This instrument can be large or small depending on the disease.
We shall employ them (cauterization instruments), for the ulcers of children and women are not those of men and adults; as for the manner of placing this cauterization in fire on the limb, it is to heat a filament of steel or a small piece of charcoal from a brazier and place it on the center of the suspended pole which is in the middle of the cauterization.
Make the ascent of fire almost below the cauterization to prevent burning the patient, then place it on the limb and finger on the hole we mentioned until we grasp the cauterization without causing pain, then remove the finger.
The boil comes out on that hole and the cauterization stays in place, then a filament is drawn along the edge and returned if necessary; as for the cauterization used in scrotal water disease, it has no suspended pole or hole.
It is used by filling with water and placing it on the limb only, and this is its image:.
This cauterization, whenever it was large enough to hold a lot of water, was better.
The seventh and ninety-ninth section.
On the ligature (of veins).
The ulcer is mostly used in the majority of cases in the limbs that cannot accommodate sutures, either because of its small size like the eyelid and nose or because the limb is exposed to meat like fingers and nostrils and similar parts.
The method of using the ulcer should aim at obtaining pure distilled water from the pustules, then leaving it for a day and night in salty water until it ferments and nothing remains inside it. Then the body is emptied first by cupping or suturing, then the affected limb is cleaned.
Leave it to turn red, then put it on the affected area. If it adheres and falls off, that is better; otherwise, wash the spot with soap, then with plenty of water and salt, and squeeze it. If pus comes out after the ulcer falls off, that is a good sign. Dip a piece of cedar wood in cold water.
Place it from above until the artery is severed, if blood flows abundantly, pour on it a powder or a piece of cotton or similar items from the cauterizing irons until the bleeding stops or apply tourniquets to the place of incision.
Leave it until the ligature adheres to the place, for the blood will stop flowing. If it is necessary to reapply the ligature, do not use that ligature again unless there is no other option; if you cannot avoid using the same ligature, clean the site with pig's blood.
Insert a probe into the wound until something from the blood emerges, then place it [the probe]. If it feels something of the blood adhering to it, let it remain at the site; if you want to remove it, sprinkle something from ashes or salt or charcoal on it, and it will fall off onto the site.
Third Chapter.
On algebra.
This chapter is also relevant to the craft of medicine and deals with fracture algebra, a term used for analyzing the angles formed by fractured bones.
Be aware, my sons, that this chapter may be considered foolish by physicians and the common people; those who have not even read a book on medicine or understood a single letter of it.
For this art, the science has become famous in our country without any fault of my penmanship. I have benefited from it as much as my reading of the early books allowed me and I have endeavored to understand them, until I extracted that knowledge from them. Then I insisted on practice and training for the length of my life.
I have drawn for you in this chapter all that is covered by the knowledge. I have experimented with it after approaching it for you, refined it from the long-winded and shortened it to its essence, made it clear to the highest degree, and illustrated for you in it many images of the machines that are used in it.
It is an addition to the explanation as you did in the preceding chapters, and there is no power except by Allah the Exalted.
The first section.
In it, the fundamentals of breaking bones and their presentation are gathered together before we begin to mention the broken and dislocated parts one by one. Therefore, in this chapter, it is necessary to summarize the discourse and outline its sections. It is essential for you to understand and remain steadfast on the truth that you and those who are eager to learn this noble craft are not alike.
It should be done immediately when something breaks or dislocates or fractures or falls in; first to locate it, or to reduce it, or both of them at once. Nor should anything prevent from doing so, like weakness of strength, or the one that happened to it was a child or an old man, or the time is very hot or very cold.
Then he should restrict his diet to cold foods like bird's meat and mutton, avoid alcohol and tough meats, abstain from overeating, and let every food fill the veins with blood until the wound is safe and there is no fear of infection by any material into the place.
Then the cause should return to its original management, if the broken bone is set in plaster, the patient should eat foods that strengthen much and nourishing, which contains pairs like barley and wheat and beans and pulses and corn meal of cow or goat. And egg, lean meat, strong drink and suchlike, for this management makes the setting of the fracture quicker and better; and know that broken bones in men who are vigorous or old cannot be joined and united back to their original nature forever.
Fractured bones become soft and brittle, and the fragments may connect or interlock. However, nature causes a layer similar to callus on all sides of the broken bone. But, it is stronger than the original bone and can resist pressure until it heals completely by joining with each other.
They connect until they reach maximum strength and hardness, just like before, so that nothing can harm them.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide the patient with food containing nourishment and energy, as well as building materials, as we said earlier. It should be noted that fractures can vary in type depending on the affected bone because a fracture of the hand bone differs from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the rib differs from a fracture of the backbone.
Similarly, each and every bone is different from the others. We will discuss each type of fracture separately, and it is possible that the type of bone fracture can also differ within itself.
Because it may be a crushing fracture without the occurrence of fragments, or a fracture along the length of the bone with fragments and broken pieces in it, or a fracture accompanied by injury to the skin and wound, or a simple clean fracture.
For each type of fracture, there is a specific method in setting it where its description will be detailed at its place, and what is known as bone fracture is characterized by swelling, displacement, appearance for feeling, trembling when you touch it with your hand.
If there is no swelling, trembling or feeling of bone when touched with pain and the cause is not apparent and there is no discomfort, it is not a fracture but it may be a sprain or a simple fracture here or a strain, in which case it should not be moved or probed.
But carry medicines that will be mentioned later when the place conforms, then press it gently but firmly, and know that if bone is crushed and displaced without any protrusion, except for fragments, then all parts have separated from their owner.
It is necessary for you to proceed to set and align it before it develops a hot swelling, for if a hot swelling occurs, leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in any way you are able using forceps or other method.
Know that the dislocation and its reduction is easier than a bone which has fractured, then pressure shall be applied on what will be described afterwards. If there is a bone with fractures within it, it is necessary to divide the limb from both sides, whether it is an arm or a leg.
If the limb is small, tie it with two ropes or hold it with a rope and hand; position your limb in its natural position until the broken parts of the bone extend. Then form a reduction by placing the ropes in their respective positions from all sides as much as you can manage with pliers and forceps.
Strive not to cause the patient pain, harm, or distress by your efforts, and strive to fix one of the bones with its partner in the best possible position. At this time, touch and press them both with your hand if you see anything unusual there; correct and reduce it within your ability.
Be aware of severe pressure and excessive force, as many ignorant people often cause this and frequently produce heat or swelling in the limb as you have observed from their actions repeatedly.
Then, after setting and securing it, he should keep that limb immobile and quiet, warning not to move it during his wakefulness and sleep, and in case of change or agitation, and upon any sign of swelling. All movements should be aimed at stretching and extending it, and it should be allowed to regain its position as long as the pain persists.
In case the limb is set with pain or discomfort, it should not be moved from its position to another where there is no pain, but rather it should be allowed to remain in that position as long as there is no further pain or discomfort.
To prevent any joint problems when setting a broken limb, know that the nature and size of broken bones varies. Those which are smaller such as fingers, toes, or tendons should be set in the following manner:... (The rest of the text is about the specific method for setting small bones)
For fractures in the long bones such as arms, legs or chest, it is necessary that the bones be aligned straight because the wide ligament requires a large bone and provides firm immobilization from all sides without any gap.
then, after the gap from the setting (of the fracture), you should apply the appropriate plaster. in a soft puffy swelling on the site of the fracture, then begin to wrap at the site of the fracture itself with three or four layers according to what the limb deserves and press slightly on the bandage, then take it to the upper part of the site of the fracture.
press less than your usual pressure on the fracture site, then move away from the fracture with the wrapping a little and gradually release the pressure until you take something suitable from the correct position, then take another splint and wrap it also on the fracture site.
wrap (it) and go to the lower part of the fracture, and your action should be in pressing and tightening as we have mentioned in the first upper wrapping, then place between the layers from the soft swelling or swelling what is equal to the deformity of the fracture.
if there is deformity (in the fracture) and otherwise do not make anything, then take another splint, then set according to these firm layers of your time, if there is no gas or fever in the limb.
If there is pus or heat in it, press on that part what cures the abscess, let it go with the pus and leave it for some days then tighten (the wound) when the abscess is ripe. The abscess should be made from half a walnut-sized piece of rounded, smooth wood or it can be made from wood of the grater.
The abscess should be made from walnut, date-pits, charcoal or clay and shaped as the illustration shows. Each abscess cavity should be of this shape and form.
The abscess placed on the fracture should be slightly concave and less curved than other abscesses, and as for the length of the abscess, it is made to fit the size of the broken part, whether large or small, illustration of the abscess:.
Then tighten another abscess on the first one according to your initial tightening and then bind from above with strong threads according to what was previously described, namely that the tightening should be at the fracture site stronger than elsewhere. And wherever there is a distance from the fracture, the tightening will be less.
The threads should be moderately tight and the thread made of wet camel hair, because threads that are stiff like what you have seen from ignorance, make their threads from split camel hairs which is a great mistake.
The fracture occurs outside the scope of adjustment and the string sutures are also unsuitable, because you do not achieve with it what you want, and it is not advisable for the gap between the jaws to be less than a finger's width.
If the fracture occurs at the edges of the jaws after setting, then make soft catgut or rolled silk underneath it so that it does not harm anything from that, and if the break occurs with a wound in the skin, we will discuss it separately.
Know that not every fractured bone needs to be set with the jaws from the first day, and this is because if the bone is large, it is not advisable to place the jaws on it except after five or seven days, or more, depending on your safety from developing a hot fever.
This is the property of plasters that were required for the early stages placed on fractures and wounds, a general property of plaster that presses the fracture and heals well, and it is not suitable for children or women because it does not resist heat or cold.
Take from the millstone dust, which is the door of flour that adheres in the mortar of the mill when it rotates, grind it as you would with any other flour but do not sift it with white egg and make the dough neither soft nor hard, then knead it.
A broken and cracked tooth, a decayed tooth or a rotten one, as well as a tooth with a cavity or a carious one, from each of these ten dinars, then wait and endure for five dinars, and from al-Armani clay or Roman clay twenty dinars. Grind all (the ingredients) and mix with the alkali water or white egg if the consistency is fluid, then use this paste because it is good for healing broken bones quickly and it benefits most people when applied to them.
A broken or decayed tooth paste, crushed white marl, white wheat flour, white chalk, and Armani clay are taken in equal parts, ten dinars each, wait and endure for five dinars, grind it finely, mix with water or white egg, and use.
Excerpt for the dressing of dislocated joints and movable bones: It settles in their places, accommodates the wound and bone fracture. The soft cloth is taken, immersed in oil and lard, placed at the site; this dressing does not have forceful strength.
A second type of dressing is for the treatment of hot inflammation and the draining of wounds, specifically. The second dressing exerts force on a broken bone. This dressing is made by pounding together bayberry leaves and paper from the khashkhash tree, then moistening them with water. The shortened dressing is used for setting a fractured bone.
The remedy for a wound is made from the root of the castor-oil plant, beebread, poppy seeds and crushed barley. All are ground together until they form a paste. If the limb is not broken, it should be applied as is. If the limb is broken, it can be mixed with water or water of kuzbara instead.
The third type of dressing is stronger than the first, and it is used when a severe inflammation occurs due to bone fracture. It consists of the root of castor-oil plant, mulberry leaves, opium poppy juice, the milk of roses, marshmallow, barley straw, beebread, and beebalm. Each ingredient is ground separately until they form a paste.
Every joint and fractured bone should be reduced, whether with warm water or cold water or by setting it in plaster. However, he did not mention in his book that a bandage should be placed on the fractured limb during manipulation.
The quirkot is made from lard and oil, and it should be of a moderate consistency between hardness and softness. Regarding the jawineus, he suggested placing items containing softness along with something warm such as mustard, pepper, white lead, and similar substances on the fractured limb during manipulation.
A suitable dressing is beneficial for wounds and pain, it is made from a cotton cloth and chickpea flour, human hair or feathers of birds and clay, along with salt. As for the amount that should remain tied, it is not specified.
Then, if there is no cause for pain or swelling and the fractured bone does not move from its place, it should not be opened. If it happens in its position, there is severe swelling or intense pain or air gets in.
If there is a dislocation, it should be opened immediately and the dressing removed from it, then take soft cotton or sponge with warm water and wash the area until the swelling subsides and the pain goes away, then leave the limb to rest for an hour.
Then apply the warm wool bandage soaked in oil or lard onto it, tie it up overnight until the hot inflammation calms down and the swelling subsides, then return it to the delicate pressure and soft padding, do not tighten it with your initial force.
Then allow it to heal, if you see that the inflammation, redness, pain, swelling and all symptoms have completely subsided and have returned to the soft padding and gentle pressure, then return it as you initially did. If nothing abnormal happens in the limb, leave it as it is.
Do not remove it until after three, four or five, or seven days; it may last up to twenty days, depending on the limb's condition as we mentioned earlier, until there is a necessity for amputation and approaching the muscle.
Increase the pressure and tightening as before, and increase also in the hardening of the plaster according to what you described, if you see the site of the fracture has become loose and more than necessary, know that the plaster should be prevented from reaching it.
Leave the limb in warm water every time you remove the plaster, and let it be done every three days and reduce the pressure slightly; with this action the nourishment will reach the limb and it will heal quickly. As for what the ignorant do among the forced ones in fracturing the limb again.
If [the surgeon] does not initially press where it should be pressed and then presses on a swelling, this is an error committed by them and a grave mistake. Even if it were correct to mention it in their books, no evidence of its effect can be seen from any of them in this matter - the cauterization. The correct action is not to perform it [cauterization].
The second section.
On the fracture at right angles in the head.
Types and shapes of right-angled fractures in the head are numerous, their causes varied, and their origins complex. The fracture may be due to a sword blow or it may be that the bone is broken all the way down to the scull beneath the bone. As when splitting wood.
And therefore this type of fracture is called a splitting fracture, or it may be a sword cut through some bone but not all the way through and it is called a simple fracture in general. The injury caused by these two types of fractures may be severe or minor.
The fracture may be a simple or compound one, and its cause is a blow with a stone or falling on a stone or similar circumstances. This fracture can either be an opening one which penetrates the soft tissue beneath the bone, or it can occur on the face of the bone.
These fractures may also be either large or small, and one type of fracture can occur hidden within the bone in the scalp area and is a simple, easy break.
This type of fracture is called "hairline" because it can occur due to a fall or strike with a stone and enter the bone surface from the outside, leaving a shallow indentation as if exposed to corrosion by copper when struck, part of which enters into the inner area.
It is mostly found in the soft bones of the skull, such as those of children. These fractures can be simple or compound, and we will discuss their treatment in their respective sections. All these types of fractures are identified through examination.
They are examined using probes and the removal of rotten flesh from them, and as for the hairline fracture, it is recognized by palpation of the bone, rubbing and pressing on it, because the fracture appears black. As for the treatment of the fracture, first consider the symptoms of the injury.
If you see symptoms that indicate fear, such as sweating, shaking, fainting, loss of intellect, voice loss, shyness, sharp crying, eye bulging and reddening, or similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him. For in most cases, death occurs with these symptoms. There is no remedy.
If you see symptoms that indicate safety, then treat him. This is because if the injured person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and this was in the cold days.
It is necessary to try to remove the bone before the tenth day in all cases, even if it is in the summer. However, it is necessary to hurry up in removing the bone before the seventh day before what lies under the bone can be spoiled and these symptoms described occur.
If the bone is broken and has reached the spoiled marrow on the skull and there is bleeding and swelling, then it is necessary to cut the damaged part that I have described for you, which is to shave the head of the injured person.
Uncover the bone from any side that will enable you and according to the shape of the injury and whatever does not harm the patient. If during the uncovering of the bone, bleeding or hot pus occurs, counteract it as necessary.
The place should be filled with crushed myrobalan [a type of mangosteen] mixed in wine, oil, and lard, and the wound massaged until the worm settles and the discharge is secure. Then, the bone will be reinforced and extracted, and this procedure can be performed on either one of two aspects of the work.
One aspect is to cut the bone with a fine, tight sawblade. The appearance of this [cut] is as follows:.
Then another piece is used after this cut, slightly extended from it. The appearance of this [extension] is as follows:.
Then another piece is also used, extended from the second one as well. It is necessary that you have a variety of pieces with some being slightly longer than others and some shorter, and they should all be on the edge of sharpness. They should be made of good quality Indian steel or iron.
The lever is used to strike the bone in order not to injure the skull, for if the bone is hard and solid it should be drilled before using the pieces with the smooth chisels, which are called non-rough chisels.
This is because it does not exceed the depth of the skull bone beyond that point, for the chisel has a sharp tip similar to the bevel or small circle which prevents it from gouging and over-penetrating the bone.
It is necessary for you to choose many of these clamps numerous, each one suitable for the size of that bone until it brings for every joint a clamp of its side length and shortening according to the size of that joint, and this is a picture of three types. The three types are large clamps, medium clamps, and small clamps.
The method of clamping the broken bone is to place the clamp on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been cut through, then move the clamp to another location and make a distance between each clamp equal to the thickness of the rope or approximately.
Then, cut between the two clamps and do so until you have joined the bone either with your hand or with another tool from some of the instruments that you have prepared for this purpose.
For example, like the pliers and delicate forceps, it is necessary to avoid any danger of the clamp or cutter touching the marrow, so if the bone is covered with a layer of marrow and it adheres to it and you remove it, it is necessary to clean it.
"Smooth out the ulcer that remains in the bone with another tool resembling it, except that it should be sharper and softer than the others. If there remains something of small bones or shards, take them away with whatever tools you have.
"Then treat the wound with the scalpel and forceps as previously mentioned, and regarding the other aspect of the procedure, it is easy to extract a foreign body by means remote from danger, as Galen praised and highly commended this method. "First, you should start by excavating the bone fragment from the site of the fracture with the strongest and sharpest tool until you expose that piece of bone, then you should look beneath it for this broken fragment whose image is as follows:
"The broken fragment will be soft and not cut anything, while the sharp edge of it is on its movable sides in length as you can see. The soft fragment serves as a guide for the chisel, and the sharp edge of the broken piece in the bone should be struck from one side.
"With a small hammer, you should cut all the bone until it breaks with safety, as the fracture will not be dangerous. Even if the person performing the operation is inexperienced or clumsy.
If there remains anything that adheres to the bone in some positions of the bone, then shatter it with the pointed part of the instrument and remove it along with it. It will be removed without harm or fear.
If the bone is broken and does not reach the adhesion, and there remains a part of the bone with roughness and gristle on its surface, then it is necessary to excise that roughness and grind those gristles flat. You may take different measures from it for each case according to what guides you in the work and cure it accordingly.
The broken bone and its shape, it is necessary to first straighten the splinters then use something coarser afterwards, and do not stop until you have made it suitable for further use by smoothing and sharpening all of it.
As for the small, hairy fractures and fine breaks, it is necessary to treat each one according to what leads to its healing, which is not hidden from one who has knowledge in this craft. The lowest level of care and stopping at what has been written and clearly explained regarding large fractures.
If the wound remains open during bone setting, it is necessary to take a probe of suitable size and insert it into the marrow and flesh and place it on the wound site, then take another probe, either round or triangular. And insert it into a liquid mixture of marrow, fat and blood, place it on the first probe, then use a broad bandage that does not tighten except to hold the wound closed.
Leave it with this treatment for a few days until the hot inflammation subsides, then dissolve it and use medicine that contains ingredients that solidify such as root of sassafras, cinnamon powder, ginger powder, cardamom and similar substances, making a poultice from these medicines.
Keep the wound as clean as possible during treatment, for this reason use medicine that whitens and does not blacken. Make an effort during your treatment of the wound to ensure it remains clean, without grease, pus or accumulation of maggots.
Because maggots, if they gather on the skull wound, will rot and weaken it greatly, and this can lead to a very serious complication when the bone is exposed during surgery, especially if proper treatment is neglected.
Swelling on the surface of observation, if it shows symptoms as we have mentioned, then know that there is no remedy for it; however, if swelling only occurred due to a medicine placed upon it and the strength of that medicine was such that it could cause this swelling, then this swelling can be removed by weakening or completely removing the medication.
It is necessary to take three parts from honey and three parts of beeswax, grind them well and melt them together. Then apply this mixture to the plaster and treat it with the appropriate treatment until it heals.
Third chapter.
Treating a broken nose.
Know that the nose does not break except by a complete crack of its upper part or one of its parts because the part below it is cartilage and does not break; instead, it bends, twists, and swells.
If one of the cracks is broken, it is necessary to insert small fingers into the nose and reset the break from inside with your little finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape; this should be done carefully so that you do not cause any additional pain or damage to the patient.
If the break is in the upper part of the nose and has not reached the tip, it should be sutured with a thin wire-like material. If the break is on both sides, do as mentioned above, and apply pressure daily on the first day of the break.
If a fever is present on the seventh or tenth day, then enter through the nose a probe made of cedar wood if the break is in one part, or two probes if the break is in both parts.
Make the thread rough in size sufficient to fill the nose cavity, and some of the early physicians have said that one should smear the thread with oil each day; however, I do not see that as correct, rather it is preferable to smear the thread with white egg yolk mixed with wheat flour.
Leave the thread until the bone heals and the cartilage hardens; then insert into the nose tubes made from the yew tree after they have been treated with a soft, light substance to hold them in place for breaking the nose. This will make the splint stronger and prevent the fracture from healing improperly.
This is not necessary if you decide to make the thread or sutures; simply expose the nose and use a hot poultice or bandage soaked in a concoction made of camphor, cotton, wrapped in linen and/or something similar used by pharmacists.
If a boil does not burst, it should be lanced from outside with precise cautery of salt and lime, which has been well ground with egg white. Then place a poultice made of soft flour over it and do not bind the nostrils with anything, for if the bones of the nose are broken, they will break in small pieces.
If it opens up, it should be probed and drained with an appropriate tool then the wound should be stitched and treated with a remedy that agrees with it. If there is an injury inside the nose, it should be treated with a lancet and copper tubes should be used. Until it breaks open.
The fourth section.
If the lower jaw is fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured but not accompanied by injury in the face, if it is fractured from the outside and does not extend into the interior, then its recognition is easy.
If the fracture is in the right side, a splint made from the left hand should be inserted into the mouth of the patient and likewise if the fracture is in the left side, a splint made from the right hand should be inserted and lift the fractured piece from inside to outside.
Apply the other instrument from outside the bone to control it, if it's a broken jaw, it should be set with two fingers in alignment. If it has been fractured in the teeth, it will be displaced.
Use an instrument such as gold wire, silver or brass to tie it, then place the splint made of quarry stone on the broken bone, and place a large, firm plaster or a piece of thick leather equal in length to the bone. Then tie it from above as you see fit to secure it, keeping it in alignment so that it does not dislocate. The patient should rest and remain immobile, and feed him only soft, bland food. If you suspect a change in its shape in any direction, make sure to check it the next day.
Then tie it from above as you see fit to secure it, keeping it in alignment so that it does not dislocate. The patient should rest and remain immobile, and feed him only soft, bland food. If you suspect a change in its shape in any direction, make sure to check it the next day. Treat the fractured area with lime plaster mixed with egg white or fine flour after removing the splint, then place a soft padding on top of it. If the padding remains stuck to it and the bone does not change, leave it be.
Do not open it (the wound) until he breathes deeply and the fracture widens considerably, for this fracture often widens within three weeks. If there is a hot abscess appearing during that period, apply what was previously mentioned to treat it repeatedly until the abscess disappears.
If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and it appears that the bone has been displaced with shards or splinters, be gentle in removing these shards using an instrument of your choice to extract them. If there is a narrowing in the wound, widen it gently with a probe.
Then, if you have removed the shards and there remains nothing more from them, apply a compress on the wound if it is wide enough, otherwise place one of the dressings that suit the case. Warm the wound until it breathes.
Fifth Section.
In case of fracture, apply traction.
A fracture usually occurs at the end of a long bone, and it can break in one of three directions: either it breaks and splinters, or it happens without any splintering, which is easier to apply traction to.
Or if the fracture occurs with splinters, it is more difficult to apply traction, and if the fracture occurs without a wound, one must gather assistants to hold the bone segment being pulled on tightly while the other pulls in the opposite direction.
Then, set the fracture right with your fingers until its shape is as desired and there is no protrusion or sinking, if it requires a longer time, it is necessary to place under the broken bone a ball of linen or cotton.
Adjust the bone as necessary and pull the traction, raise the tissue and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set in its desired form. If you are unable to draw the end of the tissue out because it has gone too deep, it is necessary to extract the broken bone from one side.
Place a splint made of moderate size under the fracture and make the caretaker pull it down until the protruding bone rises to its correct position above. Then, adjust and set the fracture with your fingers.
If you suspect that a piece of the tissue has been fractured and is moving, it is necessary to press on it and extract the broken piece along with it. If the broken piece is embedded in the bone, it must be divided into pieces for extraction. After the traction device is placed under the bone, the instrument for holding the probe should be made of wood or metal and its shape is as follows:.
The cup resembles [it], but it has no excavation. Its width is according to the size of the bone required and its length according to what you can manage, and it should have two sides like the wider one you see or the narrower one.
If the incision that you made for the removal of bone splinters is wide and the pain is severe, gather the wound with suturing, and if the incision is easy or you are afraid of the severe pain, anesthetize the wound with the incision and as much as the incision allows.
If there is severe pain, anesthetize the incision with oil, honey or alcohol and carry it, and if the bone is not injured or not fractured, hold on to the adhesive taken from charcoal powder with white egg. Place the lint on it, then place the ball under its bandage if necessary, then take a long stick that is narrow or about that and hold two ligatures and the adhesive on the wound, then take a sharp knife. Its width should be three fingers and in length likewise, then arrange it in the incision, then arrange that incision with the knife in the position of the fracture, then tighten the adhesive on the fracture as it rotates. The fracture should be set on the neck and beneath the articular surface of both the healthy and the diseased bone. It should be manipulated in all directions, and you should see if the pressure stabilizes the fracture firmly; this is something that should not escape your notice.
The ligature must not be removed from the fractured bone. It is recommended that the ligature be examined every day, and each time it is found that the ligature has slipped, adjust it accordingly and tighten the ligature again. Then let the patient sleep on his back with a small pillow under his neck at night.
The bone should be raised with it to elevate the fracture along with the upward movement of the limb, or the arm should be tied to the neck, and the ligature should not be loosened unless there is an accidental or traumatic event occurring within 14 days.
Then change the dressing if you notice any signs for that purpose. Apply pressure and leave it until the fracture becomes stable, strengthening more within 42 days. It may be so in some people in a shorter time period.
Sixth Chapter.
Sixth Chapter: Fracture of the Collarbone. If the collarbone cracks at its broadest part, it does not fracture completely but rather breaks some of its letters. But if it ever cracks at a point or cracks in the middle, this is known by touch. Its form depends on what kind of crack it has.
Adjust it and put it back to its natural shape from every direction you can, then place on the site a mixture of potsherd with egg white and soft glue. Then place over it a flat sheet of bone.
Scrape the collarbone gently to its full length or slightly more than it, if there is a hollow beneath the plate in one of the collarbone sites, fill that hollow with soft glue until the plate lies flat, then fasten from above with a long pin.
Tighten and fasten the plate firmly so that it does not come off its place, and check the screws every day. Whenever a screw comes loose, tighten it again and adjust the plate if it comes off from its place, but make sure the injury is on the correct side of the collarbone, as the collarbone heals in 20 days.
If [it is] a day or twenty-two days, and when this number has passed, then loosen the bandages, and you are safe; for it is of the bones which there is no fear of breaking nor splintering. If any piece of bone protrudes beneath the skin, break it and remove it. Make what you have described in the treatment of broken bone for relieving a hot worm if something like that occurs.
Section Seven.
On the Treatment of Broken Neck.
The neck may break in the middle slightly, but it is less likely to do so and its sides are more prone to breaking and dislocating. Among its symptoms when it breaks in the middle are that the head bends downwards, exposing it to pain, difficulty in breathing, and suffocation.
If it bleeds and the fracture is visible in the bone, bind it with a bandage that presses against the fractured area and covers it entirely, then gradually apply pressure from both sides while adjusting it as needed on all sides to straighten it.
Compress it until the bone's shape returns to its desired form, then place a plaster or similar material on top of it, securely covering it with bandages after breaking it in a crack. Then, you should be gentle when tying [it] to the broken bone so it does not slip, and pass the suture in a circular motion toward the chest several times and tighten it firmly. Then, check the suture at every moment, and whenever it becomes loose, tighten it again.
If it should be necessary to treat a wound, ulcer or abscess, then treat it and loosen the bandage, cure what is exposed of that by the treatment method appropriate for it, then return the bandage if you see fit. Turn it over and press firmly until it comes out.
The eighth section.
In the treatment of fractures, know that fractures occur in places that are close to the chest and along its sides because they are weak points. The swelling [due to the fracture] is evident to touch during examination by fingers.
Press it back into place with fingers on the most suitable side until its shape is as desired, then bind and compress the broken bone tightly if necessary. If a fracture is near internal organs, it may lead to serious swelling or pain.
We make an incision similar to the one that exposes a person for amputation, so that the bone will break the covering and also expose it to pain, difficulty in breathing, excessive bleeding, and this makes the treatment difficult; and the beginning of it is often full of complications.
Some of them say it is necessary to make the diet of the patient produce flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen swells and expands and fracture is forced outwards; but we dislike this because it may lead to the occurrence of inflammation if no inflammation occurs; if inflammation has occurred, it increases and strengthens it.
Some of them say a plug should be placed at the site, then it should be pressed with strength, which is similar to measuring except that it fears that the plug will attract pus to the site in case of weakness; some of them say it is necessary for the site to be covered with a cloth soaked in hot oil.
The wound will heal between the incisions until it is filled, and if the ligature is loosened on a rotating basis, then the patient should be treated with food and medicine for wounds; for the patient's condition is severe and cannot endure it. The bone is sensitive to the touch, it becomes painful and we fear a fracture, it is necessary that we make an incision at the location and expose the broken part, then we should put the tool beneath it which preserves the tip and describe it, and cut the bone along with it and extract it.
We collect the wounded eyes if it is large by sewing, and treat it with cautery until it bleeds, for if it opens during this process and a hot wound occurs, then we should apply mustard on the spot and treat the inflammation from within as well.
It is taken on the side that avoids sleep until it heals.
The ninth chapter.
Cauterizing of the forehead and neck.
If the bones of the neck are fractured or have a slight exposure, and also if there is a risk of infection, and the same applies to the skull fractures, if it is exposed to someone and you want to know whether it heals or not. Look, if you see that his hands have become cold and pale, and they are swollen and cannot be moved or stretched or squeezed, and if you try to squeeze or pierce them with a needle, but he does not feel it and finds no pain in them, then know that it is mostly not healing, and it will perish.
If it moves them both and he feels bone scraping and grinding, know that the fracture of the bone has settled and that the patient is ready for treatment. However, if you find a crepitus in the back, similar to this, and want to learn whether it also recovers or not, it does recover as well.
Look at his legs, if you see that they are fractured and the same thing happened in the hands, then when he lies on his back, gas and pus come out without intention, and when he presses on his abdomen, urine comes out without intention. If he presses on his back and desires to urinate but cannot, know that he is dying, so do not treat him. For if nothing of this kind has happened to him, the matter is better. The treatment for what happened is to relieve pain by cooling the hot wound.
Place warm oil of almond or with white lard on the inflamed bladder and let it stay for three times during the day until the hot pain subsides. Then, put one of the binding bandages made of clean cloths on the spot and tighten it with rope, order him to rest and decide.
A man shall not sleep except on the side where he finds no pain until it relieves, for if something has occurred in a bone during anger, or if something has been relieved from it, it is necessary to incise the skin over it and remove that bone. Then gather the wounded eyes if they are large with sewing, then treat it with warm pigeon droppings until it relieves. If the last bone of the big toe is broken and it's the heel bone, it is necessary to apply pressure from the left hand in the hollow part.
Straighten the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible, and then apply a splint and bandage if necessary, then set it.
If you feel a fracture in it, incise and remove it, and treat the wound with the appropriate treatment until it relieves.
The Tenth Chapter.
On the Treatment of a Broken Nail.
When nails are broken, it is only a break if it splits along the sides and cracks in length, bends towards inside and exposes the place and pain occurs at the site, and the finger swells and turns black from that side.
Thou must roll thy hand upon it until thou reach the break, and when its shape is known to thee; if the break be at the sides only, then set that break in order according to what appears suitable for mending it to resemble its natural shape.
If the break be in length or if it has been displaced within, place a splint on its belly until it becomes stable for thee to set that break. Once set, apply bandages to it, then place a splint made of wood or leather and tie it strongly.
Fear not for the break to move nor for the splint to slip, and mend the fracture from the splinters that fill it until the tie takes its proper shape. Order the patient to lie on his back or on the correct side, for he will feel hot and painful if exposed.
Loosen the bandages and set the fracture until the hot pain subsides, then place on it what soothes it according to what is available, then return to setting and tying as required. If there are splinters in the bone or a crack from its sides, do not remove them.
Do not touch but set it from outside as we have said and leave the tie until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
In Surgery: Fracture of the Bone.
The bone is from the shoulder joint to the end of the limb; if it is fractured, you should set it on two sides; one side shall hold a straight rod with a medium thickness in this manner:.
And tie rods on either side, then from a high place he sits and the fracture patient leans over the rod; then he puts his broken arm on the rod so that its forearm becomes stuck in the middle of the rod's curve, then something heavy is placed above it.
Or the servant lowers [the patient] and the doctor adjusts the fracture with his hands until the fracture aligns as intended, and the other side is for the fracture patient to lean on his elbow and tie his hand from his neck with a rope.
Then order the servants to press gently on either side of the fracture, one from above and the other from below; each should pull towards his side, and if you wish it to be more secure, tighten a rope under the fracture and place one above it, and let each servant pull towards their respective sides.
If the fracture is near the elbow, it is necessary that the center of the rope be under the forearm and the other end under the fracture in the direction of the joint; similarly, if the fracture is near the joint, it should be on that place and on the joint itself.
Then, the fracture shall be set with a gentle pressure until it is level as required and allowed to heal naturally. If it does not develop a hot pus, leave it as it is. But if it develops a hot pus, wait for the seventh day, then place a soft cloth soaked in honey and oil of wormwood on it.
Then, if the pus disappears, set the fracture. The dressing should be removed from the fracture, then a piece of fresh plaster should be placed on it. Gather the limb to the body and place the hand open on the plaster.
Wrap the fracture and the cast on the limb, so that the limb stands in the position of the bones. If it does not prevent you from doing this and if it does not change anything in the broken bone, use plaster. If you fear that something might change in it, use splints.
Put splints on the fracture, which should be straight and stronger than other splints, and make a space between each splint so that there is an interval of about three fingers' width for each side of the splint.
Then press firmly on the fracture as described in the first part of this chapter.
And it should be firm pressure at the site of the break.
And after the fracture, if you see the position of the bones and the pressure as we have described earlier when you press the limb from your hour, do that.
If you fear the hot inflammation, leave the pressure and bones till the seventh day as we have mentioned earlier. Then examine the bandages every three days so that no pain or wind or food reaches the limb due to the continued pressure. This will heal everything, as we have described.
If you are confident that nothing will happen in this case, do not loosen the bandages except after many days. The swelling should be on top of the affected area and the hand should be placed on its side under the limb, covered with a cushion filled with evenly distributed cotton.
Examine at every opportunity, day or night, so that the shape of the broken limb does not change or the bandages weaken. This will heal everything with your effort, and make the food for the affected area gentle at first until the bones have healed.
It is necessary that food softens, for usually the intestines and veins harden in forty days, then it is necessary that it dissolves and the hot bath is used and it is treated with appropriate poultices, if the break is severe.
Do not dissolve bandages from it for more than fifty days or two months.
Chapter thirteen.
In the book on broken bone.
The bone is composed of two bones and it is called the ulna, one of them is smaller and lies above the elbow, and the other is larger and is below the smaller one; rarely does the larger bone break on its own or the smaller one breaks on its own, and rarely do they both break together.
When the smaller upper bone breaks, its healing is easy and it heals faster; when the lower bone breaks, its break is difficult and healing is slower, and if both bones break, then the bone which caused the smaller upper bone to break is more likely to be the one that broke.
It is necessary for the physician when treating a broken bone that he should make it easier to move, until it is set; if the larger bone is the one that broke, then it is necessary that he makes it stronger; and if both bones are broken, then it is necessary that he makes it much stronger.
The hand shape should be placed under the patient and stretched out straight on a board. The hand should be bound above all the fingers, with the little finger being lower than the others and the thumb standing erect on itself.
The board should be raised to a level such that the patient does not suffer difficulty.
Then the attendant holding the limb shall pull it from below either with his hand or with a rope, and the other assistant shall pull from above in the same manner. Then the physician should adjust the bone until it is aligned properly. If there is a fracture of the bone, grating sounds will be heard.
Align each fragment in its place with effort, for if a free-floating fragment appears and it pierces the skin without causing much pain, break it in the manner described earlier, for if the fracture is accompanied by injury, you will have failed to set it correctly.
Take treatment for this from there, if the joint is swollen and hot at first, make an incision with a lancet made of boar's bristles or white camel hair, keep it moderate between piercing and scraping, press firmly until the pain subsides.
Extract the pus, place a clean dressing made of ashes from the mill mixed with egg white. Then pick up the forceps and make it strong and slightly inclined. Know that the number of forceps in the arm is usually four.
The fracture can be in one bone or in two bones together, then make your grip stronger on the location of the fracture and make it stronger and firmer, and whenever you increase the strength, move it slightly higher or lower, a little bit closer to what was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Make the probe soft and not too hard, and let the thread that holds it be moderate between being rough and smooth as we have described. Also check the limb and the ligament after some days.
If something happens that needs repair, such as a swelling in the limb, it is necessary to immobilize the limb with warm water until the swelling settles and then leave it free for the night until it relaxes, and then reapply the grip.
If the grip has relaxed and the bone has settled or something similar, repair it all with your effort, also look to see if food is prevented from reaching the limb due to the tightness of the grip, in that case, you should leave it for a short while and wait for food to reach it, then reapply the grip.
If the patient has not been affected by anything we have mentioned, it is not advisable to perform surgery except after twenty days or around that period, then tie the arm of the patient to his neck so that the elbow is level, and he should maintain effort from forced movements and make him sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm will heal in thirty days or two and a half months, or it may heal in eighty-two days, all according to the conditions of the patient and his strength.
The third chapter.
On the subject of breaking the hand and fingers.
The fracture of the hand and finger joints is more exposed to rupture than to breaking, but when does the hand break or is it ruined?
The patient should sit erect and in front of him a chair on a level surface.
Then, he should place his hand on the chair and the servant of bones will be summoned to arrange them, and the doctor will do so until they align properly. If there is no complication or hot swelling, then a bandage and splint should be applied. After that, a cushion from above should be placed according to the situation.
"If the break is below the wrist, make a ball-shaped suture from the thread and instruct the assistant to grasp it with the broken hand, then press firmly with the suture thread.
"To make a suture from tendon, smooth the skin over all fingers and press it with force as required, if the break is outside then make one suture above and another below in the hand so that the hand remains open.
"Then, the pressure is applied as the hand turns and the fingers are interlaced with a rope. If the break is visible between any of the fingers, if there is swelling then it should be treated appropriately, then press with the hand and if desired, make a small suture to hold the break.
"If the break is in all fingers such as the middle, thumb, index or little finger, it should be treated and then sutured to the correct finger or all of them are sutured together on a splint, this is best, or a small suture can be placed on it.
"As was said before, in case of swelling and abscess, apply what is needed during the time of pressure and after it has passed from the hot fever, take appropriate measures whenever such occurs.
Fourth Chapter Ten.
In Surgery: Fracture of the Bone.
The Bone of the Leg is frequently Fractured and it is easily felt as it deviates towards the front and back, and its fracture will be by tension above the crack and tension below the crack, and the fractured bone should be set in place.
Then each ligature should be pulled towards its end in proportion to this (procedure), if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But, if it is near the base of the limb, it is necessary to tighten the ligatures either with sinew or something similar.
At the base of the limb, the pulling should be towards above and the other ligature below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the joint, the ligatures should be near the joint and pulled downwards. Then the physician should align the bone with both hands until it assumes its natural shape.
The bone should be broken carefully, then it is necessary that the ligatures and compression are applied unless there is pain or swelling in the limb. If there is swelling, wait until the heat subsides before returning to treatment.
If the compression is tightened, it is necessary to loosen it on the fracture with a hot and wide tool twice or thrice, leaving some slack, then tie the thread so that the knot is at the end of the limb, and insert a long cord between the bone and the flesh near the joint from below, and make the ends of the cord on both sides.
Then, he should turn the leg and thigh well, more than usual examination, then make a probe at the place of break on the thigh and make it into a single probe, and put it in the bone of the leg, then fill the gap between the thigh and the leg with soft wax to equalize the tension.
Then, he should start with tightening the strengths from the center at the place of break, three or four twists, and every time he advances with a loop from the place of break, his tension should become less, softer, and looser.
Then, he should go to the ends of the string that you have inserted between the thigh and the leg, tie it with what is above, then pass by the end of the string towards below until it reaches the ankle, tighten both ends of the string along with the other probes from the other side.
In order for the loop not to fall off from its place, then leave the tension on it until it is no longer affecting the limb with eating or pain or breathing or similar things, for if something like this happens, rectify it and correct everything that happened due to it according to what we mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter in the bone, it must be removed if possible, and if not, break it and remove it, and treat the injury with similar methods until it heals, but this fracture of the thigh can be reinforced without adding the leg with probes.
As we have mentioned in the limb and the bone, except that its dislocation is not exposed to any cause for it to protrude, even if it has been dislocated; there is no doubt that the owner of it must hold it constantly.
Know that the fracture (of a bone) lasts about fifty days, or may increase slightly or decrease slightly, all of this is subject to differences in the composition and various conditions.
The fifth chapter.
On the fracture of a horse's pelvis.
A fracture in the horse's pelvis is somewhat exposed to fractures and it is often exposed to rupture greatly, so if it is exposed to a fracture, it will be either a crack or splitting in some of its parts and this occurs with injury or without injury.
Hold on to all of that by touch, and dislocate it so that what has been separated from its parts comes together with the fingers until they are united and bound together according to what is possible for their union and bonding and certainty, then support the bandage and place a sling around it if it is necessary.
The pressure from the fracture that is suitable for this (procedure) persists, then it accommodates all conditions we have described in other fractures such as inflammation and similar situations by facing each problem with what suits it to heal until it heals completely.
Sixteenth Chapter.
On Jaw Fracture.
On the Bone of the Jaw, there are two bones; one is thick and is called the bone of the jaw, and the other is thin and is called zanda. Both are subject to various types of fracture, except for that which affects the bone of the arm. Therefore, fracturing the jaw is similar to arm fracture in terms of treatment; if both bones are fractured, the jaw will be displaced in all directions. If only the thin bone is fractured, the jaw will be displaced towards the front, and if the thick bone is fractured alone, which can occur from below, it is obvious.
Use the splint, alignment, and binding of the jawbones accordingly; except that if the fracture of the jaw is a comminuted one with many fragments, it is advisable to make the splint smaller and thinner, and to exert your effort on the jaw.
In the jaw, there is an additional step beyond the arm; when you have aligned and completed all your work, take two cups of snakebite wine which are used in the treatment of wounds or made from date pits or similar materials.
Choose from it that which has a little toughness and is not brittle, and its length should be equal to the length of the thumb from the wrist to below. Then, break each one into two pieces on its length, and place one part on the thumb and the other part on the opposite side.
From the wrist to below the foot, then bind the splints in three places on both sides and in the middle. In this way, the thumb is prevented from bending inward, outward, or upward excessively. A measuring stick made of wood can be used for the length of the thumb.
Place it to keep it from movement, and it is best to do that when there is a specific injury. Then, examine the thumb every day with great care to prevent inflammation or infection or anything else. If something like this happens, apply what is necessary until it heals, and the thumb joint should be immobilized for about thirty days or close to that.
The seventh chapter.
On fractures of bones and fingers.
As for the elbow, it is not subject to the fracture of the biceps bone and as for the bones of the leg, they can be subjected to a fracture. The fingers also have less susceptibility to a fracture, but they are more prone to dislocation in most cases.
If the leg bone is exposed and you see some of the bones protruding against each other, place your foot on the ground at an angle like a donkey's and then you place your foot on what rises above those bones, press and straighten it.
Until it returns to its place, then take the bandages and splints from above and place them under the sole of the foot on a small flat surface with two concave sides, then press firmly on it with force after breaking it with the levers and whatever else is needed.
If it has been three or four days and the leg bone is set, release the bandages. You will find the bones are level as they were broken or displaced. The work is then done as you see. As for if some of the fingers are broken, force them straight according to what you have described in the art of finger manipulation.
Then make a splint for the broken fingers of the same length as the finger and slightly protruding from it, then place this board under the foot which you have described, and press it firmly with great force, for if a bone in the leg is broken in two or more places.
Apply a blunt probe of suitable size, placed in the incision, on every toe; let each head of the probe protrude externally from the foot so that it may serve as a handle for fine adjustment.
It is obligatory for you to follow all that we have mentioned regarding the fracture, including all its possible symptoms that we have described, as well as what is required for each symptom.
The 14th section.
In the fracture of the womb, the bone of the ear and the man's bone (penis).
If the womb of a woman is fractured, she should be placed in a sitting position and then gradually turned towards her back, and then hold her from behind. Then, wrap her with cotton until it fills her up and makes a ball inside her.
Then, shake the woman slightly and raise her bones a little at a time, for this cotton will come out until it reaches the opening of the womb like a ball and the fracture in the bone will heal. After that, place a flat piece of cloth on her stomach so that when she wants to urinate, you remove the cotton together with it until she urinates.
Then, return it to the way you inserted it originally, then go back to her original position. Do this for seven days or approximately so, for it will heal. If you want to take a bath, hold a narrow tube in her mouth and insert all of it into her womb.
Then blow into the cannula with force until the bladder inflates inside the abdomen; if it breaks, return it (to its original state), then suture it with linen and leave it for several days until it heals. As for when bone of the penis breaks in a man or woman, it is used to set it.
Set it as described in the bone of the phallus, and it is not hidden from you that the cure for these rare fractures, which are difficult to find and especially for those who have some knowledge of my book, lies in the fact that the fracture itself guides you in most cases.
On the path of cure in setting and suturing, if a man's bone breaks, take a splint made of ox-hide, enter it into him, then place it on him. Leave it for three days or about that until it heals.
The ninth chapter.
In setting bone fractures with injury.
It is necessary for the one who presents with a fracture accompanied by injury, and especially if the bone is large such as the phalanx or ribs or similar, to make every effort to separate it from its time when you can meet the conditions of separation as we have mentioned.
If the wound bleeds, it is necessary to apply a powdered cautery to it. If there's no assistant, do it yourself immediately.
If a hot inflammation does not occur, do nothing. But if a hot inflammation occurs, leave the cauterization for nine days until the hot inflammation subsides and do not approach it on the third and fourth day as it may show adverse effects.
If the fractured bone protrudes through the skin, it is necessary to reduce and set it with your hands along with a gentle pull. But if reduction and setting with your hands does not work, reduce and set it with this instrument, which is an instrument made of iron about seven or eight fingers in length. Expose it to the wound.
The physician should take from it (the fracture) three or four pieces, depending on what treatment is required for each type of fracture, and he should roll them up so that they are contained in a narrow space, with a little glue to prevent it from breaking when squeezed during the operation.
The edges of the instrument should be sharp with a concave shape on one side and convex on top, and its bottom half should be smooth and well-tempered, as shown below:.
The Yunanian peri (small knife) is named thus because it aims for a small incision, making its tip sharp and directing it towards the adjacent bone, then pushing with it until the bone returns and levels with some of the surrounding areas; thus, the fractured edges are aligned one with another.
If the fractured edge is sharp and the instrument does not grasp it properly, it is necessary to cut that bone until the instrument can take hold of it. If it cannot return the bone as described by our method, then cut it with whatever cutters we have mentioned.
If you can't use one of the saws, then cut it as you are able to. After that, remove any roughness or shards remaining in the bone. If the bone returns and there is a hole left behind after its return and the pain is severe and distressing, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, you will be of great benefit to the patient. If you have exerted your strength on the bone, then immerse a splinter in a dark, specific liquor – if you are in summer – and do not put cotton or anything with oil on the wound.
Do not let anything putrefy or decay in it, then use the forceps when you are released from the bone's grip and leave the wound open so that it may be cauterized with a probe in its channels as much as necessary for the wound.
Be careful not to let the wound break too much for this often causes problems in their sickness, either death or gangrene or ulcers. Let your cauterization be soft and gentle, opposing that of other fractures.
If the wound is small or large and you fear some minor side effects that we have described, and if it becomes inflamed in the place, do not apply forceps and do not make channels for lead to be placed into their location and cauterize it.
If after a day or two, you notice that the wound begins to grow pus, then remove the probe which was placed in it with liquid and use the lancets and leeches as we usually cauterize wounds like the four-leech and similar ones, and it is advisable for you to loosen the bandages.
Examine the wound every day at both dusk and dawn until it closes, and it is advisable to place the limb in a position that makes it easy for pus to drain from it. If the wound persists for many days without healing or the pus does not drain from it, know that there are small shards of bone.
It is necessary to probe the wound with a probe; if it contains any foreign bodies, remove them and extract them. If part of it is not free, and it causes swelling or pain, cut it in pieces and remove it entirely. You can do this from all sides.
If the wound is exposed to dirt, ulcers or any other form of corruption and necrosis, it is necessary to treat each aspect of it with the appropriate remedy as described in their respective chapters.
It is important to remain with the patient and prepare mentally if a large bone is broken, such as the femur or humerus, which is one of the larger bones. Do not attempt to draw it out or extract it. Many times, death is averted by leaving it [the bone] alone; however, it may not heal for twenty or thirty days.
Treat the wound if you find a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it alone.
Chapter Ten.
Treatment of the swelling that occurs due to some fractures.
This swelling often occurs due to the inflammation caused by fractures, and it is rarely far from the joints; it causes the shape of the limb to deform and prevents the natural function of the limb.
If the tumor is soft, use medicines that coagulate such as scab, lime, lime-juice, antimony and similar things; take some of them or all of them, knead with a liquid that coagulates like vinegar, white of egg or oil.
Apply them on the tumor in a poultice and press it strongly upon it, leave the pressure for many days until it dissolves; then let it go and repeat the process until the tumor disappears, if God wills, or press a firm piece of lead on it.
The lead has a special property that dissolves everything in the body; if the tumor is hardened and becomes difficult to remove, break it from above and cut off the surrounding flesh or cauterize it with a cautery until it dissolves and heals the wound until it closes up.
Chapter Twenty and Ten.
In the treatment of fractures, if the bone breaks and remains in its original shape.
If a bone fracture occurs and the limb remains weak after that, it is because of several reasons. One of them might be due to excessive tying of ligatures on something other than what is appropriate, or it might be due to overtightening the ligatures until food cannot reach the organ, or it might be due to excessive and disorderly tugging, or it might be due to movements at an inappropriate time, or it might be due to a lack of blood in the body of the patient and weakness.
The treatment for this is feeding the patient and stimulating his body to increase blood in it, followed by the use of leeches and insertion of cupping glasses on him, along with moxibustion and similar methods, then placing a poultice on the organ to attract food to it or to relieve the tugging with warm water. until food flows through it and returns to its natural form.
The second chapter, the 100th.
In the treatment of broken bones that have been fractured and immobilized improperly.
When an organ has been fractured or the bone is broken, or when it has swollen and become deformed as a result of that, its image should be taken. Except if the organ is not prevented from performing its natural function, it is not permissible for someone to claim that they can break the organ when it comes from the head; many ignorant physicians and compulsive people do this in our country.
This operation is very dangerous and can lead to a severe wound, but if the incision and suturing are made in a straight line, it should be washed with boiling water containing healing herbs such as comfrey leaves, onion roots, garlic, and similar things.
To treat a fracture, use the hard, precise splints made from boxwood or sycamore, or take pieces of comfrey root, mix with chicken fat and geranium oil and apply it, or use willow bark and pound it with soapstone and sand, or use similar medicines that are called remedies for pain.
To relieve pain caused by swelling, use a smooth, thin needle that is always kept in the hand and move the limb to all sides at all times. If the swelling has worsened and become hardened and requires treatment with iron.
It is necessary to cut the swelling and disconnect the bone, and remove any excess tissue or bone with neat cuts, then stitch the wound using strong sutures until it heals.
The third and forty-first chapter.
In the jaw, it is the dislocation of a joint from its place which causes immobility and changes the shape of the bone, leading to injuries or severe pain. If someone has a jaw problem, he should promptly move from his place towards the cure.
The toothache should not be delayed as it makes the healing of the jaw more difficult, so he should not move nor eat during the time of the toothache because it often leads to swelling and harmful injuries.
But if that occurs, he should promptly go towards removing the cause, then wait until the pain subsides a little, and then soak the bone with hot water and oil, and move it gently while treating each bone as its treatment is mentioned in its place.
The jaws have also been arranged according to what is in front of the body from top to bottom.
Fourth and Tenth Sections.
Treatment of the Lower Jaw Fracture.
A fracture of the jaw occurs only in the lower jaw, and extracting both the upper and lower teeth is on one side, either by their loosening from their places which would be easy to remove with a little force, or by a complete extraction until it can be removed. To the throat, until it reaches the base of the skull, so that it may soothe the pain of the patient and he cannot grasp it, nor can it be compressed; it vibrates against his tongue with speech. If it slips out easily, then it usually returns to its state more easily.
If it completely comes out, then promptly return it and do not delay it; the servant should hold the head of the patient and the doctor should enter his hand into the mouth from the inside of the cheek, if the cheek is on one side.
Or, he may enter both hands if the cheek is on both sides, and all his fingers from outside to smooth it and tell the patient to swallow the instrument and move it to every direction; the doctor smoothes the cheek and pushes the cheek until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult to return and if both cheeks are present, use a substance with hot water and oil until it becomes easier to return them, as we said; when they return and settle in place, apply the benefits of cupping with a cup made from leather and a pumice stone that has been prepared.
Then bind it with a ligature of strong cord, and let its head rest on its back and neck, so that it does not move to the right or left, nor require any sustenance, but make its food soft and liquid.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is set, let it eat what it wants, but do not use it [the bound jaw] for speech or handling food during eating and drinking, until the jaw sets and swells up.
If the jaws are unable to close when they have been set, and if this condition persists for a long time without improvement, it often results in abscesses and chronic pain. Moreover, the patient's stomach may burst or the wound may break open intermittently. If you see this, then know that it is a failure.
And often the patient dies within ten days of this treatment.
The fifth and fortieth section.
On the treatment of fractured jaws and the dislocation of the mandible.
If the fracture is internal and has not penetrated the chest, it will not dislocate to the outside. This can be confirmed by palpation, and the bone should be immobilized by the patient lying on their back and extending their arms.
Then press the site with your finger, pressing firmly, for it will recede. Then place the lancet and the scalpel upon it and cut it, and as for its side which faces the navel and is connected to it, it should not be cut except in the crotch; if it is cut anywhere else, it must be sutured as we have described previously, and it should be made ready for you.
Then place the lancet and the scalpel upon it and press firmly until it retracts, then command the patient to inhale deeply and hold his breath until he retches, with this treatment the side of the navel will recede if it remains in its place.
Chapter 6 and 10.
Treatment of protrusion and hernia of the navel.
Know that the navel protrudes in three directions: one is that it protrudes towards the loin below, the second is that it protrudes towards the chest and possibly protrudes above the navel, and this occurs in the inguinal region.
And it does not protrude towards the back near the armpit or towards the front near the abdomen, and most often it protrudes and comes out below towards the inguinal region, especially in those with less subcutaneous tissue as it comes out quickly and returns quickly.
Those with many fleshy growths, it means that it (the growth) comes out in the yawning and enters in the yawning, and perhaps presents a blow or fall may cause the limb to twitch and the pain to be intense; he thinks that it has been broken. It is necessary to verify that until you are certain of its truth.
When it (the growth) is below, near the jaw, if you press between the affected and healthy limb, you will find a visible difference between them; you will find a pit in the affected limb, and when touched, the tip of the limb feels like an egg.
The patient cannot raise his hand to his ear nor move it with all movements, and similarly if the limb is broken near the shoulder or above, you will find this obvious when touched, it is not hidden.
This fracture can be easily reduced if it is straight or if the patient is young, and reduce it by having an assistant raise his hand above, then you place your hands under his elbow and lift the fractured limb forcefully to its position; the assistant raises his hand and pulls it upward.
Then, he should introduce it downwards, for it will return quickly; if it does not return as we have mentioned and the swelling has been present for many days, it is necessary to seek a reason in hot water and use purgatives such as casting-sugar, aloes, and myrrh, which are boiled in hot water and used.
The cause should be drawn onto the surface and placed under a soft leather ball, which is neither too hard nor too soft; then, the physician should make an incision in the ball and hold it with his hand while he guides it downwards.
The ball should be pushed with the leg, for it will return to its place; if you wish to bring it out from this side, prepare a longer stick and stop it at the flank; then, insert the stick under the leather covering of the cause and lift the leather above so that the cause is suspended in the air. The last servant should draw the cause downwards into his belly; if it is light, it is necessary to attach something else to weigh it down because the swelling may return in its time, and it may also turn on another side.
Place a long wooden peg in the ground, its shape should be similar to the haw's beak, neither heavy nor delicate. Then place it under the ass of the patient after placing a blunt awl on the head of the peg and the ass, and stand it up to the length of the peg.
Then move your hand to the other side and push the body from the opposite direction with force, for the separation will return quickly to its place. If it is difficult to bring it back, use this treatment which is to take a stick of such length as two forearms. Present it with a length of four fingers and thickness of two fingers, having a straight tip to facilitate its insertion into the anus on this shape:.
Then tie a blunt awl to the straight tip, so as not to harm the peg, then press it below the anus and move both hands and the forearms downwards on the stick and bind the stick to the limb and assist in pulling it up.
Place the forearm on a straight surface. Relax and move the hand downwards, leaving the rest of the body hanging from the opposite side. The separation will enter through its opening. If it enters at any angle, place a ball made of yarn under the anus to balance its size.
Then, the patient is made to bear a ball of burnt clay mixed with soap and egg white on all parts, as it is rotated from above. Then, the ball is firmly pressed under the nail from below and moved along the ligature from above and it is attached to his hand at the neck.
He should be made to leave his hand still for seven days, and it is best that his diet be reduced until the limb recovers more quickly. Then, after seven or five days, he should begin moving it. If it holds and does not swell, then it has been cured.
If the wound frequently exudes due to moisture or another cause, then it is necessary to use three sulphides in each of the following steps for the preparation of the kiyya (a type of dressing), as this method should be followed and the ligature should be released after seven days, but if the wound does not heal.
If the dressing and pressure have been applied several times, but it does not heal, falls out and becomes swollen, and cannot be raised above, then know that the bone at the end of the finger has either broken or extended or become swollen. Know this when the ligature will never heal in its place.
If a fracture occurs in the mandible resembling the chest and shoulder, extending to the back, it should be treated by traction with the hands until it returns to its place. All pressure and treatment should be applied until it heals. If it appears deformed after healing within the bone and impaired in movement.
The hammam should not be applied repeatedly until that deformity is corrected and it returns to its original state.
Chapter Seven and Forty.
Treatment of fractured mandible.
A fractured mandible heals slowly and also returns slowly, it extends in all directions and it is not hidden from you since it occurs under the sight and touch in any shape or form of a crack.
If the fractured mandible heals incorrectly, it will be apparent to you by the swelling of the fracture and the inability for it to move or for you to touch it without pain. It is important that you act quickly and reposition the mandible before it becomes exposed to cold or heat.
If it is exposed to cold or heat, repositioning it will be difficult and in most cases it may not heal well, especially if the mandible is behind. In such a case, all types of fractures are painful and death often accompanies them.
If it is something that can return, the attendant's hand should be forced back with both his hands and his arm extended. The physician should press from above and below until the fracture returns to its place.
If it is a dislocated jaw, it can be reduced by applying pressure with the hand until it reaches the concave part of the jawbone which it impinges upon. If the reduction does not occur, apply strong traction on both arms of the attendant.
The attendant must also be held so that he does not slip during the traction, then the arm is moved in all directions after pressing on his hand with a rolled cloth or wide thread. If the physician touches the fracture with his hand, it should be smeared with oil to facilitate the reduction of the fracture easily.
The fracture should be reduced forcefully until it returns, and after its return, a cast made of plaster with the setting of white lime should be applied tightly and left for several days. The arm should be tied from the neck of the attendant and left to rest.
Then, let it heal if the incision remains in its place. If you find that the suture has not become inflamed, undo and replace the sutures as needed, leaving him for some days until it becomes inflamed, then heal it. If something similar happens after the removal of the suture and it is healed again.
If it is difficult in movement, do not use the stretching in the bath or light massage and plucking until it softens, or put oil on the incision then suture it and leave for a day and night, then remove it and enter him into the bath. If swelling occurs, stretch the incision with a moderate tourniquet.
Then make oil applications on him three or four times with bathing until it softens. If you wish, apply warm goat fat mixed with oil and press it several times, for it will soften and return to its original state.
The eighth and tenth section.
On the treatment of a dislocation.
A dislocation of the hand often occurs and returns spontaneously, but it is necessary to hasten its reduction within the hour in which it occurred before setting or exposing it to heat.
Place the probe of the scapula on a flat surface and let the servant hold it. The physician shall place his hand on the division (between two bones) and push it until it returns, unless it is necessary to ensure that the fracture has gone deep into the wrist of the hand.
Place the probe of the scapula on a flat surface and let the servant hold it. The physician shall place his hand palm-down on the same division, for if it returns then the fracture is at the surface of the hand. If not, he should push gently to reduce the dislocation.
Leave it for a while and it will not return, except that the fracture remains in its place and does no harm to the probe, unless the hand has become stiff and cannot be grasped.
If it is certain that the nerve has been cut or severed, then there is no solution except to put pressure on the area (with a bandage), for perhaps it may help, but perhaps not, so if the probe returns, hold it with the bandage mentioned earlier and apply pressure for five days.
Then it heals and the hand becomes rigid with something in it, so immerse it in hot water and massage it repeatedly until it softens.
The Ninth and Tenth Chapters.
Treatise on the Dislocation of Fingers.
Treatment of Dislocation of Fingers: When a finger gets dislocated either to the outer or inner side of the hand, measure its length and straighten it with your forceps until it returns to its place. Then, tie the end of the finger and suture it towards the direction it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release and extend it until it settles on its own on the third day. If it is at night, tie it according to the same procedure, but do not keep it bound during the day. Let it be free during the day and exercise it with movement, then bind it again at night. Repeat this process for several days until it heals completely.
And the same treatment applies if it gets dislocated towards the inside of the hand, tie it in the direction of the same side and perform the same procedure as before until it returns to its place. Similarly, do the same when it gets dislocated to any other direction.
The Thirtieth Chapter.
Treatment of Dislocation of Shoulder Joint: If it gets dislocated, hold the patient's arm firmly and press his shoulder with your hand from below while applying traction force on the upper part of the arm with a rope or similar tool until it returns to its place. Then tie it to prevent recurrence of the dislocation.
When a shoulder joint or neck is dislocated and the dislocation cannot be reduced, there is no treatment since death is imminent.
The sign of this (condition) is that a pustule appears without intention, which cannot be grasped and often drains from it some of its parts, either fingers or arms or one of them, and if the pustule remains stationary, it often discharges.
The discharge from it can go to four directions, the one that drains towards the back is called a boil, and as for its treatment, if the boil has occurred due to scabies then there is no cure in it or relief from it, but if it has occurred due to falling or hitting etc.
He mentioned it in the early stages with a long speech, which does not exceed much benefit, I have shortened from that what is sufficient for understanding and explanation of its meaning and representation of the tool contrary to what it shows and explains it.
If a boil occurs in the chest, there is no remedy for it or relief from it and likewise for those on both sides, but treatment is applied only to those that occur on the back, specifically as I described, which is to apply the lancet onto it.
On a raised platform near the wall, spread something underneath it and moisten it so as not to hurt his chest, then place an upright piece of wood in a hole in the ground next to the platform towards his head and another piece of wood towards his legs on the other side of the platform.
The first servant holds the piece of wood that is not fixed in the hole, and the other servant holds the second one on this position, then strike the patient's chest and cover it with a soft and strong bandage, extending the edge of the bandage to the wood that is next to his head and tying him there.
Then tie the other bandage above his shoulders and across his back, near the nape of his neck, then gather all the bands and tie them to the other piece of wood that is next to his legs, then each servant holds a band towards their respective piece of wood without letting go of the pieces from their fixed positions in it.
The two pieces of wood are not fixed as we said, and the physician places his hands on the stretcher with force until it returns, or he puts a plank on it. Then he sits on the board with his legs until it returns. If it does not return by this treatment, he takes a board that is approximately three spans long.
Drill in the wall that we said should be near the vein, where you enter from one side of the board. Then place the board centrally over the vein and the physician's foot on the other side, and he shall strike forcefully until the vein is cut off.
Return to the place, and if you wish, make it with two wooden poles, one at the head of the vein near the ground in the corner of the room. At the end of these poles, there are also two more pieces of wood.
The space between each wooden pole should contain a groove, and a hole should be made in each pole for the catheter to pass through. All poles should be firmly fixed into the ground so that the bucket does not move and the rotating catheter can enter the holes of the wooden poles.
On one side of the bucket, there is a hole that has been bored in it, and a pole of similar length should be inserted into this hole. The same should be done for the other wooden poles as well. Then, tighten the cord that you tied at the source of the vein on the rotating catheter located at the top and the cords that you tied at the feet of the catheter on the lower one.
Then, stand by every boil. The attendant strikes it with a cupping glass which attracts the boil and the doctor presses on the abscess as we have described, and this is the image of the boil, the abscess and the suppuration.
Then, after the incision has been made and the position has been set, it is necessary to place the dry dressing with white linen, then apply ointment, followed by placing a bandage from a thin flat piece of wood, its width being three fingers or close to that, and its length corresponding to the size of the abscess.
On some correct ulcers, then bind with the bandage that is necessary, and use soft food until it heals. If some pus remains in the wound at the end of healing, it is necessary to use the medicines that soothe and soften, along with the blade as we have described for a long time.
And in such a case, a lead blade may be used, and it is possible that pus appears on the surface of the ulcers on the face, which is believed to be an abscess and become bone excess that has grown. In this case, do not apply this treatment as death might occur.
The thirty-first chapter.
In the treatment of the hernia that is protruding.
Know that the ligament of the hernia and the ligament of the inguinal canal only expose to the bite, and neither of them exposes to all types of swelling and sinking. The ligament of the hernia protrudes in four directions.
That is because it protrudes towards the inside and outside and towards the front and back, and it mainly protrudes towards the inside and less so towards the front or the back. A sign of protrusion towards the inside is that if you press the correct hand of the patient on the hernia, it will be longer.
The hernia is usually more mobile than the correct one, and it is not possible for the surgeon to separate the leg from the patient when he is lying on his back, and the location where the Arab patients lie with their arms folded in front of them, clearly indicates that the end of the bone has reached there.
The sign that the bite exposes to the outside is characterized by symptoms opposite to these symptoms, and the sign that the bite exposes to the front is that it spreads the leg completely, except that it does not separate it without pain being present in the hernia, and even if he walks, he cannot do so towards the front.
The bladder is strained and the stone is pushed towards the posterior part of the urethra. A sign that the stone reaches the bladder neck is that it cannot spread the back and cannot be crushed before the bladder is first crushed, and the urine stream will be shorter than usual.
The bladder is distended and the stone is located at the bladder neck. As for the types of this stone, it is to be noted that if the stone has been with its owner for a long time without attempts to pass it and remains in its state, there is no treatment for the stone.
Do not expose oneself to it. As for the one who has passed a stone of any type from the four directions of the urethra, it is advisable that the patient urinate and move the stone gently inward and outward until it is expelled with ease.
He returned without the need for any treatment other than this. If it does not return in this manner, it is necessary to have a strong attendant with one hand to hold him from below either by his hand or with a cord tied above the bladder and another assistant to pull it from above.
The hand should enter from below the navel, then he should tighten thin cords on the root of the finger, and a third person should hold one end of the cord. It may be extended either from the right side to the left or from the back to the front.
Each of them (the four types) should be extended once until the patient's body rises from the ground and remains suspended, for this type of extension is a shared characteristic among the four types. If the back does not return as we have said, then there is no choice but to apply the treatment specific to each type.
If the back returns specifically, it is necessary that the patient lies on his correct side, then cords are tied on the root of the finger between the tip of the finger and the navel area.
Then the cords are extended from the navel side to the upper part of the body towards the front, and a third person holds strong ropes with his hands and grasps the swollen area of the finger and extends it forcefully. When this is done, it returns to its place.
This type is easier than the other treatments for this limb, but if you find it difficult and you are unable to apply this method of treatment, then all the legs should be tied together with strong cords on the knees and ankles.
After each of them (the fingers), there should be a length of four fingers, and the little finger (of the hand) should be extended more than the others by two fingers. Then, tie the index finger to the top with a wooden peg that is kept in the house, followed by a distance of two forearms.
Then, order a strong servant to hold the neck of the bone (leg) and tie it with the index finger. Let another servant pull the bone (leg) held by the first servant forcefully. In case the fracture returns to its original position, if the fractured part is outside the body.
The index finger should be laid on the splint as described in the section of the broken bone, and the laces should be tightened around it specifically at its neck and chest. Then, place one wooden piece under his legs and another at his head. Place a third wooden piece firmly fixed in the center of the splint.
If a fracture occurs on it (the bone), make the splint wet so that it does not hurt the index finger and place the wooden piece between his fingers to prevent it from moving downwards during movement. Then, each servant should move in their respective directions and the doctor adjusts the bandage with his hand. If it returns to its original position.
Unless [the operation] is on the side of health, place the blade and bind it in the manner as we have described in the Hadabah (a type of surgical ligature), except that it is desirable for the patient to be anesthetized on the affected side. If the incision is made in front, then the patient's limb should be stretched by pulling it once, and this description applies to the surgeon looking directly at the wound.
The surgeon places his left hand on the affected artery, then presses it with the other hand while exerting a continuous pressure that moves downwards towards the heel (of the foot). If the incision is made behind, stretching the limb downwards should not be done.
The patient should be placed on a firm surface, and it is desirable for him to be secured with bands at the ankle and waist as we have described in our previous discussion of ligatures, which applies to both the surgeon's left and right hands while performing the operation.
In the location where the severed artery has emerged, use a ligature to bind it, and if the severed vein returns, as indicated by the limb stretching, this should not be concealed from you; stretch the patient's limb.
If you see them [the fractured bones] level, and the upper one is pulled back without any force, then know that the limb has returned to its proper state. At this point, align the bones and apply a splint tightly so that the fracture does not move in any direction.
The upper bone should be immobilized for three or four days, then the splint and bandages are removed, and the limb is straightened with the other one. If they appear equal in position, know that the fracture has healed. Release the upper bone to walk. However, if you see any sign of deformation.
Return and immobilize it again, tighten the splint as before, and leave it for three days, then release it to walk on it for a few days until it strengthens, by God's will.
The second and third sections.
On the treatment of fractured bones.
A fracture occurs in three directions: it breaks inward, outward, and downwards, meaning towards the back, not toward the front of the limb. A sign of a fracture is when the upper bone requests that the lower one be grasped with its hand.
If it does not adhere to the bone, know that the fracture is dislocated, and apply traction on all sides until it sits down, and if it has strength to do so, let the patient sit on a chair with his affected leg hanging down. Then, have an assistant behind him to hold and pull it slightly towards the back. Then, you sit on the fractured leg.
Place your back to his face and make him stand between your legs, then hold onto his fractured leg with both hands, interlocking your fingers around it. Then, pull the fracture towards your side with strength, while another assistant pushes his leg until the fracture returns to its original position.
If it returns to its place smoothly, tie it and let the bone attach to the leg. Then, bind them all with a splint for three or four days, then release them. Do not walk on it except a little until it gets stronger.
If it is difficult for you to return it as described, use strong traction with the splints mentioned in the treatment of dislocations until it returns.
The third and thirtieth chapter.
In treatment of dislocation of the shoulder.
On the reduction of dislocated shoulder. The shoulder joint may dislocate easily and require complete reduction, which could be either back to its original position or out of it. A sign of successful reduction is that the shoulder appears swollen towards the direction to which it was dislocated.
As for the treatment of a dislocated shoulder, it is easy to reduce it by applying pressure with hands and gently manipulating until it returns to its original position. If the shoulder has been completely dislocated, the patient should sit up straight and hold onto a strong assistant standing behind him in the middle.
Then grab your right hand at the top of its foot and your left hand at the bottom of its foot in a standing position, then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, then push it gently away from you with your left hand while pulling it backwards with your right hand without force.
Do this procedure twice as described, then push the heel towards the buttock in the third movement while you pull up on the ankle. If it returns at any point during these movements or within two movements like this and you find the foot level, continue with the same procedure. Otherwise, repeat the process until it does return, for it will eventually do so.
If you prevent its return as we have described, otherwise lay the patient on his back on the ground and tie him firmly to the earth so it happens between his legs where a wound has been made, but he does not feel it, then the attendant ties the leg.
Then the attendant moves the other leg, either with his hand or with a rope tying it around the neck of the patient, then each attendant pulls in opposite directions and the attendant holding the affected leg keeps it upright to prevent the body from moving down due to the pull, then the doctor straightens the fracture with his hand.
Then the other attendant holds the healthy leg down because the fracture will return quickly, if the fracture returns and it is clear to you that it has returned correctly, then take the bandages and the splints and tie them firmly with ropes and bind the foot with the rope towards the bottom. It is important to be cautious of the nerve that may be behind the heel.
Ensure that the rope is not too tight so as not to hurt him, then leave it for a few days or three. If the rope loosens, tighten it and then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If a fracture of the leg occurs before this period, it will not be secure enough for the tooth to affect it or spoil, and no treatment will be effective afterwards. If heated iron is applied to it (the fracture), it must be cooled down with what we have previously described as being used in a situation other than healing and traction until it subsides.
The fourth and thirty-first section.
On the treatment of a fracture in the fingers of the leg.
It is necessary to splint the fractured part of the fingers with a gentle material that is not a bone, and this is easy rather than difficult. If the fracture is in some parts of the palm of the foot, it is necessary for the patient to put his foot on an even place on the ground.
Or on a flat surface, and stand like you are walking, then place your foot on one of the splints, then grasp it with your foot and press it firmly until it returns to its original position without any movement being visible.
Then place a flat object under the sole of his foot to hold the entire foot firmly, then tighten it strongly and securely for three days, then release it and let him walk for many days until it recovers and the return is safe, God willing.
Chapter Fifty-Third.
Types of Fractures that Occur Alongside Injury or Break, or Both Together.
When such a thing occurs and treatment is attempted, it often ends in death.
Therefore, it should not be attempted to treat such cases except by a skilled person with long experience, sharp and precise eyes, no tremor, no trembling of the hands, no shaking, and he must use in the beginning only drugs that relieve acute inflammation, and leave it to its fate.
May Allah grant the ability, except for what I hope for safety from pain with a slight illness and you appear in it with some hope; formulate your response from your time before the inflammation occurs.
If the limb returns to its normal state, administer the treatment that relieves acute inflammation and heals injuries with suitable cauterization. If the fracture occurred in the bone with clean shards, extract them. This applies similarly to what we have discussed under simple diseases when dealing with their locations.
Exert your effort, beware of entering the path of destruction for what you are dealing with, and my advice to you is to leave it alone and submit to its fate, if Allah wills.
