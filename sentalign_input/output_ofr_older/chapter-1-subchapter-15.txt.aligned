When the eyelid is softened by disease and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery called "olivare". of which this is the shape:	When an eyelid droops either from disease or humidity, then burn the lid with a single cauterization with this crescent-shaped cautery.	0.6090859
And if you want, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are; and do not leave the hand there except just long enough for the third part of the eyelid to be burned, according to the manner that I have said.	And if you wish burn him also a little above the eyebrows with two cauterizations (; that is, one) on each side; but keep clear of the temples; and let each cauterization be of the length of the eyebrow. Nor let your hand apply the cautery longer than to burn a third of the way through the skin.	0.76238894
