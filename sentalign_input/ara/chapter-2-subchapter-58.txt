Chapter Fifty-Eight.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage from a stone, clotted blood, pus, or growth of tissue, and the like. If you have treated it with the various treatments we described in the section,
and the urine has not been released, and you believe that its retention is due to a stone that has become lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary to have the patient kneel on his knees, then someone should mount his back, stretch his belly towards his back, and have the patient hold himself as much as he can.
The neck of the bladder will then be forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine will be released. If it is not released by what we have described, and the patient's condition worsens, it is necessary to use the instrument called a catheter to extract it, which is depicted here:.
It is made of silver, and it is thin, smooth, and hollow, like a bird's feather quill in its thinness and length, about a span and a half long, with a delicate funnel at its head.  The way to draw urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie good knots with wool or cotton at its end.
Insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors any excess wool so that it enters the tube and plugs it like a button. Then lubricate the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white and have the patient sit on a chair.
Anoint his bladder and urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water, then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside it.
Once the urethra is bent, push the catheter inside until, when it reaches near the anus, tilt the penis downwards with the catheter inside, then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has reached an empty space.
It is made in this manner because the passage through which urine flows has curves. Then pull the thread with the wool gently, and the urine will follow the wool.  Then remove it and the urine will pour out.  Reinsert the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
