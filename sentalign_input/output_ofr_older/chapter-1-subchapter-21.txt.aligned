of the pain of the teeth	On cauterization for toothache.	0.41346204
When tooth pain comes from cold, or there is cold or wind, and the medicine treatments do not help, then a cautery is needed in two ways: with butter or with fire.	When the toothache arises on account of cold, or if there be a worm in the tooth, and medical treatment does not avail, then cauterization should be undertaken. There are two ways of doing this, one with butter, the other with the cautery.	0.77770996
The butter cautery is done by taking cow's butter and melting it in an iron or brass spoon; then take cotton and wrap it on the tip of a stick, soak it in the melted butter, and apply it quickly to the aching tooth and hold it until it cools; do this often until the effect reaches the root of the tooth, and if you want, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a hot iron on it until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.	Cauterization with butter is done thus: take cows' butter and let it boil in an iron ladle or pan; then take cotton wool, wind it round the top of a probe, and dip it in the boiling butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth and hold it there till cold. Repeat this a number of times till the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. If you prefer, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and put it on the aching tooth, then on top of that apply the hot iron until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.	0.9303105
