The treatment of canker sores by cauterization
When a canker sore first appears, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all the way around the canker sore. 
And yet, the wise say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the canker sore; however, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it may become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen this happen sometimes; and it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around it, with the cautery called "circular," as we have said regarding cauteries.
