When there is a bowel disorder due to cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive faculties in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and it cannot be treated by usual methods; and you see the patient enduring and of strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach as mentioned earlier with the circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the navel with a subtle clavile cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.	When the diarrhoea is due to frigidity and humidities so that the capacity of the stomach and intestines to hold and to digest is impaired, and this has been treated by various methods and is not cured; if you see that the patient is able to endure the cautery and is of unimpaired strength, make a big cauterization on his stomach according to the preceding instructions for cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery; and four narrow cauterizations round his navel with the thin claviform cautery; and one or two big cauterizations in the lumbar region over the coccyx.	0.91224986
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient is enduring, make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each side, and two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one, because the treatment is effective when there is good help.	And if you see that the humidities are superabundant, and the patient fit to tolerate it, then make one cauterization over the groin and one over the hypochondrium. You may also add two small ones over the stomach near the big one. This is an effective treatment that does not fail to help.	0.7784283
