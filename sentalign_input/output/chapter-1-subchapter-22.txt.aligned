When extrophulos are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to digestive medicines, and you want to digest them quickly, heat the concave cautery, which should have two open ends for smoke to escape. Apply the heated cautery to the abscess once, or as needed, until it reaches the base of the abscess.	When the tumours arise from phlegm and cold humidities and are not to be dispersed with medicines and you wish for a rapid dispersal, then heat the hollow cautery of which this is the figure. It is open at both ends to give exit for the fumes of burning from the other end. Place it hot, right on the tumour, once, or twice if need be, till you reach the bottom of the tumour.	0.74928004
If the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, leave it for three days, and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burnt tissue is removed.
