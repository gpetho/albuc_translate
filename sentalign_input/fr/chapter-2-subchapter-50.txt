Of the abscesses of the nerves
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and vein, abscesses can occur in the nerves when they are struck, or from too much work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the joints and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in many cases without pain;
and when it is pressed firmly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but just under the surface;
and it moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, nor below nor above, and the one in the joints should not be cut with a knife: there could be a contraction;
and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
If the abscess is small, hold it with pliers, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, peel it, then remove it and sew the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
