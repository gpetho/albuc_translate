Chapter 48.
On the perforation of abscesses that occur under the armpit.
These abscesses that occur under the armpit are of the kind of scrofulas, hard, which contain a sack-like membrane.
And some of them contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be incised with a lunar cut in this form: from line .G. to line .B. And when all the pus in the abscess is evacuated, then you fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.
Then the cotton is removed and treated with a suitable ointment for that until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and scrofulas, then you incise over it as we said in the section on scrofulas likewise.
But if the wound extends to where there is decay, then apply the cautery as we previously said.
