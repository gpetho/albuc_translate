After having provided you with the book, O Son, which is the final part of the science in medicine including its complement and following completion of it, according to its exposition and my own explanations, I find it necessary for me to provide it all to you together with this Treatise which is a part of operations that is surgery with practice.
Since the operation with hands is located in our region and time, and has been completely neglected for a while until perhaps knowledge of it disappears and its investigation ceases, leaving behind only fragmentary descriptions from ancient books altered by human intervention, resulting in error and hesitation until their intentions are fully formed and their force elongated. I find it necessary to revive it using the structure of this Treatise, according to exposition, declaration, and abbreviation. And to be familiar with the forms of Cauterius's tools and other equipment of the operation; an addition comes from declaration and the need that arises from its investigation.
The reason for why a skilled practitioner of surgery using his own hands is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and one needs to engage in the author's training before that in the science of anatomy as narrated by Galen, until he understands the functions of members, their forms, their union and separation, and has knowledge about bones, nerves, vessels, their numbers, their egresses, and pulsating veins and quiet veins, and the places where they exit.
And because of this, Hippocrates said that the name with a name is much and with work little, and especially in the art of hands.
We have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
For one who does not understand what we have said about anatomy will inevitably fall into error when practicing medicine, just like I have seen many of those who are being trained in this science, boasting about it without knowledge and without experience.
What happened was that I saw a physician neglect an indurated lump on the neck of a woman and pierce some arteries in her neck. Consequently, blood flowed from the woman until she died between his hands.
And I saw another physician who thought to extract a stone from the urinary passage of an old man, and the stone was large.
He therefore went to him and extracted it along with part of the bladder.
As a result, the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had already been called upon to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was treating a claimant to land in our realm due to his medical skills: and it happened that there was a black eunuch who was with him, having suffered a break near the ankle, close to the heel. And when this doctor acted with his ignorance, he bound up the fracture over the wound with lint balls and pins, using a tight binding, without allowing the wound to breathe.
Then, according to his wishes, he discharged him.
Later, he discharged him after a few days and warned him not to untie the bandage. He stood like that until his leg and foot developed an indurated lump. Eventually, this led to his downfall.
I was therefore called to him and approached to untie the bandage; peace followed, and he was relieved of his pains.
However, corruption had already set in within the limb, and I could not arrest it.
So then the corruption began to roam through the body until its death.
And I saw another surgeon who had pierced a cancerous pustule: and it became inflamed for days until the severity of its mischief withstood its master.
Which is why, when there is a pure cancer originating from a melancholic humour, then it should not be reached with the iron at all, unless it's located in a limb capable of bearing it, in which case the whole thing needs to be removed.
And because of this, you children need to know that an operation with the hand is divided into two parts: namely, one which associates with health, and one which involves danger in various dispositions. And I have already highlighted throughout this book where an operation is used that involves fear and dread.
Therefore, you must be careful about this and abandon it: so that the foolish do not find a way to speak and become disgraced.
So receive this advice with concern and protection, and treat your sick patients with ease and strength, and use the better way that leads to salvation and a commendable succession: and remove terrible illnesses difficult to heal. And free yourself from what makes you afraid, so that doubt does not enter into your faith and welfare when it comes to you. Indeed, staying true is more glorious for you, and it is higher among the things in this world, and finally it pertains to your quantities.
Galen had indeed said this in some of his own instructions. Do not heal the bad sickness: do not call yourself the healer of evil.

Part I.
Regarding the benefit and harm of cautery: to which compositions it is suitable, at what time: whether with iron or gold.
Head I.
But before recalling the operations with it, it must be said what qualities of benefits and harms it has, and in which composition they appear.
I therefore say that the discussion about the quality of benefits and harms from cautery is a lengthy and subtle topic, requiring knowledge and secrets hidden within.
And there have been many wise men speaking on this topic, disagreeing amongst themselves. I find it sufficient to share only a little from their words, fearing that it might become lengthy.
I therefore say that the cautery applies universally to all compositions, whether they are with matter or without matter. Two exceptions though; a hot composition without matter, and a dry composition without matter.
In the composition however, when heat and dryness disagreed with the matter.
Some have said that the cautery is beneficial in such cases.
And others said the opposite of that, namely, that a cautery is not suitable in dryness which comes from heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat, and it would be incompatible to heal from the warmth and dryness with the warmth and dryness.
And he who says the opposite of that one said: That through the cautery an improvement is made in all dryness and warmth which happens in human bodies: for when you compare the body of a man with its moisture to the composition of fire, you find the body of a man to be cold.
And indeed I say this through his words: for that has been shown to me by experience on several occasions.
However, one should not apply it unless they have already been proven and practiced in the chapter of the Cautery exercise at the end, and have understood the diversity of human compositions, the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, as well as the circumstances surrounding them, and the duration of these.
With respect to other compositions, there is no fear for you: particularly in cold and moist illnesses. Indeed, all doctors have now agreed on them: and they did not disagree about improvement with the cautery in these.
And know sons, that from the secret of healing through the cautery with fire, and its advantage over the cautery with burning medicine is as follows: for fire is simple, whose action does not reach unless to the member being cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined to it, unless in a minor injury.
The medicinal action when applied causes an extension from the limbs, and perhaps it may result in causing difficulty of healing within the member, or perhaps it could be lethal.
However, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, fire does not do this unless there is an excess.
Now indeed, through experience, we have come to understand this, because of the length and dedication to study alongside expertise, and position over truth in matters, and for that reason the excuse from the length of discourse.
And children, you should know that they disagree during the time when a cautery should be applied and prefer better times for truth.
And I say that a cautery is suitable at any time: therefore, the harmful effects due to time are submerged in the benefit that is drawn out with the cautery.
And especially if a cautery is for pain due to necessary, strong, sudden pains that do not tolerate delay; therefore, one fears the occurrence of a mischief which is greater than the small harm caused by delay out of time.
And do not let this thought fall into your minds, children, that they do not understand, unless it is the common and foolish doctors, namely that they do not think that every disease cured by a cautery always has a return: and they propose these consequences, and it is not as they imagine: therefore, a cautery is not instead of medicine, which alters complexion, and removes moisture which causes pain.
However, the cautery is useful compared to medicine because of the speed of his health and the strength of his operation, and the intensity of his domain: and it is possible that he recovers from sickness for an hour or so according to the constitution of the weak one, and the location of his sickness, and the strength of him: and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities in it: and what comes to him in acquisition through food, and similar things from causes, unless there is sickness when the cautery administration takes place. Subtle illness in a limb from few superfluities and moisture, like the cautery on teeth due to pain, is possible. For indeed, that pain may not recover in it.
But this happens in few cases.
But the term refers again to the fact that cautery is the last resort of medicine, which is a correct statement: not towards what they aim for in it; because they believe there is no cure that comes with medicine or after the application of cautery.
However, this is contrary to that notion and its purpose; that cautery is the last resort of medicine isn't true unless when we have tried various methods for curing illnesses and they don't yield results with medications. Then we apply cautery at the end of all procedures, which does produce results then. Thus it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to how the common people and many doctors understand it.
Ancient people said that the cautery made with gold is better than one made with iron. They did not say this merely because of the equality of gold and the quality of its substance but they also stated that it does not produce pus in the area where the cautery is applied. But this is not absolutely true: for I have already tested that thing, and found that it does not cause that effect in some bodies without others.
And the cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you heat the cautery in fire made from gold, it does not become evident to you, when heated according to how much you wish, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches to a cold state, and if you add fire upon it, it melts in the fire and transforms into sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman falls into occupation from this: and because of this, we have a cautery with iron that is faster and closer, in terms of direction towards action.
And indeed, I have already arranged this chapter on the cautery according to chapters, and organized it from head to feet so that anyone seeking can find what they want. Section: On the method of applying the cautery, Chapter on coronal incision.
Title II.
This cautery treatment relates to the influence of humidity and coldness on the brain: these two are the causes of sweating, and the multitude of bodily fluids flowing from the head to the eyes and ears, and the multitude of dreams, toothaches, and throat pain: universally, all illnesses that occur due to coldness, such as paralysis, sweats, epilepsy, and similar illnesses resulting from sickness.
The method of cautery application is to prescribe this treatment to the sick: so that it begins with cleansing medicine for the head on three or four nights, depending on what the strength of the patient requires, and their age, and their habits.
Then instruct him to shave his head along with the beard.
Then have him sit between your hands in a square formation, so that his hands are already on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm over the base of his nose between his eyes. And wherever your middle finger goes, mark that spot with an indelible sign. Then apply oil from the cautery: this is how it should be done. Then place him over the marked spot with an indelible mark, applying pressure gradually with your hand and you rotate him.
Then quickly raise your hand, and you will see the spot.
If you see that the amount of alkali has leaked out from the bone through the mouth or the quantity of herb, then raise your hand.
And if not, apply your hand with the iron, or use another that has been cooled beforehand: until you see the bones I told you about.
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, then soak the affected area, and place it on the spot; and release him for three days.
Then place the butter-soaked affected area on him, and release him to the spot until the blistering scar is destroyed. Then care for it with the fourfold ointment until it is healed.
They have said that the longer the wound remains open, the more pus it discharges; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the skin should be burned down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of thickness begins to burn.
Then it is cut after that which has been made smooth from bone, and then it is treated.
And others say that it is necessary to arrive at the end with the cauterizer until a mark of a tooth impression appears, so that the mouth falls as if it were shaped like a kirate: or an instrument that women place immersed in the shape of a small letter 'a': and they think that the head vapors escape from this spot, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then it is treated until the healing process is completed.
To me, these two kinds of cauterization do not seem entirely distinct unless in certain individuals according to the way of fear.
And to release it myself, for me is better with regard to his health.
For the head weakens through dissolution of its natural continuity: as we have testified with other limbs; and especially when the head itself is naturally weak: and indeed the first kind of cauterization seems more beneficial and better to me, and I use it: so that therefore I act with it for health.
Section 13: On the method of cauterizing the head in total headache.
Head III.
When a chronic headache affects the entire head: and this lasts in the sick person, and they use heat treatments, warm baths, head washes, oils, and massage.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cauterization, as we have described, and nothing from that is effective for him; then consider the situation.
For if the head is strong by nature of its creation and is not weak, and finds cold relief: then cauterize with another cauterization under that to some extent.
Then, after that, apply a cautery to his head on all of its horns, so that the skin does not tear through and the quantity accessible from bone is uncovered as we have described.
Then apply the cautery to him on his head exactly at the point named 'uas': this is the place where a windpipe is placed: lift your tool here and do not uncover the mouth.
Indeed, he has found this because of the severe pain and something different from the pain caused by other more extensive head surgeries.
And I will say that this is the Cautery at its place: and it should be a cautery with which horns of the head are treated, and the back part (occiput) needs to be done more carefully with a finer cautery, where the middle part of the head gets cauterized.
And this is its form.
Regarding the method of applying cauterization on one half of the head, whether with heated medicine or metal.
Head IV.
When pain and heat occur in part of the head or extends to the eye, and the head is treated with purifying medicines, and then other treatments are administered as described in the divisions of illnesses. This does not encompass it completely: in such a situation, cauterization is performed in two ways: either by applying cauterization with an acute burning medicine, or using iron. The cauterization with an acute burning medicine involves taking one tooth or another, and removing the rest of it, cutting off its extremities from both sides.
Next, divide the pain site while being accompanied by a broad bloodletter until you create a spot beneath the skin where the tooth will be extracted.
Therefore, insert him under the skin until it is hidden; then bind him with a binding suitable for an ointment, and remove him after fifteen hours, then let him off for two or three days. Afterwards, place a clove submerged in butter over him until pus forms at the site: thereafter treat him with ointment until he has fully recovered.
And if someone performs this (procedure) with certain physicians who burn, as I wrote in my twelfth treatise, about those who are burnt medicinally.
But the cauterization with iron is according to this manner.
Fire cautery, whose form is thus.
And it is called the Key: because its head's form resembles that of a key, where there is some curvature, and in the middle of it, there is a small prominence.
Then place it on the spot and hold your hand: and you should gradually move the iron with speed. And let the amount of what is burned be according to the thickness of the skin, as half of its width.
And raise your hand so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and there is a flow of blood.
Then soak the cauterized area in salt water, and place it over the spot, and let it heal for three days. Then apply it with butter: afterwards take care with ointment until it is fully healed. And if you wish, perform this hemi-cranial cauterization with the second surgical tool of cautery.
And be cautious about making an incision near the artery in this hemi-cranial area, not too close to its original position.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterization in an old hemi-cranial region.
Head V.
When you treat a hemi-cranial area, follow the treatment procedures we have discussed previously and those concerning divisions of illnesses; if the treatment does not suffice, observe the illness to determine that what was said about the first cautery with medicine or fire is insufficient. Then it's necessary to use the surgical tool of cautery until the area becomes white after signs of pain with a line on it whose length is half a finger, or similar to this description. Hold your hand one way only and press it until you reach an artery and proceed until you arrive at its source. However, you must beware of the continuity of the jaw bone which moves during chewing, so as not to burn the side or the nerve that moves it, thereby causing cramps.
And be mindful of the care and caution regarding the flow of blood in the artery that has been severed.
Indeed, the risk is high during amputation, especially for those who do not understand what they are doing and are neither diligent nor experienced. It would be best to avoid performing such an operation with someone like that at first.
And I take caution when remembering the situation of blood flow accidents due to severing an artery according to its manner and place, within this book.
If you see due to illness that it does not suffice him this cautery, and if you see an infirm body enduring the cautery in the middle of its head, as we narrated, take care of the wound until it heals.
And if you see fit, administer the cautery, which we spoke about in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery that has two knives.
Indeed, this type of cautery is better and more effective. ### On the method of applying cautery in ear pain.
Chapter VI. When ear pain occurs due to cold, and it is treated with oils that are rubbed into the area, along with the other treatment we discussed for dividing (ear) issues, but if the pain does not subside, then apply fire cautery: this is what is called a 'Punctum', whose form is as follows.
Next, after igniting the 'Punctum', apply it around the entire area of the ear as described, or around both sides if pain is present in both ears.
And lengthen yourself with a cautery from the root of the ear moderately, after you have marked the places with an applicator: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points throughout each ear, and roughly so.
And then attend to the areas until they heal.
¶ On the method of cauterization by means of torture.
Head VII.
The kind of torture that heals with cauterization is only due to the species which happen from putridity, as we said in our divisions of diseases. And the proper cauterization for the species which happens from drying out and nerve spasm.
When you are treating this species of torture with hot baths and purges, and gargling, if your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient three times: once at the root of the ear, and secondly a little lower than its proper place, and thirdly at the junction of both lips.
And apply your cautery from the opposite side of the diseased part.
Since healing does not occur unless on the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is to apply the cautery with a tool directly at the tip of the upper ear below the horn of the head a little bit: and on another part, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
And hold your hand with the cautery until the amount that is half the thickness of the skin burns.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species from that made by knives, whose form has been mentioned previously: but it should not be less narrow than what you see; and it must have a knife in it with a slight excess of thickness. Then care for the places, until it is healed.
In the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Title VIII.
When apoplexy hardens, and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not suit, and the patient doesn't have a fever, then apply four cauterizations on all parts of his head, and perform a cauterization in the middle of his head as we have said, and do a cauterization at the back of his head according to what has preceded: and the degree of cauterization should be according to what has preceded.
And even with the cauterization above the stomach's mouth: and this is more extreme.
Then it heals, as what has preceded.
In the method of cauterization in Omission.
Title IX.
It is necessary to use large doses of ghee (hyerae) at first for the sick person and pills that purify the brain.
Then shave the whole head of the sick person and put on the back of his head the plaster described with respect to snail (synapi) as written in the book about plasters, and apply it several times. Indeed, that is the measure of cauterization: and do that according to the same order which I said there. If it is healed by this, then it is good.
If it doesn't heal, then do to him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which descend from the upper part of his head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Then comes the care of the cautery, with that which precedes it.
And if there is an addition [to the injury], and the sick person can tolerate it: then do to him a cautery in the middle.
And if there is an additional [injury]: then apply the cautery over both horns.
Then care for it until it heals: and apply the cautery with oil according to the manner that was previously described.
¶ Concerning the method of applying the cautery for paralysis and softening.
Title X.
It is necessary for you to proceed with head shaving and with what we have said about it.
Then shave the sick person's head: afterwards apply the cautery in the middle of the head, and over all the horns of the head, and over his buttocks, and three times on the neck joints.
And if you need it for body softening in many ways, and the sick person can tolerate it, and the sickness is strong: then apply the cautery four times over the vertebral joints, and with the last one until a great amount of flesh burns from his skin, and lift up your hand.
Then care for it until it heals: and apply oil to the cautery in this manner.
¶ Concerning the method of applying the cautery in Epilepsy.
Title XI.
Epileptics are not cauterized unless the epilepsy is due to phlegm. Therefore, you must shave his brain first when you bathe him, and with the rest of the treatment we have mentioned in the division: when the sick person is large, or can tolerate the intake of medicines.
If it is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then gargling and brain-cleansing mastications are given, before many days with the improvement of foods.
Next, cut his head, then apply the cautery to him with a single one in the middle of the head, as has been done previously in manner. And use another cautery at the back of his head, and over all the horns of his head, use the cautery.
If the sick is strong and can tolerate it, then apply the cauterization with the ones I said in the case of paralysis, and soften the body over the atlas vertebrae and the dorsal ribs: and let it be oiled with the olive according to the manner that has been done beforehand. If however the sick is a child, then place the cautery subtly, according to this manner.
¶ On the method of applying the cautery in Melancholy.
Chapter XII.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then apply the cautery with the ones we said in the case of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess leading to melancholy and there is a weakened body that is humid, then give him something in his drink that cleanses his brain, according to what was done in division: then cut the sick's head, and afterwards make a neat circular bandage out of linen as you would for a headband.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and let the sick person be held square from every side while sitting.
Then present the liniment. And it is more worthy from old bee's wax.
And warm it with a fire tempered by warmth, up to the measure that a finger can endure when it is introduced into it.
Then evacuate him inside his head in the middle of its circle, and release him until he cools down.
Perform this for the sick person once every week, together with their usual treatment until it improves, until they are healed.
Or if you have an arrow wound, cauterize him by making many small punctures on it; moreover hold your hand with the cautery: indeed let there be a smell of it.
For this is how the appearance of the cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Then put on him wool that has been soaked in butter or chicken fat.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing when the water is descending to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When you are told the beginning of water in the eye through the signs I mentioned in division, then begin and treat the patient with that which purifies his head.
And keep him away from all moisture, and have him bathe for several days while fasting.
Then instruct him to shave his head and cauterize himself in the middle of his head. Then, when the beginning of water descends in both eyes at the same time or from one eye, cauterize yourself twice with two applications of the cautery. If it's only one eye that has the beginning of water, then perform it from one side. Remove all veins and arteries under the skin during this process. Make sure the cautery marks are long in width compared to the time intervals. Be cautious not to allow any bleeding.
If you notice anything from it, immediately remove it with whatever medicine is possible: and I pardon using wisdom when extracting arteries and cutting them, as well as being cautious about bleeding.
And sometimes it is cauterized at the neck, between two bones, with two last cauterizations.
On the method of cauterization in ancient lacrimal ducts.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are old and constant, they are above veins and arteries which are in the manifest head externally. It is verified that this comes from excess of cold, phlegmatic substances: then apply cauterization with the same method as I have described for the descending water, mid-head cauterization, and two cauterizations at intervals, and two cauterizations at the neck between two bones.
And if there is need for an additional application, then apply cauterization to the entire side of the eye, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cauterizing tool.
On the method of cauterization in nasal mucus.
Chapter XV.
When you treat this condition, following what we have discussed about its division, and if the treatment does not match up: then proceed swiftly and administer infusions of astringent garlic for three nights. Afterwards, shave his head, and apply cauterization using a central cauterizer and an olive oil-based cauterizer.
Then apply cauterization with a chisel-shaped cauterizer for two times, above the eyebrows under the hair slightly.
And watch out to avoid the artery, do not hit it.
This is the form of the cauterizer called the Chisel.
On the method of cauterization for the softening of eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid of the eye softens due to illness or moisture, then apply cauterization to the eyelid with a single cauterizer, using a lunar cauterizer.
And if you need to bleed him, cauterize above the two eyebrows somewhat twice in every part: and let them be extended from each other by two intervals: and make the length of all the cauterizations according to the lengths of the eyebrows: and do not hold your hand with the cauterizer until the third eyelid, but rather according to how much is burned of the third eyelid.
And this is the form of cauterization according to this way of lunar cauterization.
The method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are turned inward and prick the eye. Chapter XVII.
Cauterization is done in two ways: either with an iron heated by fire, or with a cauterizing medicine that burns.
When using a cauterizing iron, advise the patient beforehand to remove their hairs if there are any that cleanse them, until they extend and align. If they prick him at his eyelid's edge: then hold his eyes closed with your finger so that they do not move until the cauterization takes effect.
When they have begun to heal and align, then place the patient's head on your breast. Next, mark the eyelids with a hot tool, in a pattern resembling a leaf of myrtle: and make the beginning of the mark near the hairs.
Then place it treated with egg white on the eye, or apply mucus from psyllium over the eye.
Next, use an iron to perform cauterization, which is done in this manner.
Then, cauterize over the pattern that you have marked repeatedly in various places, until the skin surface burns as much as a complete leaf of myrtle would cover.
And the sign of health for your work is: if you think that the eyelid of the eye has already contracted and hairs have been raised at the point of the eye.
Therefore lift your hand then: and let it be for three days.
Then place on it Clove with butter until the scab is eradicated.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals.
And if some hair returns after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then apply the cautery to that place again, as you did at first.
And if the hairs are at the bottom: then apply the cautery to it until they return to their natural place: and level them so that they do not prick the eye.
¶ Concerning the method of applying cautery with burning medicine in this case.
Chapter XVIII.
Do it to the sick person until they remove and level the hairs.
Make it out of cloth in the shape of a laurel leaf.
Then take from known soap, and from one that has not absorbed water from each separately the weight of an ounce or about this amount. Then grind these together with good grinding, so as not to cool it down.
Then from the paste that you have made from this, spread it over the piece of cloth like the shape of a laurel leaf, and place it on the eyelid(s) of one or two.
And place under the eye, a clove that has been immersed in egg white: and let the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine and press it somewhat.
And you should move yourself as often as you feel the sickness of the bite of medicine, because he has found his bite like fire.
While therefore he perseveres with what he has found to be his bite, then abandon the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the bite has ceased, then remove the medicine and wash your eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid lifting, as it would lift during contraction with fire or incision, it is well: and if not, then repeatedly apply medicine on top of it to the place where the medicine does not stick, and do not disparage until your operation equates and the eye contracts.
Then place on it the cōtum with butter until the dry skin is eradicated.
Next, treat it with the diaphanic ointment or another one until it heals.
And you must guard the last watch when operating, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after a day, and something from the hair fights in the eye, then repeatedly apply medicine to that place which softens from the eyelid properly, just as you did initially.
Then take care of it until it heals.
And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
And you will know that men's eyes vary in size and thinness.
Therefore, this is your consideration: do not conceal the straight path for him who has a desire for this art.
Section on the method of cauterization in lacrimal fistulas.
Head Nineteen.
When treating a Fistula, following what we discussed in the divisions of illnesses, if your treatment does not prove effective: then, it is necessary for you to cauterize it according to this manner.
Instruct the patient to lay their head on your chest, and have them hold their own head with one of their hands like this: so that it does not move or jolt when they are moving their head.
Then place the decoction on a wool cloth or psyllium jelly over their eye: then take the cautery, which has this shape.
Lie flat like a parrot's head, with the shape of a pipe made by carving from one end, as is made for a cautery: and if you wish to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to go upwards, try this.
However, this concave shape is better for your task.
Then place the then on it cautery which is lit very strongly.
And hold your hand near the cautery with it at the eye and towards the nose part, so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient: then place the cautery on the fatty area of the eye, and consume it.
If you have thus reached the beginning of your cautery up to the mouth, that will be well.
And if not: then apply the cautery once, or twice if you need it: and let that be done for three days.
Then place Cottum with butter, and care for it with drying ointment, until it heals. If forty days pass and it is not healed: then apply upon it a caustic medicine, until the mouth appears; and shave it according to how it grows in its chapter.
And there is another mode of cautery for a fistula, as some of the early ones said.
Go to the site of the fistula and close it up: then place into the wound a thin piece of camahan, that is, a thin tube, which has this form.
And pour into it a quantity of an ounce of melted lead, and hold your hand with the camahan in place well, and do not let the invalid move at all, so as not to cause him to sweat or have the molten lead come to his eye.
And it is necessary that you place on the invalid's eye Cottum (a substance) which has been infused in egg white or water.
For the lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with a marvelous cure.
If the fistula is healed as we said from cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer an opening of the nose, and return the fistula to the course of the nose, according to how it will naturally be in its own place.
### On the method of cautery for wounds in the lips.
Chapter XX.
Often wounds occur in the lip called "whiskers", and especially in the lips of children.
So when you treat these wounds, using what we discussed about the division of illnesses, if no healing comes from that, then apply a small cautery iron according to this form.
And let its curvature be according to the subtlety of the knife.
Then care for it with the crust until it heals.
Regarding the method of cauterization in a sinus of the mouth.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of teeth: afterward pus appears and bursts out. Afterwards it heals up again, but pus flows out again and a sinus is formed; then you should treat that one, and not make any treatment stick there, for when this happens, a burning cauterizer according to the amount which will fit into the sinus must be used.
Then insert the burning thing into the opening of the sinus, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its deepest point and end. Do this once or twice.
Then care for it afterwards, according to what we have said about the treatment until it is cured.
If therefore the cure is complete and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the rotten mouth according to what will come out from its head.
Regarding the method of cauterization in gums and softened teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum becomes soft due to moisture and teeth become loose, and you treat it with medicines without sticking any treatment there: then place the head of a sick person into your armpit.
Then use the cauterizing tool that will take this form afterwards, so you put a cannula on top of the tooth: and insert the burning cauterizer quickly in there: and hold your hand for a while until the sick person feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the teeth.
And raise your hand: then apply the cauterizer several times, according to your preference.
Then let the sick person fill their mouth with salty water, and hold it for an hour: and expel it.
For the tooth becomes firmly set, and the gums become softened and tightened, and the moisture that has gone bad is dried off.
Title XXIII.
When there is pain in the teeth due to coldness, or if it is already cold within the tooth itself, or due to worms, and no remedy works with medications: then you use the cauterizer on the tooth according to two methods: either a cauterizer mixed with butter: or a cauterizer with fire.
The cauterizer mixed with butter is such that you take the heated butter and apply it to the bulla (blister), in a copper or silver cup.
Then hold the point, and cover the tip of the needle with it.
Then immerse it in the heated butter: and place it on the painful tooth as quickly as possible, and hold it until the heat subsides: then apply it several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse the wool or the point in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth. And place a heated iron over it until the heat reaches deep into the cavity of the tooth.
The cauterization with fire is done by aiming towards an air pipe or iron tube. And there should be some thickness within its body so that the sharpness of the fire does not penetrate to the sick person's mouth.
Then apply the fire cauterizing instrument, whose shape will be that of a hook: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the cauterizing instrument cools down.
Do this repeatedly, for pain is alleviated, or it occurs on the same day, or on another.
And the patient should fill the mouth with the tip of that cauterizing instrument until it reaches his good tooth and hold it for one hour. Then he should spit it out.
This is the form of the cauterizing instrument.
Apply with any extremity according to what is possible: and this is the form of the cannula.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in strophyles.
Chapter XXIV.
When strophyles are caused by phlegm and the cold humors, and do not respond to treatments with simples or speed up their digestion, then apply the fire cauterizing instrument, which has this form.
Having two open ends, so that smoke leaves the cauterizing instrument through one end at the other: and place the ignited one over it once on a blister, and the second time if you need it until it reaches deep into the blister.
If the blister is small, then place the cauterizing instrument according to the size of the blisters.
Then let it off for three days, and place on it an infusion of butter until what was burned by the fire is relieved.
Then care for it with salve on the teeth until the form of the cannula heals.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in hoarseness and constriction of breathing.
Head XXV.
When dampness covers the pulmonary canal and especially when this is associated with a cold constitution, then the sick person must be treated initially using medicines that are well dissolved.
Then, cauterize him near the root of his throat at a depressed place: and be careful not to touch with the cauterizing tool either towards the throat or on the skin, unless something of it is required.
Then cauterize him with a different cauterizing tool at the junction of the neck with the last rib on its end: and let the cauterizing tool be like a key following the manner of the one that precedes it.
Then take care of him with what has preceded until he is healed.
§ On the method of cauterization in lung diseases and coughing.
Head XXVI.
When the cough and lung irritation are due to cold dampness, and the sick person does not have fever, nor tuberculosis, nor old irritation: then cauterize him with two cauterizations above the throat at depressed areas, gently and completely.
And use another cauterizing tool in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cauterizer be like the one that has preceded, in terms of shape.
And if you need your cauterization to be puncturing with a cauterizing tool that is called "The Point", whose shape precedes it in the process of ear pain puncturing: and let there be punctures from thirty points up until almost reaching elsewhere.
Then take care of him with what has preceded until he is healed. And now let there be a cauterizer having three branches: according to this shape.
Whereas the cautery is applied together with it, when you perform it in place of one threefold cautery.
Concerning the method of applying the cautery to the titillico (a surgical instrument), during the dislocation of the shoulder blade.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to wetness and does not return at its usual time after its dislocation until it has become accustomed to returning, then one must use a small movement to dislocate it as we have already testified that happens, then you should return the dislocation in the first instance.
Then the patient is supinated on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then raise the skin, which is inside the titillico up to your left hand's fingers with your thumb, and if the joint gets dislocated towards the insides.
Then, having two real cauteries with fire. And here is the form of that.
Then apply the cautery to the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and you will receive the figure of the cautery with four applications.
And sometimes a three-fold cautery is used for the cautery procedure which then results in a figure of the cautery with six applications. And there are true forms according to the subtlety of the tool being tested.
And this is the form of a cautery that has three parts.
Sometimes an additional method is added to this one, which results in eight cauteries.
Then place crushed plants with salt on the cautery.
Then ensure the patient remains calm so that the limb is not moved at any time until they are reassured.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper part, and it happens rarely, then burn him above the shoulder with a triangular cautery or by burning in multiple points.
And the joint becomes stable, and moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
Regarding the method of applying cautery to the Stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and much moisture occur in the Stomach until it is extracted from its composition, and discharges increase towards it, and continuous methods of treatment are not sufficient: then it is necessary that the patient be placed on his back, and spread out his legs, and stretch out his hands.
Then apply the treatment with three cauteries: a triangular cautery of the size of a finger under the cochlea of the chest, and a triangular cautery on the clavicle, and two more below from each side of one cautery until the figure of the more advanced cauterization appears.
And lengthen between the two so that they do not join when pus is being made. And let the depth of the cautery be equal to twice and a third of the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the more advanced cautery be as this pattern without addition: and if you want to apply a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this pattern: and let there be one cautery which does this cautery according to the shape of the circle according to this pattern.
And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it with that which recoils from this cautery: and it happens like so; signs are placed on top of the stomach's point according to the amount you use with an incense stick: then apply it with a puncture cautery, then treat it with treatment which preceded until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing The outer ear.
Title XXIX.
When pain occurs in the Ear due to coldness and moisture, or from strong winds, until it leaves her natural constitution, and the patient is treated as we have said, but does not benefit from that: then it should be covered by the patient on his neck, and three applications of heat are made according to this form, and the same quantity below the outer ear, where the arm reaches, under the chin: and there should be a space between each application equal in width to the thickness of a finger: and make an application according to the length of the body straight: and do not press your hand with the heat for too long.
And let the quantity of what burns be equal to the thickness of the skin, and not more than half: and let the patient stand on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs and lifted up his arms. This is the form of cauterization.
And indeed, it is possible for you to apply these cauterizations with a surgical tool when you possess skill and prudence in the art.
And guard yourself so as not to proceed too far in cauterization, and the thickness of the skin gets burned everywhere, causing the whole body to be burned, and it reaches the intestines: because there is thinness there, you understand that.
On the method of cauterizing otorrhoea (discharge from the ear).
Title XXX.
When discharge occurs, and you need to know if that pustule is inside the flesh of the ear or within its covering. If it's inside the ear's flesh, the patient will experience pain and heaviness without sharpness: and if it's within the ear's covering, accompanied by pain, there is sudden sharpness: and you can see that his treatment by the doctors has already exhausted him.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient elevate upon his neck.
Next, create the position of an apostle with wax: then use the cautery tool that resembles a rod.
And this is its form.
And when you have this form, use one cautery tool until the entire skin is burned and reaches the siphon until the unhealthy part has completely come out. Then take care of it with healing procedures until it heals completely.
And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery tool, except for those whose expertise in the art of medicine extends: and when such illnesses present themselves with occasional experience: then he may venture upon such operations.
But rather to dismiss it myself, this is better for me.
§ On the method of cauterization for pleurisy.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said that the cautery with roots of Aristolochia should be used for cold pleurisy in this manner.
And you should take one long root from the dry roots of Aristolochia, a longer root which can be found there, and it should resemble the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil: and then light it on fire.
Then use a single cautery tool on the area between the throat and neck, and apply two smaller co-planar cauteries slightly inclined downwards to the part under the beard.
And apply two more cauteries also on the area between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly inclined downwards towards the back. And use another cautery in the middle of the chest, and yet another above the stomach.
And three burnings from the back: one where there is between two spoons: and two burnings from both sides of the chest, with the lower burning that is between the two spoons.
And it should not happen to compress your hand with the iron, rather there should be a noticeable smell of skin while it is being burnt. And some of the ancients have said that there are people who use a tool similar to a needle made from iron and apply it with fire. They insert it inside where there is space between the ribs, until they reach the pustule with it, and it emerges after healing: as we explained about the pustule in Epatis.
But with this puncture and using the iron, there is fear that either the patient dies immediately or a窦 opens up in the location which does not have healing.
§ On the method of cauterization of the Splenum Head - Chapter 32.
When you are treating splenic discomfort, according to what we have discussed regarding the treatment of diseases and if your treatment does not produce results, then there is a need for a third method of using the iron on it. All these three methods are correct.
One of these involves making three or four burns lined up according to the length of the spleen in the shape of the burn as described by Epatis, which precedes this figure.
And let there be between every burn the thickness of a finger, or more or less.
And the method of applying heat should be the same as what we have described for the ironing technique in Epatis.
And do not press your hand with the iron; and have the patient lying down on their back.
Another method for cauterization is as follows: having two genuine burning irons, as we mentioned in the chapter on shoulder dislocation. Lift the skin which is directly over the spleen, where the left arm reaches up to its elbow. And have your lifting motion lift the skin according to the width of the body so that the burns fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert two heated needles until you enter the skin from one side; then remove the cautery. Therefore, four cauterizations are made. And if you have to cauterize with another cautery having three needles.
Then care for the patient after you remove the cautery, allowing it to emit pus for many days: because it is more intense than all the rest that have preceded from treatment.
§ On the method of cauterization in Hydropsy.
Title XXXIII.
The cautery does not fall in Hydropsy, except properly.
When you treat Hydropsy with the methods of treatment we discussed in division, and if the treatment does not improve the condition, then it is necessary to cauterize it four times around the umbilicus using a single cautery, once over the stomach, another over the spleen, and one on top of the splenic area. Cauterizations should be performed twice along the back between the vertebrae, and one in the direction of the chest, and another directly over the stomach: and let the depth of each cauterization be about as thick as the skin.
Then release the open cautery, so that it discharges pus over an extended period of time.
And do not discharge the sick from treatment after the application of the cautery with it; for there should be two intentions that join him: and the healing will come to him with God's help.
However, the shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be like a key: according to its previous form. And for that one with which the back is cauterized, it should be circular according to its previous form.
§ On the method of cauterization for Feet and Legs. Head XXXIV.
When the urine becomes yellow and fills up in a hydroptic patient, it is necessary that you burn on the back of the foot at a spot known as 'noncratia', which is between the external ear (auricular) and the heel ('anulus'). And raise your hand with the cauterizing tool without twisting it. Then raise your hand again and don't touch the cauterizing instrument entirely.
Indeed, the yellow water will be there, and perform the cautery according to this manner.
Then, on each of the two legs, perform two cauterizations over the entire length of each leg. And carry out the cautery using the edge of the instrument as well. Perform the cautery according to the length of the leg; one under the knee and another below it, roughly midway down the leg. Over every hip joint, make two cauterizations. Release the open cautery without treatment for a long time so that some water might come out from it, then take care of this and the other points we have mentioned.
¶ Method of performing the cautery in the solution of the stomach. Head XXXV.
When the stomach solution is due to cold and moisture, until it weakens the retained and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines; then heal this with methods of healing, not letting it fully recover. And you will see a patient tolerating the burn of an excessive virtue. Then, perform the cautery on him using a large cauterizing tool over his stomach as what precedes in the stomach cautery with circular cauterizing tool and four thin cylindrical cauterizations around the umbilicus area, using a small triangular cauterizer beneath them: and then do a larger or two cauterizations above the pubis.
And if you see excessive moisture and a patient tolerating this, then perform the cautery over the ribs with a large cauterizer, and do it everywhere. Perhaps you might add two small cauterizations near the stomach for the big one.
For indeed, the remedy is efficacious, whose aid never fails.
On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Title 36.
When in the year there are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are from thick, cold, or damp fluids that have gone bad, and when they are treated as we said in division, and if the treatment does not succeed: then cauterize them with three applications of a cautery to the lower section of the spinal column below the ischium, in an area roughly triangularly shaped on either side. Then apply a cautery under the navel almost as wide as two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is cooled down, and the food he eats is not digested, and you see his face turn pale, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery as previously described: and apply a cautery over the spleen and another one over his appendix using a key-shaped cautery. And leave the open wound to heal at some point in time; afterwards, take care of him until he recovers.
On the method of cauterizing adenoids after their removal.
Title 37.
When you remove adenoids, then use the cautery that resembles a radius (or rod).
Then insert the ignited instrument into the removed adenoids: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the vessel from which blood is flowing; do this once, or twice. If therefore the adenoids are many, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Then take care of them using whatever aids from ointments that yield success, until they heal.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on the acanthus, it is more effective for recovery.
On the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Title 38.
When the patient does not respond to surgery and treatment as we have described in its proper place, and is frightened by it, perhaps healing may occur with cautery.
So when something like an anal fistula occurs, and it becomes infected, pus flows from it, and decaying moisture is discharged.
Therefore, what needs to be done is to probe it with a delicate instrument.
Then determine the depth of its extent using a probing instrument.
Next, apply the cautery which is similar to a rod.
Then insert yourself ignited into the fistula and determine the depth within which it has entered. And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all decaying substances are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the extent of your need.
And protect yourself from the irritation of nerves if they are there or large veins: or if the fistula reaches to the bladder body, or to the intestinal body, then protect yourself from all these places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fatty area: and you think that it is not penetrating deeply.
Then take care of the wound until it is fully healed.
If the wound is sealed and the material has been removed from it for a long time: then you will know that it has now healed completely.
And if the material does not come away from it, then you will know that it is penetrating, or its hole is deeply decayed, or as if this comes from there: whose recall will come to its proper place.
On the method of cauterization of the kidneys.
Title XXXIX.
When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or from thick winds, and it diminishes because of this ailment affecting the weaker one, then you should cauterize it on the inside on their own kidneys, with a cauterizing tool over all the kidney. The preparation for this must be recalled beforehand.
And perhaps we might cauterize it again on its own inside.
Therefore, three lines come about.
So they are more effective in improvement.
On the method of cauterization of the bladder.
Title XL. When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, until the sick person no longer retains urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the inside on the bladder, where hairs begin at the genital area, with a tool from the right side and another from the left side. The length of this cauterization should be similar to that of an inch. Cauterize it with a cauterizing tool under the back or with two cauterizations if necessary: and let it follow the cauterization done by the clavus tool beforehand.
On the method of cauterization of the uterus. Title XLI.
When coldness and moisture affect the womb, preventing it from being fertilized, her periods are disturbed, their arrival is delayed, and pain occurs at their approach, then it must be treated with three cauterizations around the belly button, as we explained in the cauterization of the bladder, and a cauterizing tool on the lower abdomen, or two cauterizations: and let this be done using the clavus tool.
On the method of cauterizing the elbow in dislocation.
Title XLII.
When the mucus moisture is poured onto the elbow joint, and becomes a cause of its exit from its place; and the sign of this is that when they are compared side by side, the shank extends over the other one. And the location of dislocation is found in it being vacuous.
Therefore, you must cauterize the weak part above the elbow joint with a similar circular cauterization: after marking it with an iron around the circumference of the elbow, just as it revolves; and let the ash fall in the middle of the circle.
And make the shape of the cautery precede in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, using a large oil-filled cautery. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the entire skin quantity.
Then take care of it until it heals.
On the method of cauterization for Sciatica. Title XLIII.
When pain occurs in the elbow joint and it is caused by coldness and moisture: and when the patient recovers with it as we said in division, but there's no improvement and it gets worse again. Then you need to relieve the patient of thick fluids with stinking pills or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Then cauterize him.
The method of the cautery for this is according to two methods: or a cautery with heating medicines, or a cautery with fire.
The cautery with fire is according to many ways.
One of these is to cauterize over the tip of the penis three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them depth good or bad.
And let there be space that is between every cautery, the size of a finger: and let it be the oil cautery.
But sometimes a cautery is made in the middle over the head of the penis itself.
Therefore, there are four cauteries.
And if you cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes the dislocation of the cautery in the process of making it, do so once: let there be a circle containing the whole penis.
And burn through the thickness of the skin completely.
This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the penis itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
But if it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize him with two cauteries over the hip, over the place where the sick person is bent, where there is pain, and your cautery on a pea four fingers wide towards the thigh: let it be the surgical knife cautery. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
If the sick person bends where the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize him there with a point cautery, three, or four, or more if it is necessary for him.
And if he bends the pain towards the leg under the knee, then cauterize him there with one surgical knife cautery.
And remember at every one of your cauteries that you do not finish with the cautery until it burns the nerve, or a large artery, and leave behind through this something harmful to the sick person, or a constriction.
And indeed I have seen one and another, among those who burned above the stone and completed their cauterization; then swelling occurred in the leg until it reached the foot, which was perforated entirely and corrupted completely: afterwards there is a wound of the abdomen, and death follows this.
If pain is in both parts at once, cauterize both according to this manner.
And some wise ones said about cauterization of the ankle, that this is the way to perform such an operation.
Make it similar to a nail from iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let its size at the place where it's located be according to the thickness of the middle part of a finger or slightly less. And inside this nail, there should be another smaller nail third in size.
And let the space that is between each nail be by quantity of the node of a thumb: and make nails open from both parts. And let their height be like a node or two nodes: and make for them handle made of iron that fits centrally into the nails.
And this is its form.
Then it is heated in the fire until it becomes red and expels sparks. Then place it on the ankle of the patient who is lying down on their healthy side under the affected foot.
Therefore, cauterize him with three round applications of heat one after another.
Then release the patient for three days.
Then dress the wound with butter: and leave the open wound to heal over many days.
Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis said, "With this type of heat application, we have used it sparingly due to the fear of its appearance. That's why there are few who dare to use it.
However, it is from among good cauteries that he who endures them and finds his place with them.
The cautery with those who endure medicines is such that you should make two samia having holes, a perforated bracelet, into which descends the hinge of his door from air, or iron, the length of the walls: whose heights there are two knots among them, or as they themselves.
And let there be a space which is between the two quantities of thickness of a finger, and let them open below and above: and let it contain each other according to this form.
Then place that on the stump of the thumb, which is weak lying over the healthy side.
And press your hand onto the stump of the thumb from above many times.
Then pour between two circles made from hot water which has been heated with a fire for a short while, and hold it to the time duration of an hour: and the weak will endure its gnawing and its drying, for he found its gnawing as fire until the gnawing ceases.
Then raise your hand with the tool and wipe off the hot water from the thumb completely along with sweet water: then release that for three days.
And put butter over it until the dried blackness is removed: and release that for several days, and pus will drain from it.
For it is the last stage in recovery.
And then care for that with ointment until it heals.
And if the pain extends to the hip or thigh, have him lie on what contains water as you did for the thumb equally.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it down in the book on the correction of medical practices.
Take alkali and the ashes from both not fully extinguished and mix them together. Clean each separately and put them in a new vessel; let its lower part be pierced with one small hole according to the quantity entering, it is as wide as your radius. Place another treated jar under the bottom of this vessel. Pour out the alkali and ashes into sweet water such that they are submerged by about an inch. Afterward press them with your hand until you get a good compression. Then let the vessel drain until the sharp water reaches the lower part of the treated vessel from below.
Then mix all that water together and pour it over another layer of lime; and keep cooking until it is renewed.
Indeed, it will then be of great sharpness, which is administered in many medical operations, and in cauterizing the rest of the members.
Because it produces the action of fire itself.
And in medicines where they are used for cauterization of the anca (a type of gland), even like tesse (an herbal resin) and melanocarpus (a type of berry), and calx with soap, such that both are well mixed together.
And Galen indeed recounted it in his descriptions from an old practice of healing, which he used to treat pain in the anca and sciatic veins: and he praised its effectiveness greatly.
And he said that no other treatment is needed, and that he was healed by a single means until it was reported; because perhaps he had gone into the baths when they were being prepared for treatment and came out already healed. And it is taken from the green seitaragi (a kind of herb): and if the green variety cannot be found, use the dried fresh one: it should be ground thoroughly with a little fat and applied to the area where there is pain, on the anca or thigh, or in the groin: it is then bound on and left for three hours or as long as the patient feels discomfort from its heat.
Then introduce him into the bath.
And when his body becomes moist, introduce him into the throne (possibly referring to a surgical table or stool).
For pain retreats and healing occurs.
And you will know that no one should use a cautery with these remedies unless after bodily evacuation.
And Dioscorides who said that when the urine-soaked dung of goats is used to cauterize a sciatic vein, it hardens for him; and this manner of cautery is performed.
A piece of wool is taken and soaked in old oil, and placed over the deep spot, which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and closer to the heel.
Then take dry dung from goats, and ignite it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and remove it until it is extinguished.
Then repeat this process.
So do not cease to perform that until the sensation reaches up to the ankle through the process of treatment, and let the pain rest.
This method of cautery is called the Goatskin Cautery.
### Section on the Cauterization of Back Pain.
Title: Chapter 44
Sometimes back pain occurs due to various causes, either by accident, impact, excess bodily evacuation and similar cases, through the infusion of cold and moist substances. Indeed, cautery does not occur except in this single species alone, which is formed from the infusion of a cold substance.
Therefore, after the bodily evacuation of the sick person with fetid pills and similar items, they should be applied over the back where pain occurs. Three lines are marked across the width of half the body, after which five or more cauterizations are made on every line using an iron point, according to the amount that comes out from the patient's tolerance under his strength: and a cautery puncture is then performed.
And if you have one, cauterize with three or four cauterizations, with an intermediate medial cauterization, according to this form.
On the method of cauterization for the initial phase of granulation tissue.
Head 45.
This affliction happens many times to infants of full age.
And the sign of its initial phase in children is this: when a constriction occurs in breathing upon elevation and movement on him, and you find in the last vertebra of the back and his nodes that it has begun to rise above the other vertebrae.
And when you see that and understand how to do it, then cauterize him with a ring-shaped cautery according to this method.
And take the cautery over all parts equally: and if you wish, cauterize around each vertebra with a puncture-shaped cautery of two lines or three: and let the points be close to each other.
Then take care of the area until it heals as we have said.
And be careful not to apply the cautery where the granulation tissue forms due to nerve spasm.
On the method of cauterization for gout and joint pains. Head 46.
When joint pains are due to cold humid substances, which flow into any part of the body, then whenever pains occur in the feet, according to medical practice, they call this condition properly Gout.
And when the cold-caused Gout is being treated with the methods of treatment and the pains are not disappearing, then the cautery removes them.
And it is that you should cauterize him after evacuation within the circumference of the feet' joining, with multiple cauterizations: and let there be an olive oil cauterization.
This is the form of it.
And if you need to make points on the face of the foot, then do so with point cauterization.
And if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints and this happens many times, then cauterize him over all the knees with three cauterizations or four from each side, using this same clavii (a type of iron instrument) for the cauterization. And if you need more of this cauterization, then cauterize him. And do not immerse your hand in the cauterization, but rather let its thickness be about the same as that of the skin.
And if the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said about the cauterization in its chapter.
And if pains are only in the hands, then make marks around the fingers, as two lines are outlined.
And if there remains from the pains in the fingers, then prick them, over every knuckle point, and over the hand's comb.
And if pains rise after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize each from all sides.
And do not evacuate the sick from good management, by reception of medicines.
For if good treatment is done and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God using this cauterization.
Section on the manner of cauterizing in Wounds.
Title XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or epididymis descends to the testicle, if this starts close by: then it is necessary that you quickly relieve the swelling on the day itself.
And he should use things that will cause mild irritation, so that the feces may be expelled from his own belly.
Then place him between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath until he exhales, or it appears that the epididymis or intestine is coming out.
Then reduce him with your fingers, and apply the branding iron under the rupture on the penis bone, using a brand whose tip is similar to the radius of a circle above the body.
Then apply the cautery iron, which has this shape, until the whites come out and it expels the pus.
Then reduce the intestine or epididymis back into its natural cavity.
Then place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from escaping: and you have already opened between his thighs, and placed a pillow underneath him, and someone else is supporting his thighs, and another is supporting his chest holding hands.
Then place the brand on him at the mark, with your hand holding the brand straight above him.
And hold him until you follow the mouth with him: or alternately with him turn side by side, if you have not followed him to the mouth starting from his first position.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your act of branding, so as not to burn him and let it pass over the patient causing death or great harm.
And you will know that when you do not follow with the brand to the mouth, your operation is not completed.
And it must be that a children's cautery be fine, according to their measure.
Then care with the rest of the ointments until it heals.
And let him lie ill on his own back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it must be that you give him his food according to the duration of his healing time, which soothes his stomach: so that it does not leak out at the point of entry and during digestion.
Then, when you wish to have him get up after forty days, then administer a ligament made in the center, and let him hold it for forty more days with others.
For when he uses this regimen, then he is healed with complete healing.
When Wounds occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and you want them not to add up, then cauterize his wound with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let that which burns be as three quarters of it.
Then care for it, with what we said about it: and do not let it increase.
And some have said about the first: that the Wound should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
After signing with the wax seal, and placing a line which is across the width at the upper side of the Wound, and another line downwards. And place your hand in the middle with the triangular cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Regarding the method of applying cautery for pains due to situation or impact.
Title XLVIII.
When it happens in certain limbs due to an accident or impact: and that pain persists for a long time, and no treatment is effective with the doctors: then it must be treated by applying the punctum cautery.
And the size of the cautery for any member should be according to its size and thickness, its weakness, its strength, the position it's in, whether it's twisted or not, and the pain it causes.
If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
But if not, then apply an additional cautery over it.
For according to the custom of these pains, they tend to migrate from one limb to another that is closest to them.
Therefore, you should follow the patient with the cautery until they are healed.
Regarding the method of applying cautery for Leprosy.
Title XLIX.
However, for leprosy, sometimes they benefit from an intense cautery.
And especially the type of leprosy that results from putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, consider the strength to apply when treating it.
If then the leprosy is growing and you have treated it as we said in the division, and it does not descend or remain stationary: and feel over the patient to see corruption spreading across their entire body: then apply the cautery on them over the head with five cauterizations: one in the middle of the head that is well-known, and the second lower towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, and two above two horns, and one behind the cervical vertebrae.
And finally, apply your hand with the cautery until it makes a tiny impression in the mouth and the slabs are dislodged from it. So that the emission of thick vapors from it may be alleviated, and also cauterize the spleen by applying the cautery to it again, as follows.
And after the Leprosy has spread over the sick person and becomes evident: then it is necessary to apply these cauterizing methods that we have described in the beginning and to cauterize above the tip of the nose, and with two cauterizations on both maxilla bones, and with two cauterizations on each cervical vertebra, and six on each lumbar vertebra, and one large one over the lower tail bone and one over it at the anus. And with two cauterizations over the hips: namely, one over all of the hip, and two over knees: one for each knee, and two over shoulders, and two over arms, and two over the underside of his chest: and cauterize this above every joint from the joints of his hand fingers and feet. And cauterize above the entire heel of his foot, and both of the palm bones of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the last heel bone, so as not to burn them. And sometimes it is cauterized by applying the cautery to the incisors, and another time to the stomach opening, and yet another to the esophagus.
And you should know that the more you apply of the cautery, the greater is its benefit and effectiveness.
And you should know that the sick person does not find pain from the cautery as they would with a healthy person; for their body is already numbed.
And it is necessary that the cauterizations are of size and quality according to body parts and joints: as prescribed by the types of instruments.
Head L.
When a certain member (part of the body) is in shock and after it has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but does not heal, then cauterize that shocked member with cauterizing substances according to its size or the degree of its decay.
And make your cautery penetrate deeply into the thickness of the skin evenly.
Then care for it with salve until it heals.
And sometimes cauterization is done for certain states of shock that occur to the hand and foot, at the spine's exit points of nerves that move that member. And the shock is relieved.
However, do not assume this for it, unless one is knowledgeable in anatomy of members and the exit pathways of moving nerves.
Regarding the method of cauterization in Albucasis.
Head 51.
When Albaras becomes old and nothing from the methods of medicine remains in it: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Then care for it with herb flour and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of the arnoglossae plant, and pigeon's blood, and rabbit's blood: use a portion of each. Mix all these together and spread them on cloth, applying to the area until healing occurs.
Regarding the method of cauterization for a cancerous condition.
Head Fifty-Two.
When cancer is beginning, and you have stood it up: then burn it with a circular cauterizer as it rotates.
The wise ones said that it should be burned by the last cauterizer in the middle.
But to me, that does not seem right; for I fear it will become infected: and I have seen that happen several times. And it is better to burn around it with a circle, as we said, or with multiple cauterizers. ### On the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Head Fifty-Three.
When someone has Adubelati and it matures slowly, or because of excess causing it, or due to the age of the weak, when they are decrepit with little blood, or because of time and the urge to hasten its maturation for Adubelati, then cauterize around it using multiple large puncturing cauterizers.
Then release her.
For it will hasten in its maturation.
If however you make a puncture of it with the cauterizer, then with fire burn the cauterizer, which has this form.
And place it in the center of the Adubelati until it penetrates the skin: and let the wound caused by that which follows be treated with clean runs.
Then care for it until it heals.
### On the method of cauterization in an eating away disease. Head Forty-Four.
An eating away is nothing but corruption in a walking member, and it eats at that thing: just as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see corroding (deterioration) at a site that can withstand cauterization with fire, then apply multiple burn treatments using small and large iron clamps, as per what is suitable for the particular location where the corrosion is occurring.
Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate all the corruption, and let nothing remain of it at all. Then release (the patient) for three days, and place on the cauterized areas powdered sulfur mixed with oil until all the scabs have fallen off, and all corruption has been eliminated.
Then care for the patient using ointments to promote flesh growth.
If, however, you observe that after three days the healthy flesh is growing as if it were born anew, and there is no corruption present, this is good.
And if not: then apply the cauterization again over that which remains from the sites of corruption.
And sometimes the corroding (deteriorating) is treated with an acute medicine.
Indeed, it rises from the site of the cauterization.
However, the application of fire during cauterization is quicker in healing: and indeed, I have already mentioned that it can be accompanied by an acute medicine in its administration. Therefore, take this method when you need it there.
¶ On the method of cauterization for clavus (a type of boil) and verruca (a wart). Chapter LV.
This kind of ailment often happens in the lower parts of feet; it is a large, filtered thing that harms the foot. And indeed, there are two ways to apply cauterization on them: cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
However, when the fire is such that it creates an iron cautery resembling a hollow pen, which is made by including the key from every part: and let there be fine edges.
Then place the burning thing on the key. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the key until the cautery reaches the depth of the key: and let it be for three days, until it begins to emit pus. Then cover it with a plaster of rue herbs, ground with salt, and apply the plaster to it at night. For he will be uprooted from his roots.
Then take care of the place with an ointment for generating flesh, until it heals.
If they do not heal and repeatedly occur on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet: then apply to them a cautery with warm water: and it happens that you take a tube from air, or iron, or from a bird's quill: and place it over the key, or althelul.
Then introduce a small amount of water from the warm into the tube: hold your hand and rotate it with the pressure of your hand just enough so that the edge of the tube touches the root of the key, and allows the warm water to find its way down to the depth, to the root of the key: and let the patient remain for a while on the wound from the hot water.
Then remove it, for the key will be uprooted along with its roots.
Do this one by one until you have treated all those that come from it within the body.
Then take care of them after they are uprooted, using what generates flesh from ointments.
On the manner of cauterization in Tremonia.
Head 56.
When it happens to someone Tremonia due to cold on a nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you burn him with four burns, or five over the spinous processes of the back, and between every spinous process with a burn, and in his chest with a burn, and over his stomach with a burn.
For Tremonia stops when burned with oil and the health of cold sickness advances. On the method of cauterization for Albathir.
Head 57.
At times, within the body of an Albathir, evils are expelled, that is, pus blisters which come from corrupted matters.
Therefore, it should be done firstly when they appear, that each head of the pus blister be burned with a fine cauterizer dipped in myrtle wood which has been lit by fire.
Or with the long root of Aristolochia.
Or with a lens-shaped cauterizer. And sometimes they are burned at the anus, at the beginning of their expulsion according to this manner: and they do not increase: and a surplus is broken causing them to be cured from it.
However, this must happen after evacuation with bloodletting.
On the manner of cauterization during blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Head 58. Many times there is blood flow from an artery which has been cut at the wound, that happens externally, or at the cut made by lancet, or similar things to them: and it becomes difficult to remove it.
When such a thing happens to someone, then promptly approach with your hand towards the opening of the artery and place your index finger on it: and squeeze it much until the blood is confined under your finger and does not escape from it. Then place a small olive oil cauterizing iron into the fire, and heat it to a high temperature: and blow upon it until it becomes well lit.
Then take one or two, little or large, according to the size of the wound and the place where the artery has been severed, and place the cauterizing iron upon that vein, after which you remove your finger promptly: and hold the cauterizing iron until the blood is withdrawn.
If the blood is expelled when you raise your finger from the opening of the artery and you extinguish the cauterizing iron, then take another cauterizing iron promptly, from those that are prepared in the fire. So do not stop doing this with one after another until the blood is withdrawn.
And be careful, do not burn the nerves which are there, and let some other mischief happen to the weak due to it. And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is impossible to withdraw it: especially when the artery is large, unless with one or four measures.
Or with a cauterizing iron, as we have said.
Or through extraction, when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract and the blood is withdrawn.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract and the blood is withdrawn. Or it can be tied with a thread using strong ligature.
Or apply medicines of their nature which cause blood withdrawal and bind with an appropriate constriction using a pulley.
Those who perform amputation with ligature and bandage compression, or the arrangement of burning things and similar ones, do not completely remove them, except occasionally.
If however, this happens to someone and there is no present doctor nor medicine, then he should start by placing the position of the index finger over the opening of his own vein, as we have described, and with extreme constriction until the blood is bound from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
And the finger is not removed; instead, it remains with cold water from above constantly until cooled down, until the blood congeals and thickens, and then it should be cut. And meanwhile, he should consider what is needed from cautery or from medicine.
¶ The End of the First Part.
Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part II. ¶ On Incisions, Perforations, and Venous Bleeding in Wounds, and Similar Conditions.
We have spoken about it in the first chapter, all illness where it is appropriate to use fire and burning medicine together, its causes, occasions, its tools, and forms of cautery. And I placed the headings from head to foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that it may be helpful to him who seeks what is sought. And before I begin this, you should learn from children or sons what is to be found here in this chapter on fear which was mentioned in the first chapter about cautery.
And because of this, there should be greater caution in it, since in the operation described in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs with blood, which is a sign of life at the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening at the exit wound, or treatment for wounds, or extraction of arrows, or incision over a stone, and similar cases: from all these there comes trembling and fear, and death falls upon many of them.
And I warn you, do not fall into the thing that is hesitated upon, for sometimes such matters of men come to you in this art with their illnesses.
For there are those who become angry with their illness, and death is gentle to him; due to the intensity of what he discovers from his illness and the length of his malice.
And when illness arises from fear which signifies death.
And from these, there are those who give you their kindness and enriches you with it, hoping for healing, and his illness is harmful. Therefore, it is not necessary to agree with him who comes to you from these, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your insatiable desire.
And do not presume about anything from him, unless after certain knowledge which verifies that admirable succession to what it has come about with you.
And use it in the care of all your patients, prediction and indication for what would suitably bring health.
And in that there is assistance for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, my children, his understanding, and not remove your guidance and inspiration from you, for that is within his power.
And indeed, I have organized this chapter by dividing it into sections, following the order in Chapter 'The use of the cautery', from neck to feet: so that you may find what you are seeking from it and what you need.
¶ On the treatment of water which is gathered in children's heads.
Head I.
Know that this illness often happens to infants during childbirth: or when the midwife is gripping the head of the infant without lifting it.
And sometimes it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
And indeed, I have not seen this illness in others as in infants: and death has approached every one of them from that. Therefore, it seems to me fitting for me to refrain from performing operations in such cases.
And indeed I have seen an infant among them whose head was filled with water and the size of its head increased every day until it could no longer sit on itself due to the size of its own head: and the moisture increased until death occurred.
And this moisture indeed either accumulates between the skin and the mouth or accumulates under the bone above the jaw.
And if the operation is to be performed, and there's moisture between the skin and the mouth and the abscess is small, then you should make a cut in the middle of the head with a width: and let the length of the cut be like two nodes until the moisture passes.
And this is the form of the spatula.
If however the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then place these two cuts according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone and its sign is that you see openings of the skull from every part: and water is pressed down when you press it with your hand to the interior, and whatever does not hide itself from you: then you should make three cuts in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
And after making the incision, remove all the moisture.
Then cleanse that from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then release the bandage, and take care of the wound with lint and ointments.
And do not relax the binding on the head to an equal degree.
And feed the sick with all dry food that has little moisture, until the member is comforted and healed.
And another measure for an incision is to assess where the size of the boil becomes visible and the collection of pus.
For sometimes there is more in the back of the head, or at the top of the head, or on the right side, or on the left.
Therefore, ascend with your incision wherever you see the boil and accumulation of pus: and divide that according to what is possible for you.
And observe to not cut the artery and let blood flow out, and have the sick die from that flow with the loss of moisture.
Section on incisions of arteries which are behind the ears.
Head II.
When such a thing happens to someone with a cough reaching the eyes, or to the chest, and it becomes chronic, not treating it with medical means is more. Then, the last resort treatment for that is through the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, the sick person must shave their head.
Then rub the area with coarse cloth until the arteries become visible.
Then, the sick person should bind their neck with any of their own cloth.
Then consider where the pulse lies.
And the places of both are those that are depressed behind the ears: and it rarely disappears, unless in some people.
Then apply signs with the hot wax on both sides; and cut both using the sharp lancets until you reach the mouth: and this should be done across the width of the head.
And if possible, insert the lancet under the artery and cut it upwards with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be about as long as two joined fingers.
For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with the pulsation flow which jumps into the organs with frequent leaps.
If however the artery is not apparent to touch, then it must be measured from the ear by an extent of space equal to three fingers.
Then apply signs with hot wax and cut until you reach the mouth.
And what needs to be emitted from the blood is six uncia and perhaps you might emit more or less from it. Do the entire operation according to the quantity that you perceive from the patient's illness and the filling of his artery.
Then consider it applied to the wound.
Then if anything remains near the mouth from it, then cut that part in order to avoid a hot boil: then bind the wound with linen thread.
And then care for it with ointment until it heals.
### Section on the Removal of Arteries, Which Are in the Joints
Chapter III.
When it happens to a person with an old half-headache, or acute colds due to acidic humidities and warmth in the joints of the limbs, or old soda and similar things: and he is treated with the methods of medical treatment, and does not match that; then we are familiar with these illnesses involving the extraction of arteries from the joints, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
And concerning the manner of operation in their removal, it is that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the flaps and aims at the visible artery in the flap.
For she is shown to you by her own pulse and rarely is hidden except in a few people or cases of coldness.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient should tie their head with any piece of cloth: afterwards rub the area with a rough cloth.
Or wet the spot with hot water until you see it clearly manifestly. Then take the spatula, which I shaped before. And then scrape off the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
And then push in a hook into it and pull it upwards until you remove it from the skin, making sure to allow it to come out from all sides of the garments that are beneath it.
If however, the artery is delicate, then wrap it with the tip of the hook.
Then cut from that part according to the length of its ends which stretch and are shortened, so that there is no flow of blood.
For if it is not cut or removed completely, the blood does not rise fully. Then evacuate the blood from six uncia (approximately 20ml) up to three uncia (approximately 10ml).
And if the artery is large, then you should tie it in two places with a strong double thread of silk or alcohol strings so that it does not extend towards the same before the healing of wounds, and there may be no flow of blood.
Then cut off the excess which is between the two ligaments.
Perform that operation at that hour, or another hour afterwards. And if it is a vein, cauterize it with a cauterizing tool until you reach the opening, using a surgical knife. Continue until its ends are reached and the site of the operation remains stable.
It is better if the sick person has a fever, or their complexion becomes hot.
Because cauterization is from those things which assist in stopping moisture.
Therefore, it is better for assistance.
And after the arteries have been extracted, it is necessary to fill the cavity with old cloth: and they should place over it central-woven reeds.
And after the wound has been cleaned, it is treated with dry medicines that promote flesh growth, and with herbs, until it heals.
If during the operation a blood flow occurs from an artery, then quickly cut it with a cautery or fill the place with wax until the blood stops. Hold your hand tightly until the blood is stopped.
If nothing of those things is available to you, then place your finger on the site until the blood coagulates.
And immerse the site with boiling water until the pain subsides and tighten according to what is needed.
And because it is lighter and easier to extract an artery, it is done by cauterizing a vein with this type of cautery that has two knives: let the sharpness of the two knives be like that of amalgam.
However, it is much less sharp than two knives.
Because if they are as sharp as two knives, each causes coldness to spread: and it does not cut the flesh at speed.
When therefore there is a certain amount of thickness in them, heat of the fire is held in them, and flesh is cut off quickly; thus this makes every operation better, lighter, and easier.
And let there be a space that is between the two knives a breadth of a finger, after you mark two places with a hot iron: and remove both the heated ends thoroughly until they reach the mouth and penetrate in two places. So as to extend what is between its extremities.
For this cautery does not harden completely.
And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ On the care for frequent, continuous watering eye discharges from the eyes.
Title IV.
When there are frequent tears, and you see a flow of them from the eyes which are above the head, outside on the skull: and there is no need for any medical treatment among medicines in this case; and you observe the patient's face already turning red, and he feels a wandering sensation on his forehead, just like when ants wander: and his eyes are weakened, wet, to the point that even the hair follicles have corroded with the tears. And his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears; then the old men resorted to this treatment in their care for them, and named it after 'En', referring to a specific procedure or method used historically for such conditions.
And it is that you should shave off the hairs which are on his forehead.
Then make three cuts on the forehead that are equidistant according to the length of the forehead. And let the length of each cut be about two fingers long. The first cut should be equidistant from the nose's length at the middle of the forehead, and the second one is along the length following where tears flow, slightly more than halfway down. The third cut goes across from the other side. Be cautious not to cut through arteries that are on both sides of your incision area. Extend your hand from the continuation of both cheeks, and make all incisions have a total width equivalent to about three fingers joined together. Prepare a piece of sponge or dry pieces of cloth for you, with which to soak out blood.
Then insert the spatula of the two sharp extremities, whose following form is.
From the incision which is on the part of the tympanum, up to the second incision: and scrape with it the entire skin, which is between the two incisions, together with the siphon, which is above the mouth. Then do this also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then remove this spatula, and insert another tool again, which is called the sharp surgical knife, gently from one side, not sharply from the other.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh joined with skin, and its flat side gently towards the mouth: and push it until it reaches the middle cut: and remove with it all the fat which descends from the head to the eyes: except that continues in the cut up to what is visible through the skin.
Then do this until you reach the other cut (opening) in the middle cut.
And after the flow of blood is equal to that quantity, press out the places from the clots of blood on the surface. Then place linseed oil from old cooked material throughout every cut, and place on them powders soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
And see to it that no boil appear hot.
And on the third day, untie the bandage, and administer plenty of water-based infusion.
Then care for it with balsam and other remedies used for wounds until it is healed.
Section: Care of sharp tears and mucous discharges to the eyes from within the head.
Head V.
When a sudden cough occurs to someone, treat them continuously and regularly. Examine their eyes which may have become exhausted, reddened, or already weakened in appearance: and find that the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall from them; also there's an intense pain deep within the head, causing it to be hurt by and following sneezing: then consider these symptoms; unless they come about due to many veins, neither cough nor mucus would arise otherwise.
And the better treatment for them is this.
And it is that you advise the sick person to shave their forehead.
Then make an incision in the head, one in the middle of the forehead or slightly off-center along its width. Start your cut from the left side moving towards the right side and continue it until you reach the mouth: extend your hand away from the movable temporal bones which move during chewing. Continue the cut until the mouth is fully exposed. Then, with a sponge, dry all the blood completely.
Then separate between the two incision flaps with a surgical instrument like an ointment scoop or with thread made of linen.
Then apply the poultice from above using grains of it: and soak the grains with wine and oil so that no heat blister occurs.
And when you release that, and see that the heat blister is now diminishing: then it must be that you rub the mouth until flesh begins to form within it.
Then take care of it with an evaporation regimen that makes flesh develop: like if you take two parts from wheat flour and four parts of colophony (a type of resin): prepare this mixture as a plaster and apply it for the development of flesh in these wounds until flesh begins to form.
On the care for what falls into the Ear. Title VI. Every object that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: it could be a mineral stone, like iron or tin; it could resemble a stone, such as being made of plant material, like chickpeas and beans; it might be some kind of flexible substance, like water, vinegar, and similar things; or it could be some kind of animal.
So when a stone (or a similar object) falls into the ear, you should expose the ear to the sun. If you then see the stone, distill something from castor oil or flaxseed in the ear.
Then perform the extraction of it and make him sneeze while he is being rubbed, and pinch his nostrils at the onset of sneezing. After that, place some shredded cloth or wool around the edge of the ear, and then spread the ear towards the top.
Indeed, this treatment is performed many times.
If however it doesn't come out, then perform the extraction with Gesti, that is, with fine pizzigarioli needles: its shape is as follows.
So if it comes out with gesticulation, it is good.
And if not, then perform the extraction using a blind, fine, somewhat double-bladed tool (uncino caeco). So if it doesn't come out through that, then make a tube from air, and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening very much, and force inside what is in the circumference of the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no wind other than the tube: then pull it out with your strong suction. Indeed, this method often works as we have described.
If this method does not work either: then take from the helkali bag or from the shark's stomach, that is, a small amount of the substance used to catch birds. Place this inside at the end of the radius after you have centered it on the tympanic membrane when placed inwards towards the ear canal: afterwards insert this into the ear opening with ease after removing the wax from moisture.
If therefore it does not work with all that we have narrated, then hasten to cut before a hot pus blister occurs or a cramp.
And the method for cutting is as follows: first apply it to the weak one in the cephalic region: and remove him from his blood according to the strength of its effect.
Next have the patient sit between your hands and turn their ear upwards. Make a small incision at the base of the ear in the fatty area below its depression, and let it be shaped like a crescent until you reach the stone: then remove it along with what is possible for you using the tools that are at hand.
Then heal the cut from your own time with speed and care until it is healed.
If the matter falling into the ear has increased from one grain and swells up, then administer its removal.
If however it does not respond to you for an outcome, then take the spasmile which is slight and of this form.
And administer it with that from the grains which fall into the ear, and do not make this assumption when you think that that grain has already become moistened through the vapor of the ear until you place it as much in fragments: afterwards remove them with hooks, or with a subtle tool, or by suction as we said, for its extraction will be facilitated.
In the water that enters the ear, the patient must use a cough with condensation first: and now fills his ear with some warm water: and he is lying on that ear, in which there is water.
If therefore it comes out through that [method], it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin and soft, heat them with fire moderately, and let the patient insert one of these into his ear opening: and lets sprinkle water from that part on his foot, and hits it with another stone over the stone which is in the ear.
So do not stop doing this procedure with stones until all of the water has come out.
And now water comes out like this, that you take one from the reed or from a straw and insert one of its ends into the ear. And you ignite the other end with fire until it burns much of it.
Then take another reed and do this many times until all of the water has come out. And remove it together with the tube as indicated in the stone procedure.
During the removal of the animal entering it, if it is a small body, like a flea and similar to it, take care of it as I said in the division.
But if it is a large body that appears by sense: then administer the removal of its extraction with gestures and hooks: and its release is easier than all those which are held in the ear.
During the removal of worms hatched in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your care does not match: then you should inspect the ear in sunlight.
If something appears there from the worms, then extract that with forceps or with fine hooks.
If however nothing is seen there, then take a cannula, which has this form, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top: and insert its subtle end into the ear according to what the diseased person can bear. Then suck with that strong suction.
Do this many times until all the worms have come out.
If however they do not obey you for an exit, then fill the circumference of the cannula with oil, as I said about the stone.
If they do not come out with what we said: then administer the distillations that the ancients were familiar with for the infection of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring be of the oil and medicines you apply to the ear with this tool, as its form is depicted here.
As you see, make it of silver or tin, with the lower part being narrow and containing small holes, but wider at the top.
So it should be that which pushes inside in the hollow of the cannula is made from tin and is centrally formed.
And if you wish, take a reed and wrap its tip in the appropriate winding. Then produce oil, or juice, or whatever you want from these medicines into the cannula, and let it be inside the ear. Then insert the reed with its wrapper above, pressing it gently until the oil is pushed into the auditory cavity, which should be felt internally by the patient. And that substance poured into the ear should already have been warmed evenly by fire. Be careful not to use substances that are distilled and very cold; medicines do not tolerate this.
On the care for complications arising from ear operations.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs without being punctured.
And it happens to some individuals where the operation in the ear through a wound, or flesh born within it, leads to complications.
This operation sometimes happens deep within the ear's passage which does not follow the user's path; and at other times it occurs slightly towards the outer part of the passage and follows that user.
Therefore, what happens deep within the ear, and which cannot be comprehended by the eye, is in many positions difficult to heal.
And for the operation which follows the user, you need to place the ear of the sick in sunlight and observe it. Then, if you see an apparent operation, open it with a thin spatula tool, whose shape is as follows; its tip has a small width, where part of it is sharp: and the rest of the spatula should be between two soft sides so that it doesn't hurt the ear.
If the operation is from flesh born within the ear passage: then hold it with a thin hook and cut it with force until all the flesh is removed.
If the operation is deep within the ear: then take a thin, soft needle, heat it slightly with fire, and then insert it into the ear passage.
If you sense the operation with what the patient finds when they have a heavy hearing, try to open it gently: and beware, do not pierce the ear nerves.
Then place in the ear according to the size of the passage you have enclosed in the Egyptian ointment, do this for several days until you are sure about the healing of the wounds.
Take the licorice, and pour it into rose-colored water, then grind over it powdered zedoary, and use it.
If you see the pustule has already erupted: then you must take the licorice and allow it to be mixed with another substance that will be introduced into the caeroto which should have been made with rose oil until the pustule cools down. Then, attend to it until it is fully healed.
If however, a flow of blood occurs: then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the rest of the treatment which stops blood flow as described in the chapter on distillations.
Section: On the treatment of Eyelid (Altheli) Wounds.
Chapter VIII. These Altheli (wounds) that occur on the eyelids of the eye, sometimes they become moist and then dry out.
Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or a hook and puncture them from their roots with the lancets.
Then place powdered zedoary on the affected areas.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cauterizing instrument.
And the cauterization should be done better after the incision.
Many times they recur when there is something left from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not recur.
Section: On the treatment of Eyelid Granulomas (Grandinum) of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs in the eyelids that resembles the Crandini in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is named Grando: it is an aggregation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid, and also on the lower eyelid.
Therefore the operation is this: when you then inspect it, if there is a Grando proceeding from it visible on the eyelid and moving to every part of it, and its nature is easy.
Therefore find a cut across it across its width.
Then remove it from all sides with ease until it is gone.
Then hang it with a hook, and cut it off.
If it is not cut for you without bleeding at all until after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision, then that weak thing can harm in some way.
If the cut is large: then bind that with stitches: and take care of it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come from it to you.
For the ointment restores it and toughens it up.
And if Grando is descending towards the inner ear and against the inner surface, then turn the eyelid and hang the mass with a hook. Apart from that you need an incision, and press it from all sides.
And if the eyelid is lengthened through an incision, that does no harm to anything.
Then wash the eye after the incision with vinegar water: and take care of the area with whatever toughens it up until the patient is healed.
¶ Concerning the care of eyelashes.
Head X.
The end is sebum which is generated in the upper eyelid tunics: and this happens quite often to children: and it grates on their eyes, and they have watering in the mornings, and they cannot see the sun's light because tears come near them, therefore you see them lying down on their faces always, and sleep on them, and their eyelids are wet under their eyebrows, which has been filled by puffiness: and the Axirnath appears quite clearly to the eye, and when you press that place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And the method of its treatment is such that the patient places his head on your breast.
Then take flaxen cloth and prepare a paste of nitre in it. Make a circular patch from this paste with an area equal to that containing Axirnath from all sides.
Then place it on her, and press it with your fingers all around, so that Axirnath is collected in the middle of the circle.
Then find the center of that wet area with an incision through the mucus, making the incision across its width, and not a larger incision like those made in bloodletting at their deepest point.
Or you should find the entire skin until you reach Axirnath. For Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the shape of a small white fatty lump in various placements.
So remove it with the cloth you had soaked between your fingers up to the outside. And move your hand to the right and left until everything is spread out: and be careful not to add anything into the incision so that you do not end up putting mucus on the eye, which would harm it.
If indeed you do not see Axirnath at the beginning of the wound opening, then you should apply a little with ease to the wound opening until Axirnath proceeds.
Then extract her, as we have said.
Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the affected area, and bind it with powders.
And among humans there are those who grind salt and place it in the concavity of the wound, so that what remains from that moisture will dissolve.
Then take care of that until it heals.
If however an abscess occurs in the hot place, then take care of it with calming plasters until it heals.
Section on methods of treating Ataxmir for the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft, causing it to rub like it shouldn't.
Chapter 11.
When hair grows on the eyelids beyond the usual growth of natural hairs and becomes long: they then harm the eye and cause many discomforts such as frequent tears, softening of the eyelids, and puffiness, until this reason for the destruction of the eye occurs.
And indeed, treatment for Ataxmir of the eye follows four methods. Or through cautery with fire.
Or with an acute medicine, as provided in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is treated by making an incision and缝合 it.
Or through canals, as I shall say.
It is necessary that you place the sick head on your breast.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good.
And if not, introduce the point into it, where is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the point go through with the thread above, and let that be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs are born: and pull the thread up together with the eyelid and its radius, and turn it upwards.
Then find within the part of the eyelid under the added hairs, until you reach with spatula from the larger lacrimal to the smaller.
Then extract the thread, and place under the eyelid a small cotton ball or cloth. Then mark above the eyelid with the branding iron, so that it looks like a figure of a myrtle leaf.
However, it must happen that the figure is according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for this already varies among humans.
For there are those who need that the amount by which it hits from the eyelid is large, according to the amount which softens from the eyelid. Then, with the spatula, find above the two lines you marked, and start from the larger lacrimal to the smaller one, and let there be a single tear-like opening close to the natural hairs, as is the thickness of the radius.
Then introduce the hook into one of the two corners of the skin. Then scrape off the whole thing. Then, with needle and fine wool thread, stitch together the two lips using a sharp tool: and clean off any blood, and ensure that what is extraneous from the threads covering the two eyebrows stays there if you want to do it this way; and if not, don't bother.
Then remove the suture and thread up to three days, or four: afterwards take care of that. And if there is a wound, remove it without suture, and take care of it, which dries and tightens.
The eyelid is raised at the seal wound and its gathering: but the future is better.
This method of treatment for Ataxmir was taught by the ancients.
But indeed concern over the sick person is there, and it comes from good treatment, and not within it is fear.
And another method is used for Ataxmir as well: and it is that you draw signs over the eyelid to form a figure which looks like the shape of a leaf of laurel, just as we have described.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate or grouped crescents, according to this shape that follows, then cut what remains hanging with the outer edges of the blades, according to this shape, with equal incisions.
But if it is not possible for you to hold the crescent and it does not match that: then take one with a thread in which you will insert it in the middle of the figure. And insert another thread near the tear duct on the larger side, and another thread near the tear duct on the smaller side. Then group together the threads between your fingers with equal spacing.
Then raise your hand at an equal elevation: and lift the skin upon which there is marked out the fold as we have described.
Then gather together the two lips with a suture over the wound: and take care of it until it heals.
But if indeed an abscess should occur at your incision or crack: then remove that abscess with a piece of wadding, and do so similarly using ointments for soothing.
And it sometimes happens that even eyelashes can turn into their hair.
¶ On the care of Ataxmir with dogs.
And it is to convert the eyelid and divide the fissure which is above, according to what I have described.
Then make two canna (a type of instrument used for suturing) or two slender sticks. The length of these should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of the suture thread. And you have already incised at both ends where you hold the thread from each side.
Then gather both with the slightness above that which protrudes from the eyelid, and bind two canna (medical instruments) tightly around each side of the suture, exerting a firm tension, and let them off for several days. The skin, when tightened, will die, darken, and decompose until it falls off on its own.
If therefore the healing is delayed, then cut it with forceps.
Then care for it until it heals.
When it is consolidated, lift the eyelid: and do not allow the hair to poke through.
And this is how the two canna (medical instruments) should be made, as per this figure, and their size according to length and width.
¶ On the removal of irritating hairs in the eye with an incision.
Chapter XII.
The procedure is to take a fine needle and gently introduce a fine silk thread into it. Then unite its extremities and bind both knots with a very fine thread: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then compose another fine thread in Alinxotati beneath it for a short distance, and bind the ends if you wish.
Then the sick person should place their head in your bosom, and have it near the sun to show the operation: for the operation is subtle or minute.
Then introduce the point with Alinxotatis into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid as quickly as possible until you remove the natural hair above.
Then pull the hair up above Alinxotatis: and introduce that hair into Alinxotatis: if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out through the eyelid with the natural hair.
If however Alinxotatis is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull Alinxotatis downwards, with the thread you composed in it, until Alinxotatis exits through the hole above, and observe it visually: then pull Alinxotatis and the string: and extract both of them, and close the eye: and let him rest with the eye closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and grows over it flesh.
Now if the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from natural hairs, and raise it with it: or let him go until he stretches after some space, and then raise him.
¶ Regarding the care of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter 13.
When this happens in the eye according to Alxatrati, it is named Leporina.
And this according to Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Therefore, the accidental one occurs from the healing of wounds, or from sections, or from cauterizations, and similar procedures.
And the method of performing this is, to find that healing process, and to separate its edges, and to place within it something from linen that is between them, and to bind it until it heals.
And it is not necessary to use things that dry and tighten during its treatment; for if you do this, Alxatrati says that the outcome will be worse than before. Rather, use things that soften, like Greek fennel: mix them with water in which poppy seeds have been boiled, linen seeds: and ointment made from some of the oils: and wrap it with something between these two, and take care of it with it.
And your treasury of treatment is to use all your ingenuity so that it does not harden, according to its original shape.
Indeed, the operation we have described is merely a correction according to Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return completely as it was. ¶ The care according to Alxatrati that occurs in the lower eyelid, and it is a wrinkle or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This, according to Alxatrati which occurs below, is truly what Alxatrati names.
And it is both natural and accidental.
And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a crack, or cauterization, and similar procedures.
And concerning the operation for this, you should take one with two threads and insert it into the flesh, making it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Next extend the flesh upwards with the tip, and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If therefore the returned shape of the eyelid is as it should be, it is good.
And if not, take a thread and place it in the slit, then turn the eyelid with it. Create two slits on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of these slits be from both corners of the incision until they meet and form an angle: until they join, this forms the shape of them, and it is the Greek letter 'lauda'.
Then remove that flesh in the amount which corresponds to its narrow lower edge, starting from where it follows the eyelid.
Next, join the separated parts together: sew them with wool thread.
Then take care of them with what we have said about softening medicines and ointments until they heal.
And if Alxatrati should occur from the slit or suture, or with cautery: then it is necessary to create a flat slit under the eyelashes hairline, even if it follows beforehand.
Then separate the two lips with an ointment as we have said.
And the main point regarding caring for Alxatrati is that it should be treated in that operation according to how preparation from the shape of Alxatrati has been made.
For it is indeed a multitude of diversities in its shape: and the prudent artisan prepares his skill with whatever manner is possible for him, until he returns to the form that is natural or close to it. And the sick person himself adjusts according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter XV.
At times this condition occurs in many people, such that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the end of the rod under the eyelid and lift it upwards: or extend it with a hook. Then strike the adhesion with a small sharp blade, so that it not be against the sharpness of the incision of the blades, rather it should be blunt slightly. So that the patient is not disturbed during surgery, and removes the blade, and injures the eye with its sharpness: and your cut as if you were scraping away this adhesion as easily until when returns the eyelid according to its natural form, and heals completely the adhesion.
Then pour salty water into the eye and wash it out with that water: or distill it onto it from the product made, from zinc dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linseed blade: and place over the eye wool soaked in the white of the eye. And on the third day use the product, and with the hardened ones, until it is healed.
¶ On the incision of the nail and prominence of the tear-producing tissue.
Chapter XVI.
You know that the nail is according to two manners. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to a hard saw, thin.
Or it is not nervous, similar to the consistency of water that has frozen and turned white; which when touched by a metal tool or tried to grasp it with a hook, it can be cut off and the hook does not get stuck in it.
And neither of these types begin unless from the greater lacrimal gland, until it proceeds gradually, until it accomplishes its purpose, and obstructs the passage, and stops the movement of the eye.
And the method for performing an incision is as follows: let the sick place his head on your bosom.
Then open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Then gather the nail with a small double fold clipper, and extend it towards the top.
Then take the tip, and insert it into a hair from horses', cows, or goats: and make sure it's strong and thickly twine its extremity around the edge of the nail halfway, fix it in the middle of the nail: then pierce it with the tip and tie it to the nail with thread. Extend that towards the top: and scrape off the side of the nail that follows the pupil as if you were holding it together with hair all the way up to its root.
Then make the remaining cut in the root of the lacrimal gland with a thin spatula or with clamps: and remove the natural tissue of the lacrimal gland so that there is no continuous flow of tears from his incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with just a single clipper: or with thread, as we said.
Then scrape it off with a soft spatula, which has this shape.
And beware, lest the spatula touch the cornea's skin, and cause damage or perforation of the pupil.
Then after the cut, pour some powdered salt or sifted zinnia into the eye and let it out until another day.
Then care for it along with what needs to be done, until it is healed. If the hoof is not horny and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor can you implant a hook within it, then this type of hoof should be treated repeatedly with medicines. It will heal as I have described in the section.
If you intend to penetrate it, then open the eye of the diseased one, and take a delicate spatula, gently and weakly sharp, according to this shape.
And shave the hoof from above with reason and subtlety.
If you see that it is becoming rarefied and collapsing, and if reason impresses itself into her, then distill from your hour into the eye from a sieve made of zinc, or from a red sieve, or ground salt: and fill the eye until another day.
Then iterate over this operation until everything of it is removed.
Unless there appears to you in the eye a warm blister: then indeed remove her, and care for the blister until it is healed. Then iterate the operation over her with reason until she is healed.
The prominence of the eyelid tissue, if it causes damage in the eye that is significant, should be suspended with a hook and cut from its part. Do not make the final incision so as to avoid any flow of tears.
Then distill from a red sieve or made of zinc in the tear duct until it is healed. ¶ Concerning the operation on Alguardenic and the tissue that is born in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes in certain people's eyes, a red tissue is born or overlaid until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids and may even turn the eyelids outward. It is likened to a small rose of red color.
And there is an operation for that too, so that the sick person may place his head on your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and gather that whole piece of flesh together with the appropriate hooks for this task: and hold that with one pair of forceps, or by handling it.
Then cut the flesh from the beginning until you finish it all with the help of the incisors.
And be careful not to harm the eye during surgery: and make your cut where you are about to cut it, or use small spatulas, as we described in the cutting of claws: or use large forceps with which the seabeel is collected, according to how its form will come after this head.
And when your cut is complete and the entire augeare has been removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye of the outside an ointment cloth with wool: so that it may be protected from hot steam.
If any remains from the augeare and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess, then take out the eye and care for it with what stops an abscess.
Then apply it to the affected area during surgery until it heals.
And similarly do so with flesh that may occur in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that the care of any weak eye from one's own natural or accidental cause should be performed with iron when operating: and do not interfere with your hand in any of these operations until you realize that this member is enduring that operation.
¶ On the removal of the seabeel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. The disease is of red spots that cover the eye, and hinder its own action: and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore, you must first consider whether the eye in which Sebel is present is strong and there is no other illness in it besides Sebel: then collect Sebel from its (the eye's) (location or context).
And you should do this to the sick person, that he places his head in your bosom.
Then suspend those reds with one hook or two according to your judgement: and let the hook be fine of duplication, as per this form, or let there be two hooks graduated within one body, as per this form.
Then collect with fine forceps those reds with fineness, and cleanse the blood hour after hour, until you see those reds being removed from the eye, and dissolve: and beware not to harm the eye with the cutting instruments.
And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation greatly: so that you do not fall upon other reds unless they are those ones.
And when you have completed, then distil into the eye a green or red sieve: so that its sharpness may polish what remains from Sebel.
If however it is not possible for you to collect all of that in that hour, then smear the eye with what soothes the eye's pain: and let it rest a few days until its pain subsides: and it should be protected from hot wind: then repeat it according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps.
On the Reduction of Arissati to the Nose.
Head 19.
Doctors name the condition 'Arissati Fistula', which they treat with cautery or with a burning topical medicine, as per what has been previously mentioned in their account.
And if it is not cured, then there is no skill in that matter: unless you mark out the site of the blister at birth and remove all the moisture contained therein along with pus until the mouth is revealed.
And when the mouth is revealed and you see corruption or blackness within it, then cut it out with an instrument whose shape is like this.
And they are called Rough Headings.
Make it out of iron and have its head round like an azir, let it be perforated with the tip of a file or a finely sharpened point made from alum knive steel: place it upon the corrupted part of the bone. Then roll it between your fingers and press your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been removed. And do this several times.
Then roll it between your fingers and press your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been removed. And do this several times. Then restore the site with drying,收敛 and cauterizing medicines.
If therefore the site has consolidated and flesh is formed within it, and after this healing process, if the process of cutting off ceases: then continue for forty days, should there be no recurrence, nor blistering nor occurrence in that place, then you will know that it has been healed.
And if not, then there is no skill within it unless it can reduce the fistula to the nasal aperture as per this manner.
And proceed as follows: cut it out from the bone again either with iron or with a burning medicine; and when the mouth is revealed, then take the drill according to this manner, its tip should be made of iron and triangular shaped. And let the wood part of it be like a pyramid narrowed down up until the tip, as you can see.
Then place that over the mouth itself: and let it be near the tear ducts: and extend your hand from the eye somewhat.
Then turn your hand with the pincers until it penetrates the mouth, and the patient should feel this: through this, when he finds a breeze coming out of it, while holding his hand on top of his own nose.
So then restore the site with drying styptic medicines, as I have taught you.
And when the flesh is born and the site hardens, then the material which was flowing externally returns to the nose: hence it is lighter for the patient.
¶ On reducing the prominence of the eye. Title XX.
When the eye is elevated with all its entirety, and does not cause harm in use nor diminution, then you must free the patient. Next perform bloodletting on him. Then place suction cups at the neck without incision, but with suction.
Then place on the eye a liniment made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Then bind the eye from above over the plaster with many powders.
And the amount of powders is such that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth is doubled over four times: make them into many: then place them one upon another according to the quantity needed by the eye: then bind them with a hard cloth in a strong bandage.
And repeatedly apply suction cups with suction without incision.
Then remove the suction cups, and allow the eye to be bandaged during the day and night.
If indeed the bandage once again becomes soft, then it must be tightened significantly: afterwards remove the bandage each day and night, as we said.
If you see that the eye has already returned to its normal condition, it is good; and if not, then apply successive bandages, and powders, and tightness, and ventilations, until it heals.
¶ On cutting the Uvea tissue.
Title XXI.
When a disruption occurs in the Uvea tissue, then it protrudes and extends beyond the eyelids like a grain of the Uvea, and causes damage to the human form due to this; and it allows ingress for this: then an operation is performed on it, according to what I describe, and it is that you insert the point in the root of the Uvea from the lower part to the upper part.
Then insert another point with a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and remove the first needle according to its placement.
Then cut into the location of the double thread, and bind it with the portion of the Uvea around a needle: and tighten it significantly.
Then remove the needle, and place a woolen cloth soaked in almond oil on the eye: and leave it until the thread comes out with the Uvea.
Then care for the eye with that, which strengthens it, until the wound heals completely.
And sometimes the Uvea is tightened with a circle of cloth from all sides until the eye attains great elevation.
Then pierce it with a fine awl so that it reaches the depth of the eye, and allows the humidity of almond oil to flow in, causing the eye to descend immediately afterwards; then tighten it until it heals.
The Care of Alcoman.
Head Twenty-Two.
This illness which is called Alcomnati is not truly pus, which accumulates in the eye, similar to water flowing down, and it is not itself.
The method of operation for this involves having the patient sit on a prepared chair or stand straight.
Then take the head of the patient with your hands from both sides, and move it until you feel pus coming down to your eyes.
Next, it is depicted and does not descend, and the passage clears: and the patient sees as he saw before: and if it does not descend below, you know that it is water.
If however the descent of pus with what we said does not get prepared, then have the patient sit between your hands. Then take the spatula finely and make contact with it slightly above the cornal membrane at the junction with the conjunctiva near the corona until pus comes out.
Once it comes out, then pour warm water into the eye that you had mixed with honey: or water in which you already boiled Greek fennel and honey: afterwards continue treatment with other treatments until it heals.
¶ On the care of water that descends into the eye, or cataracts.
Head Twenty-Three.
We have already described the nature of water in division and what is suitable for perforation by speaking about it and demonstrating it. Then take this same thing according to health.
Then it will be necessary to make the patient sit between your hands as a square, facing away from the light, near the sun: and tie his healthy eye, and grip it tightly: then with your right hand touch the eyelid of his eye which has water if that is the left eye: or with your left hand if the eye is on the right.
Then take with your right hand if the eye is on the left side: or with your left hand if the eye is on the right.
Then place the tip of the agathode near the crown along the thickness of the radius in the apparent white area of the eye's lesser lacrimal. Then push the agathode with force, and you turn your hand until it penetrates into the whiteness of the eye: and you feel that the agathode has already reached the empty space.
And the measurement of the agathode's journey to depth must be equal to the space that exists from the pupil to the end of the darkened area: and this is the crown of the eye.
Indeed, you will see these things within the pupil through the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea's coat.
Then place the agathode until it reaches the spot where water is.
Then press it down with a vice one after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person will see that which he opens his vision to immediately, and the agathode in his own eye.
Then rest for a little while.
If therefore the water descends, then remove it slowly after what has left the agathode.
When it is removed and does not rise: then draw out the agathode with ease: and you turn your hand gradually. Then dissolve some clear crystal salt in water, and wash the eye with it.
Then place the entire poultice or oil-soaked rose-oil cotton outside the eye, and let it cool. Then tie the healthy eye with it.
We and those who are of our time place upon him a fine powder mixed with egg white.
If the alum (or galena) does not enter into the eye because of its hardness, since there are people whose eye is very hard, then you must take a tool that is called Alberid, which has this form.
Pierce it only with the circular ring and do not insert your whole hand into the hole; just make a passage to the subtle place under the alum.
Then introduce the alum as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the weak patient a somewhat offset bed where he can sleep on his back in a dark room. And prevent him from any movements and coughing. Provide food suitable for him according to what soothes his nature, and let neither his right nor left hand move at all.
And let the bandage be according to its position until the third day. Then release him in that dark room and test his condition; and make him see things.
And then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary to do that at the time of treatment or immediately after cutting: rather, you should avoid that; because water rises quickly through intense exposure.
If however a warm boil occurs, then you should release the eye before the seventh day: and correct that with whatever stops the boil until it is stopped. Then completely assess its condition and place on his face an opening through which to regulate its use for several days while he remains in that dark room.
Then gradually leave your house and familiarize yourself with your rooms.
And you will know that the student should not be prevented from seeing during zals (a short period of fasting): then he dares to see over an operation.
And indeed, some of those who were from Alayrac have reached us, who said that an excavation was made in Alayrac to create a well, through which water is extracted.
But indeed, I have not seen anyone on your land who has done this; nor have I read of it in any ancient books. And it is possible that this might be new.
And these are the forms of species from the well, so they can stand above it for those who do not know them.
Let them be made from pure air: and may their ends with this have the same fineness of triangular shape, and an acute end.
The forms of the well.
Chapter on the care of the newly born flesh in the nose.
Title: Chapter 24.
Sometimes, various kinds of flesh are born in the nose, from which there is something that resembles many-legged scorpions. From this comes cancerous flesh, stone-like, with a light color, and from it comes soft flesh, not with a light color.
Therefore, for the soft flesh that is neither deceptive nor cancerous among those from such meats, you must make them sit an infant between your hands facing the sun, and open their nostrils, and push a hook into those kinds of flesh. Then draw them out to the outer parts, and when you have identified what you understand from them with finely sharp spathuli (medical instruments), until you know that all the flesh has been completely removed.
If there remains anything from what cannot be removed by its removal, then shave that with one of the fine instruments until nothing is left from it.
If blood is dominant to you, or if a hot boil occurs: then apply something against it as required: or it's from malignant boils, then proceed with cautery on it, until the blood is removed and all tissues are removed.
Then, after making an incision, apply vinegar, water, or wine to the nose.
If, however, the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you will know that he/she/it is already healed.
If instead the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that within him/her/it is newly formed flesh in the upper parts of the nose bones, to which penetration does not reach with an incision.
Then it is necessary that you insert a thread with some thickness, and knots in it many nodes. And place between every node the quantity of a finger or less: and let the invalid put one end of this thread into his/her nose with a stick, or as he/she can do after performing it like the same awer: and he/she pulls out its smell until it reaches up to the nose cavity and comes out above the throat.
And indeed, many times young boys do something similar to this Attom, in schools: and it is a simple thing for him who wishes.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out above the nose, and the other which remains in the nostril.
Then sharpen the knife with the knots that are on the thread. Do this until you know that there is flesh already attached to the knots of the thread.
Then extract the thread: and put on the nose after blood withdrawal the licor that you saturated with the Egyptian ointment: do this for three days or longer until the balm impregnates all that is left from the tissues.
Then place a lead pipe at the end of the thing in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
If however there is a treatment that dries out, use that one.
For the purpose of washing the head, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, do this using something made of silver or metal: it should be similar to a lamp wick, open like a shell, and its opening should be similarly shaped.
And if you wish to make a closed pipe, like a reed.
And the shell of the tool for washing the head should be full, found: it should have a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat it in oil or whatever else you wish from juices and liquid substances.
And this is the form of the tool. ¶ On treating the inflammation of the nose.
Chapter XXV.
Thelul often appears at the tip of the nose, and grows bigger and increases over days until its appearance becomes unpleasant.
And because of this, it is necessary to act at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it completely.
Then place over the site, or a cautery, or a burning medicine that stays in its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed until it grows larger, then consider whether there are stones, hard ones, of a yellowish color, that have few sensations. Then do not touch this with iron, because it produces an inflamed sore.
For I have seen many times when someone is struck by a boil and great mischief befalls him who had it.
And if the boil has a soft touch and is not of yellow color, and you see that an incision can possibly be made throughout it, then treat the patient, and cut out the boil without fear, without trembling: and care for the place with whatever dries and binds it until it heals.
On suturing the nose, the lips, and the ears.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when dissolution of continuity occurs within one of these cartilages, there is little need for operation, unless in certain individuals.
Therefore, when something occurs to someone from that, you should consider if there is a recent wound with its blood: and then join the two wounds together with stitches. Afterwards, care for them until they heal.
And if the continuity of dissolution of the lips has already been separated and each part is now healthy, then it must be that you remove all visible parts from its skin until bleeding occurs.
Next, join the two lips together with stitches and tighten them, then apply powdered dragon's blood and ground frankincense over it. Place a piece of powdered plaster on top of this, along with pieces from another kind of consolidating plaster: and release the bound person for untie after two or three days.
Next, release the patient and change the medicine: and let him go until the stitches fall out on their own. Then care for the person with ointment until they heal.
The method of suturing is to join the continuity or with needles, as we told you in abdominal suturing. Or to join the dissolution with thread, as I taught you.
On the Extraction of Nodules from the Lips.
Head 27. To many people, similar hard swellings to seeds of herbs often occur inside their lips: some are smaller and others larger.
Therefore, you must turn the lip inside out, and cut over every lump of it, and hang it up with a hook, and puncture it from all sides.
Then fill the place after the incision with a paste until blood is drained out.
Then wash it with vinegar and cleanse the area with it until the wounds heal.
On cutting into the flesh born on the gum.
Head 28. Often flesh grows on the gum, which the ancients call an abscess.
Therefore, you should hang it up with a hook: or hold it with forceps and puncture it at its root, allowing pus to flow out, or blood.
Then put on the paste or other止血 powders that have been ground and dried over the area.
If the same flesh returns after healing, for it does return many times, then cut into it a second time and cauterize it: for this part will not return after being cauterized.
On the reason of Teeth with Iron.
Head 29.
Sometimes, in the surfaces of teeth from inside and outside parts, and between gums, there are rough, filthy layers, which sometimes decay, turning yellow and green until corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through that.
Therefore, you must have the sick person sit between your hands, and their head on your breast. And scrape the lump and tooth in which you see layers, resembling sand: until nothing remains from it. Similarly with darkness, greenness, yellowing, and others until they are cleaned.
Therefore, if what is from the beginning of reason is taken away from them, it is good: and if not, then another round of reasoning will be applied to them on the next day, the second, and the third, until the very end reaches the study in that which you wish.
And know that the tooth requires razors of different shapes and various figures: according to how you prepare for your operation. Therefore, the razor used to remove the tooth from the lower part is different from the one used to remove the teeth between them, according to other forms.
And let those razors of these forms, which you see, be prepared for you.
¶ On the extraction of tooth pain.
Head 30.
You must cure the tooth of its pain with all your skills and be patient in its extraction.
For there is nothing that can replace it when it is extracted: because it is a noble substance; until then, once there is no excuse for the extraction of its tooth, then it must be made by the patient to extract itself, so that the painful tooth is solidified and certified as such by you.
Indeed, the patient often deceives himself with pain and thinks there is something wrong with his tooth, and removes it. Then the pain does not subside until the painful tooth has been extracted.
We have already seen that from the practice of bloodletting.
When therefore you yourself verify that the tooth is painful, then you should incise around the tooth with a bistort (a type of tool), where there exists something of effectiveness, until the gum discharges from every part: and afterwards move it with your fingers, or with fine tongs first gradually, until you crush it.
Then you should then place large forceps with good location and the head of the patient between your knees: which you have already held well so that it does not move; and then pull the tooth according to its straightness, so as not to break it.
If however it does not come out, then take one of those tools and insert it under him from every part with ease, and try its movement, as you did initially.
If the tooth has been perforated or corroded, then you should fill that hole with a cloth and bind it together with the end of a thin rod so as not to break it during your tightening when using forceps.
And you should carefully perform the incision around the gum area from every part many times.
And keep your strength, so as not to break it, and let a part of it remain, and heal over the patient from that sickness which was causing him more pain initially.
And beware, do not do what the ignorant bloodletters do during their procedure and due to their rashness above removing him, aside from giving them what we have narrated.
Indeed, they often cause great illnesses in men which are harder to break, and let all of his roots remain or some of them; or they remove him with some of the bones of the jaw: as we have testified many times this. Then cleanse afterwards with wine, or with vinegar and salt. And if bleeding occurs from the places [wounds] (for this happens many times), then rub something with myrrha and fill the area with it. If that does not work, then cauterize it if myrrha fails to stop your bleeding.
The forms of small forceps with which the tooth is moved first, let them be long at their ends, short in their handles, thick so they do not bend when pressed against the tooth: let them be like you see the thick handles, until when you grip them, they do not bite themselves and do not bend. Let them also have short ends, and may they be made of steel or made by folding metal centrally, straight at their ends: and in their ends should be teeth whose some enter into others and are gripped with a fitting constriction, firmly.
And sometimes they make the ends like the shape of a bird's beak which is called a stork, and there is a strong constriction.
¶ On the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Title 31.
When something remains at the site of tooth extraction that has been broken off, then it is necessary to place a bit of butter on the spot for one or two days until the area softens. Then insert with vinegar or forceps, whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called the stork.
The shape of this is that of forceps.
Their ends should be made like a file, or like an almond.
And if these forceps do not yield to you for extraction, then it is necessary that you burn over the root and remove all the flesh, and insert an implement which is called a slender lever whose form is as follows.
Make the briefness of the extremity small, moderately thick: and do not make it damp, so that it does not break.
If therefore the root exits through that, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with these tools when there are forms such as these.
The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is some thickness.
The form of the thin triangular extremity.
And also assist with this tool which has two branches, and this is its form. And with other tools and implements that precede it according to the number of teeth.
And also be assistance with this tool that resembles a large curved hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular extremity in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break; and let it not be damp.
And know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly, other tools are not counted. And the skilled craftsman, with his skillful craft, finds an instrument by himself according to what their operation and difficulties signify to them.
Because there are from the complexities for which the old did not mention an instrument due to the diversity of their species.
If however the mouth breaks from the jawbone, or from other bones of the mouth, or it rots: then examine it over its location with whatever tool and hook that fits for it from the instruments and hooks which I mentioned in extraction of roots, and assist with gestures, whose form is this.
Let there be some thickness in it gradually, so that it can be tightened or held by the mouth with it and does not escape or leak until the mouth exits. And restore the location with medicines suitable for this.
If there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then cut it off from its own putrefaction and care for it until it heals.
On the lock of outstanding teeth above others.
Head 32.
When teeth that are outstanding do not follow their natural course, a foul thing arises through this form: and especially when it happens among women and girls, namely venals.
Therefore, you must consider this. For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, or if its lock (serratura) and shaping are impossible: then extract it. And if it is attached to another tooth, then strike it along with this tool whose form is as follows.
It is similar to a sharp, thin pointed face made from iron, with its very pointed ends.
And let your cutting tool be such that when you strike it many days, and because of the hardness of teeth, and so as not to disturb another from teeth.
If however it is displayed above its own grinding tool: then grind that with a grinding tool made of iron, whose form is as follows.
Let it be entirely made of iron, and its handle finely punctured like a needle with the kind of tool that is used to make needles. With this instrument, the tooth will be gradually ground over many days in a manner that does not disturb the tooth and cause it to fall: then soften it afterwards, and finish by cutting it with certain razors.
If a tooth is broken from which a part breaks and injures the tongue: then you must also grind that tooth until all roughness of that break is removed and it is leveled. And smoothed so as not to injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
On the retention of teeth with golden threads.
Head 33.
When there is shaking and disturbance in the front teeth due to impact or accident, and it's not possible for the patient to hold back what they eat so that it doesn't fall out; and when treatment with止血 medicines does not help: then genius (or capability) exists within them to be held together with golden threads. Because silver turns green and decays after days; but gold never changes.
And let the thread be of moderate thickness and coarseness according to quantity that it might fit between the teeth.
Indeed, the form of retention is as follows: take a thread and introduce its double between two healthy teeth. Then weave with both ends of the thread through the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the weaving to another healthy tooth.
Then repeat the weaving until you reach the part from which you began. And hold your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not removed completely; and let the tightness of your hand when holding the thread at the roots of the teeth not allow it to escape.
Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with forceps; and join both together, and hold them while you move; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth so as not to harm the tongue; then release them as tightly as possible while it remains.
If however they break or slip, tie them with another thread and it will stand with him for the entire duration.
And this is the form of teeth and the figure of retention for two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their original places after an accident, and they are held just as we have described, and remain. And this does not happen unless it is by the hand of a skilled, prudent, and experienced artisan.
And sometimes it is made from some of the metallic bones: and it is done as the shape of a tooth, and it is placed in its place, so that the tooth is protected and tied, just like we said: and it remains and serves him for a long time.
Regarding the operation on the ligament that occurs under the tongue, which impedes speech.
Chapter XXXIV.
If there is any hardness or knot due to the healing of wounds within it, and if this comes from the consolidation of injuries: then produce a hook in that thing, and cut through its width until you hit the ligament, and dissolve the knot.
If blood does flow out, then put over the area some ground substances. If however blood seizes you, then cauterize the area with a light-colored cauterizer which is suitable for this: afterwards take care of it along with other treatments until it heals. On the Extraction of the Ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Title XXXV.
At times, an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a toad, hindering the tongue from its natural function and possibly becomes so large as to fill the mouth.
If therefore you see it of yellowish color, or black, hard, and the sick does not feel it: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
And if it is turning towards whiteness, where there is moisture, then produce a hook into it and fall upon it with a thin lancet, and free it from all sides.
If blood seeps out when you are operating during your time, then place over it pounded garlic until the blood is withdrawn. Then return to your operation until you extract it with its completion.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt: and treat it for the rest of the treatment until it heals.
On the treatment of two tonsil abscesses.
Title XXXVI.
And then either you will perforate him: or it will be torn through itself.
And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is fine: then you must penetrate him.
And the operation upon him is as follows, which you should consider before her own surgery. If he has pus of heat and calm completion, or if it is reduced by some diminution: then indeed make him sit in the presence of the sun, and his head rests in your bosom; open his mouth, and receive with both hands serving him, and press his tongue below with this instrument, which has this form. Let it be made of silver or copper, as fine as a knife.
When you then press it with your tongue and the pus becomes visible to you, and falls upon your own hand: then take a hook and attach him to his tonsil, and pull out as much of it as possible towards the outside, leaving behind some from within the clothing.
Then cut it with the tool using this form which follows.
It is assimilated by chisels, but its ends should be rounded so that each of the openings of the ears is directly sharp to the other; hence care must be taken that it is made of red-hot iron or saturated with oil.
If this tool is not present, then cut it with a filet, which has this form.
Let it be sharp at one end and not sharp at the other end.
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to the same form of incision.
Then after the incisions, the sick person should gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs to him, he should gargle with water in which the pebbles of granatum have been boiled, or leaves of myrtle, and similar items from astringents, until the blood flow stops. Then care for it until it heals.
And sometimes ulcers occur in the throat elsewhere, other than the two tonsils.
Therefore, do as I instructed for the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And indeed, I have already treated a woman with an ulcer that was born between her throat and was turning black, reducing her senses, which had almost closed her throat. The woman was breathing from tightly constricted airways, and she was no longer able to take fluid or water. If she had remained for one more day, or two days, she would have perished.
And the ulcer only rose to the extent that it emitted two branches, until they reached beyond two nasal openings.
So I acted quickly and fixed one of them with a hook.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Then cut it off where you can grasp it from the nasal opening.
Then I did to her what was left that came out from the other nasal opening.
Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue: afterwards, I fixed a hook in the ulcer. Then I cut off part of it, and only little blood flowed out from it afterwards. Thus, the woman's throat was restored, and she immediately began to drink water, then started eating food again.
Therefore, I did not stop repeatedly penetrating the same ulcer for a long period of time. The ulcer occurred in place where I was cutting, until it had grown excessively and reached that point.
Therefore, skillfully and with cautery, excise the boil between the throat.
So it stood after the addition: then I walked from part to part, and did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ On making an incision for pus in the wrist.
Head 37.
When the discharge descends to the wrist, and pus is formed, and it is long, then it is named perpendicular. And if there is a large, round swelling at the lower part, then that is called 'uua'.
When it is treated with what we said about division, and the treatment does not adhere: then you will see that the warm pus has left from it, and it is thin: in this case it must be cut open.
And if there is a round aggregation from it, and does not have its length, and it is bloody, or of a yellowish, or black color, and does not have any sensation: in this case it must be given an appropriate cut to the operation for it.
For there is fear over the weak one.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I said from whiteness and its length, that you have the weak one seated near the sun: and press his tongue with the tool, as was mentioned beforehand. Then attach a hook in the wrist and pull it downwards: then cut it with one or two of the tools I said for cutting two tonsils.
And you must cut from it only what is added above the natural boundary without addition.
For if you cut more from there, you will injure speech and language.
Then after the cut, use what we have described for cutting two tonsils: and care for it until it is healed.
If however, the sick person is frightened by the cut: then it must be that you use your skill in cauterizing him without fear and without dread.
And the measure of cauterization in that is not, unless with sharp water: and it is, that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then press his tongue with the tool we said.
Next, receive the water I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and with it apply heat to the unextinguished sole of the foot, not thick or too thin, filling this tool's cavity with it, which has this shape.
Let the end of his extremity on which medicine is applied have a cavity, as the cavity of the cochlear radius does.
And place the tool with medicine over any one of them: and let the sick person lie on his side so that saliva from his mouth can flow out due to the intrinsic medicine, so nothing descends from it into the throat of him and injures him.
And hold your hand with the medicine.
And you should apply the first of that amount for half an hour, until you notice it has already been weakened and calmed by the medicine.
And if you wish to take the root and enclose it over the radius extremity, and pour the root with medicine, and insert the root with the tool upwards into the tube until the root adheres to any part. Do that many times, until you achieve what you desire for cauterizing the useful one.
Then release it: indeed, it rises and falls after three days or four.
If you need to walk your medicine, do this repetition: and after cauterization, cleanse with the tip of a cone dipped in butter, and clean with what is there in its surroundings from the medicine: and wash it with cold water.
And it is treated externally with ointments, and rinsed internally with gargles, until it heals.
So this is the nature of this kind of treatment - it is healthier and more prolonged due to the fear associated with the operation.
And sometimes it is treated with an instrument even finer than the cauterizer and scalpel: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this manner.
Take a pungent reed and hyssop, and origanum (oregano), and rue, and saffron, and chamomile, and dandelion, and similar herbs. Gather all these together or some of them in a pot, and immerse it with vinegar, and boil it. Let the pot be well rinsed out with a little sediment. In the middle of the pot make an opening through which the conical instrument is to be placed according to this manner.
Make it out of silver or copper; and insert the end that has a small opening into the mouth of the patient until the steam rises up to the instrument above the tube, until the tube becomes darkened much.
Then repeat this several times over her until she recovers.
And be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of spring when the season changes.
Moreover, it adds to springtime: and you should not do that unless at the declination of spring when it is warm.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and compose its bark in the end of it such that the mouth does not get burned: because the bark of the rue prevents the steam from burning the mouth; and this is from good treatment with health.
On the removal of thorns and bones from the throat.
Head 38.
Many times it adheres in the throat, whether it be bone or a fish spine, or something else.
Therefore, you must extract what is above that which falls under the use of an instrument on your tongue, after pressing your tongue with the tool towards the sun, and you will then know what is in the throat.
And if what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must let the sick man eat first before food begins to be processed in the stomach.
Perhaps therefore, what is attached will come out through vomiting.
Or the sick person may swallow a fragment of the nap, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a small piece of dry bread: or he may take a fragment of dried marine sponge: and then he should swallow it, tying it with a string afterwards.
And when it has reached the place where the thorns or bone is, and they are extracted, then it will come out. And if therefore it does not come out with what we said: then use this tool of lead according to this shape.
Let it be thicker than a finger slightly, and at the end of it have a curvature, which he inserts into his throat with ease: and himself hold its head up raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that he does not have a cough and push the bone or spine out with it, or if needed, insert the doctor's hand itself.
But if the sick person inserts it, this is better: because of their knowledge about the location of what is attached: and push downwards or while holding his hand with the tool upwards, the entire thing according to its quantity which is prepared for him until it comes out.
On the Extraction of the Bloodworm.
Title XXXIX.
When treating a bloodworm with what I said in the division of treatment alongside medicines, and if it doesn't respond, then consider doing this procedure in front of the patient's throat under sunlight, or after pressing their tongue with the tool I told you about.
If therefore your blow falls upon the bloodworm, extract it with a small hook or with slightly curved finer tools.
But if it is not possible with them: then take a concave tube and insert it into the patient's throat up to near the throat. Then insert the heated iron part of the tube with fire inside it.
Perform this action many times, and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Then let him receive the treated water, cold, and open his mouth with it: and he should mix his mouth with it without swallowing anything from it; and he shall move the water once an hour after another using his hand.
Indeed, the bloodworm falls off when it senses the water.
If however it does not come off with what we have told you, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs or with a wing using the tool we described for fumigating a snail.
Perform this action many times, because it will eventually fall off.
The method of operation during fumigation is as follows: take a pot in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot should be covered with a cover, having a hole in its center: and the end of the tool is composed in that hole.
Then release the fumigation, and let the patient place his mouth at the end of the tube, closing his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the bloodworm.
For the blood sucker falls immediately.
And if it does not fall, then try the multiple repetitions of the steam bathing.
And the patient can bear thirst, and eat salty food, and herbs, and does not drink water. Therefore, it is necessary for him to leave with this regimen.
And this is the form of the tool used to extract the blood sucker from the throat when it falls upon it.
It is similar to tongs, like you see: unless there is this kind of curvature that enters the throat.
And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called the stork, in which there is the roughness of an emery wheel: when it grips something, it does not release itself entirely.
¶ On the incision of abscesses, and their sectioning, and care in general.
Chapter 40.
The species of abscesses are many, of various kinds, according to how their memory is brought back, namely one and this one in this book: they differ in penetration of them and in the sectioning of themselves by two methods.
One is from the species of abscesses within itself, and that which it contains due to humidity.
And the second method is because of places where it occurs from the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is another from an abscess occurrence in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place, is another from an abscess occurrence at joints: and each of them has its own judgment according to their operation.
And among abscesses are those that should not be punctured until after the maturation of the healing in them and its completion: and from these there are those that should be punctured while they are raw and do not mature according to completion.
Like excrescences which are close to stitches.
Because when an abscess occurs near the stitches and extends to its point of origin until decay sets in around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves might be affected by the operation. This is why that member experiences a closer degree of contraction.
Or if an abscess occurs on the main member: because if you delay incising it until it matures, it may harm either him or through that main part of the body.
Or if it's near the anus, then puncture the immature one: and there is no need to incise an abscess that is raw, incompletely digested, except when it's near the anus so that it doesn't putrefy deeply and spread into the inner parts of the anus, causing a fistula or result in a terminal stage that won't heal. You should know the time for perforating an abscess when it has matured according to completion: and this can be observed at the suppression of pain, the subsidence of fever, the fading of redness, and diminishment in pulse, and sharpness of headache of the abscess: and other signs. And it is necessary that you make the same perforation below the abscess and at its more prominent parts. And let the perforation go through longitudinally in the body if the abscesses are located in hand and foot regions, cutaneous lesions, cords, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal locations where there is no reflection.
In those that reflect, make the incision following that part of the body.
But when the abscess is in fatty areas: then it's better to allow digestion of its contents until confirmation, as we said according to completion.
Because if you pierce it before that, the course of the poison proceeds from there, and there are many ulcers and suppuration, and perhaps the lips become hardened, and its depth.
And some stumps are pierced according to the width of the body for necessity: or according to where the part needs it.
And you should administer a small incision for small blisters and a large incision for large blisters: or many sections similar to the size of the blisters.
And there are blisters where it is necessary for the skin to be concave: and one strikes when it has already become like a patch, and finished at a point that is already dead: as what happens in many cases, such as pus and boils.
And among them are those that are cut with a section having three angles.
And from them is derived the manner of incision as if it were shaped like a leaf of myrtle.
As for the groin blister.
And among them are those where a circular cut and a crescent-shaped cut (lunar section) is administered, and similar ones from cuts.
But for those that do not have a head, such as the shallow superficial blisters, it is necessary to pierce them with a superficial or merely flat incision.
And when there is a large blister that has already accumulated much pus, it must be pierced so that you do not overdo it and remove all the pus at once. Instead, extract some of it from within itself.
Then soak the blister until the next day.
Then extract some more from the pus again.
Perform this procedure multiple times according to the scale until all is released out. Especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man who is decrepit: for with each discharge of pus, the animal spirit is resolved from the animal many times. And perhaps the sick person dies and you do not notice it.
Therefore, take this chapter as a major caution.
And after your perforation, at the point through which you have perforated, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
If therefore the wound from the needle is small, or there is a flat cut, then administer flax oil, or old tallow.
And if there is a large abscess and many perforation裂缝 are present, then you should introduce flax oil into all the cracks until it reaches the inner part.
And if you cut off a part of the skin in the abscess, or hollowed it out: then it is necessary to fill it with old tallow, or as when weaving cloth, or after pulling out wool from flax without moisture: and tie it up until the third day.
Then release him, and care for that which needs to be done with the balm until he is healed.
And if there happens to be bleeding during your time of operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after soaking the cloth in them: and place it over the bleeding area multiple times.
And if bleeding persisted, then it is necessary to administer a regimen and care, as well as powders which I have narrated in many places of this our book, and from division.
And if it is during winter and the area of the abscess contains many nerves, then you should pour on powders mixed with wine and warm oil, and place them over the areas.
And if it is during summer and the areas are fatty, then you should place powders that have been soaked in water and oil, or use them with wine and oil, and make all of that cold.
Once when it will be the third day, as we said before, then you must remove the pustule, and cleanse it, and administer to its care what is suitable for it until it heals.
This is therefore what is necessary from knowledge of the general treatment of pustules.
According to the second part of the division, I have already spoken about every pustule, how the way for its particular single treatment is described in a chapter.
Section on pustules that occur on the head skin.
Chapter XLI.
Small pustules occur on the head skin, and they are from nodum species which contain coats that are their sacks: as if they were swollen chickens.
And their kinds are many.
They are of various kinds: some of them are fatty; and from them there are those that contain a moisture similar to mud; and from them there are those that contain a moisture similar to froth and curd: they are like these, and among them there are those which are stone-like hard.
And when it comes to the section of all and their removal, there is no fear since at their section, an artery does not oppose in a contrary manner.
The procedure for their section is to experience it with the tool that comes after this, which is named the Intrusive Instrument, until you know what it contains.
For if that which contains moisture is the case, then when it is cut during its section along its length, it should be cut superficially: according to this form.
And begin with the cut from line b to line g. As soon as moisture is drained away, then scrape off the lump that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything behind on it completely.
For many times it returns, if anything remains from that. Then immerse the wound in Egyptian balm if it is present; and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with this, and leave it until another day.
For it will decay what remains of the infection. Then spread the Egyptian balm over it twice more, and three times, and if you lack that, until you are sure there is nothing left from the infection. Then treat the wound with the balm until it heals.
And if it contains a fat lump: then cut it according to this shape, having the form of a cross-section: and remove the corners between the sections, and scrape it from every part: and try your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
And if an artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you next.
And similarly do with the boil if it contains stones, from the section and treatment being the same, as we have said. And cutting through the boil containing stones is easier: because there is little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are certain boils located on the head in some people, in which there is no moisture at all.
Simply make a puncture always from the lower part of them, so that the course of healing may move downwards.
Then care for it along with what is suitable for their healing process.
¶ On sectioning the Strobilus in the neck.
Chapter 42.
These abscesses occur frequently in the neck, under the axilla, and groin; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
And concerning those that occur among them in the neck, there is one and many of them: they are generated by each other; and every Strobilus is within its own proper membrane as it is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the forms of these Strobiluses are numerous.
And among them are stony ones: and among them are those that contain moisture: and among them are malevolent ones, which do not respond to treatment.
In the one among them that you see with good disposition in touch, whose manifest characteristic is near to the color of skin, and it moves throughout all parts, and it is not attached with neck nerves, nor with muscles, nor with artery, nor it is deep: it must be removed by sectioning superficially from the superior part to the inferior body part along a line, b. to line g., and remove it from every side: and extend two skin flaps with a scalpel, or with multi-bladed scalpels if needed, as we have mentioned in head abscesses and outside of it, remove it gradually.
And above all caution, do not hit the vein or nerve.
And let the knife not be too sharp: so as not to injure your own hand with the cut, or disturb the patient, and hit something that is unnecessary.
If you come upon a vein, or an artery, or there's an obstacle to the operation, then place in the wound a powdered substance, or certain powders that disperse blood, and tighten the wound, and remove it until the pain of antiseptic subsides and the wound softens: or it may begin to desire putrefaction.
The blood is removed by suction, therefore proceed with your operation until completion.
Then care for it.
If the whole Strophula is encountered, then you must join the lips over two wounds: and then immediately cut it off as soon as you see that there's no excess left.
If however you see that the excess remains due to the size of the Strophula, then you must proceed with cutting its root and removing it: and administer the suture which we said.
And that which contains moisture from the Strophula, puncture it with a superficial incision: so you will see its maturation site: and place the puncture below the part of the body following this, as we said.
Then administer after the puncture, licorium with ointment and similar remedies, so it may heal what remains from corruption, until you see that the wound has already been cleansed. Then care for it with regenerative flesh ointments, until it heals.
The section on the division of the epiglottis in the case of an asp bite occurring within the throat.
Title XLIII.
They said that the ancients made this incision in the epiglottis, and no one has been seen in our land who performs it: and here is the written account of their language.
When they have a synanche (a condition), the division of the epiglottis must be done: because nothing improves through this method: for all veins and lungs are weak.
In those who have a warm pustule in the mouth, or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no discomfort in the passages, it must use the division of the epiglottis, to avoid the destruction that comes from pre-ignition. Therefore, when we make that (referring to a previous procedure or condition), we must divide the epiglottis under three circles of the epiglottis, or four, with a small cut across its width, in the area between two circles, such that it is a cut in the sifacum (a type of tissue layer) and not in the cartilage: and indeed, this location is suitable for division as it is free from flesh and the blood vessels are far from it.
If the surgeon is timid, then he should spread the throat skin with an instrument called an uncus (a kind of hook).
Then he should find the skin until he reaches the passage (the canal): if he sees anything from there, it is necessary to divide the blood vessels.
Then he cuts the sifacum (the mucous membrane) as we have described: and it is indicated after the division of the canal from the phlegm that comes out of there, with what breaks off, and the removal of voice.
And after a certain period, open the wound.
And when the hour comes to fear the pre-heating, join two lips of the wound on the skin, and take out only that part itself without cartilage.
Then administer the medicines which cause flesh to be born (or: generate), until it is healed.
Albucasis said.
The summary of this discourse that we have narrated is an explanation only when one sees that a certain amount of these medicines has been swallowed by the sick person: and the sick man rises above death and wants to be cut with his breathing: they go to the second epiglottis, so that the sick man breathes over the wound site with some respiration, and is saved from death: for this reason they commanded to leave the open wound until the malice of illness is consumed, and the malice of him is three days old, and as it were. Then therefore they ordered to bleed the wound and care for it until it heals.
And this is what I have seen with my own eyes, that one maid took a knife and sent it into her throat, and struck against the part of the bronchial canal.
And I was summoned to treat her and found her groaning, as if the groan of a dead person.
I then examined the wound and found that only a little blood had come out of the wound.
So I concluded that she did not constrict the vein nor the artery; and the air was escaping from the wound.
I therefore treated it, her wound and cared for it until she was well: and nothing happens to the maid except wheezing in her voice: and she returned after days to better dispositions.
Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
¶ On the section of the neck hernia.
Chapter 42.
This abscess is named Gastroceles, it is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
And it can occur in two ways: either naturally or accidentally. Certainly, in the natural case there is no defect.
Accidentally, it occurs in two ways: one of which is like large lumps.
And the other method is similar to an abscess that forms from arterial pulsation.
And there is fear with it, and it is not necessary to presume upon it with iron unless in the part that is small. And you should test it, and investigate it with an introduction (of a tool or instrument).
If therefore you find it similar to a large lump and not suspended by any vein, then cut it like lumps are cut. And extract what is contained within from the gland if there is something inside; or else examine everything of it completely.
Then take care of the area with what needs to be from treatment until it heals.
¶ On the section above the type of Lumps.
Chapter 45. There are many species of lumps and I have already mentioned all their species in the division. And it is necessary that I mention here the differentiation between a lump and an exit (or protrusion), which causes doubt. I say therefore that when an exit (or protrusion) is a warmth and fever, and severe pains until the overflow stops and the corruption is completed; then indeed the fever and heat cease.
When the knot does not have warmth, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them inside like a sack which is their own proper organ, and its color matches the body's color: and they begin like chickpeas, and develop as lentils, both larger and smaller.
And they come in two kinds: either they become fatty; or they retain moisture.
The colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division. So when you come to the treatment of the Node, you must examine it, and first inquire about it with a tool called an Intromissum, according to how its form will be described in the chapter that follows this.
And the method of investigating the question and all nodes is, you should take this tool, and introduce it into the moist area that you find in the node: then move your fingers with it gradually until you know that the tool has penetrated the skin.
Then place your last finger according to the size of the node.
And then remove the tool (Intromissum), and examine what comes out in investigation of it.
If moisture flows out, regardless of its color: then dry it off with a superficial cut, as I said in the other nodes.
And if no moisture comes out in the investigation of the Intromissum, then you will know that it is fatty. Dry it off with a section having a form like a cross, according to this shape as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scrape off the skin from all sides easily: and if possible keep the sac over it so that you can extract both of them (the lump and the affected area) healed together.
If indeed it is broken by the pincers during surgery, and it's not possible to extract it intact, since this happens quite often, then quickly remove that fragment until nothing remains from it.
For if there remains even a little bit, or much, the Knot according to most returns (for treatment).
And if it binds you and leaves a little bit: then fill the wound at your completion with some corroding and sharp powders: and pinch the wound, and put above it what sits an warm pustule, and care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And if therefore it is a large Knot, then cut two of its lips, and care for it with what makes flesh. If however it is against you a pulsating vein, or not pulsating: then press forward, and fill the place with a small amount of sand ground finely, and let that tightly bound thing rest for two days, or three, until the wound rots and stops bubbling: then return to apply to what remains from the Knot.
¶ Concerning external instruments for sectioning and perforation.
Chapter 46.
Among these there are forms of introducers, and they consist of three species.
For among them is the large one, and from them is the medium, and from them is the small.
Let them be made of iron with square ends that taper inwardly, so they facilitate entry into the pustule.
And these are the forms of Experimenters, and no, that is, perforators: and one of them is named burin, that is, perforating. And there are three species of it.
From these, there is a large one, and a medium-sized one, and a small one.
They agree that they should investigate through the stumps, discharges, and sinuses, as well as swellings, from what is between them in relation to the bones.
And for others, they are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles to which felts are attached. These might be made from yellow metal, or air, or iron, or silver. And the best of them are those that are made from yellow metal.
And even experience is gained with the use of black lead, which fits to test for sinuses whose concavities are reflections, so that they might be observed in relation to their own reflections.
And there are again three types of these. Because from them there is a long one, and a medium one, and a short one, according to the size of the opening and constriction of the sinus. The form of scissors, and there are many types of them. Because from them there are simple ones, that have a single curvature. And there are three types as you see: Large, Medium, and Small.
And from them there are Blind Scissors: and there are three kinds of these.
And from them there are Scissors with two curves, and there are three kinds of these. And from them there are Scissors with three curves, and there are also three types of these. All these are necessary in their respective places.
These are the forms of Scalpels, which are used for cutting and scraping Nodes and stumps: and there are three types of these. Since from them there is a large one, a medium-sized one, and a small one.
The ends that undergo section are sharp; other ends are not sharp. They are not placed like this unless they serve for the benefit of removal during fear of incision in Nodules, or of a vein: and through them, the sick is healed, and finds temporary peace somewhat akin to what he encounters at excoriation by charring.
These are Magdeburg and they belong to three species.
They are made from air and resemble Radium with which alcohol is produced. In the broad end, a hidden point of the spatulum is located; in this, it flows into both internal and external parts when desired, as you see.
The form of the spatulum that is hidden between the fingers during excision by charring: and these are not felt by the sick. There are three species, large, medium, and small.
The forms of the Windlasses with which blood flow is cut off: and there are three species, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made of air or lemon, round, somewhat according to their length as you see, and let them be for subtlety.
And it is necessary that these species of Windlasses be large and small with you: so that you may cut off blood at speed according to necessity, and then when there is no medicine present for you.
However, you do not use them in the cutting off of blood everywhere on the body, and you use them only in fatty areas: like behind the legs, and thighs, and behind the arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar places, from fatty lumps, moist ones.
And sometimes they make small instruments similar to chopsticks' blades out of them, according to their shape. These are used to cut blood when it flows from the phlebotomy site, or near a vein incision, or an artery. And sometimes they make round ones according to this form.
On the care of human breasts which resemble those of women.
Head 47.
Sometimes, the breasts of certain humans swell during the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to wet themselves at night), until they resemble a woman's breasts: and they remain ugly deformations.
So, whoever dislikes this condition, they must shave over the breasts in a lunar section according to this form from line b. to line g. Then scrape off all the fatty tissue.
Then fill the incision with ointment from cooked medicine.
Then stitch together the two flaps of skin over the wound and care for it until it heals.
If the breast droops downwards and softens due to its size, as it happens in women: then it must be cut in two sides at their upper parts with two similar cuts of the lunar form, where each is contained by the other at both ends until a larger line contains the smaller one, according to this form from line b. to line g. Then scrape off the skin which is between the two flaps and remove the fatty tissue, and administer what we have said about stitches and powders that are necessary for healing, until it heals.
If you do not make the cut required for it, due to the discomfort of the patient or because of blood discharge: then you must fill the wound with a submerged cayenne pepper ointment and release it until that which remains from the fatty tissue is corroded.
Then care for it until it heals.
On the puncturing of deformities, which happens under the scrotum.
Title XLVIII. These discharges that occur under the titillating (a medical term referring to certain symptoms) are from species of Strophularia which contain cysts, and among these are those that contain moisture.
As for those among them that contain moisture, they should be cut longitudinally at the lunar section, according to this shape, from line b. to line g. Therefore, when everything within the discharge is evacuated through the meatus (urinary opening), then fill it up with a new dressing and leave it until another day.
Then the dressing is removed, and it is treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
And if the discharge is from the species of Strophularia nodules, then cut above it as we said in the division above for Strophulas.
But if the wound extends to this extent and expels pus, then apply a cautery to it, as we said in what was mentioned previously.
§ On the topic of dividing discharges that occur due to an artery and vein.
Title XLIX.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, it often leads to a discharge: similarly, when a vein too becomes affected, leading to a discharge and swelling.
And the signs by which one can recognize that a discharge and swelling is due to an artery or vein are as follows: because when it's due to an artery, the discharge is long and accumulates deep in the body; and when you press on the discharge with your fingers, you feel as if there is a rattling sound within it.
And that which occurs due to a vein is round and prominent on the body.
And section above this pustule is an error, and particularly one located under the axilla, groin, neck, and many other body areas: it is very considerable.
Therefore, its care should be properly regulated with iron, and that which is also present in the extremities or at the head, must also be properly regulated.
Therefore, regarding what is derived from them due to the expansion of the artery opening, find it in the skin section in length.
Then open the section with tongs, afterwards the artery: and free it from tunics until it is exposed.
Next insert the point under it and make her penetrate up to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, according to what I taught you in removing two arteries that are in the vessels.
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligaments with pus, until all the blood contained within comes out, and allow the pustule to drain.
Then apply the treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off. Afterwards, care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If it is a pustule due to the cutting of a vein, then you must hold your hand with what is possible from under the pustule with the skin.
Then insert the point under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate. And there should be a double thread until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie it with the pustule's good ligament: according to what I told you about the urinary ligament, tie it from both parts with its two ends. If you feel that the thread is to be removed, then insert another needle with a different thread completely at the incision site: press and tighten your thread in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its center until when what is inside comes out: then cut away excess skin and release what was tied from it.
Then place over it the wool you have preserved in wine and oil.
Then administer the treatment that is done with ointments and unguents until it heals.
For the abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Head L.
Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess can occur in nerves: it happens due to a blow or results from excessive effort, and similar causes. And they often occur in auxiliary areas, heels, and in any place where joints move. It is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body and it can be found in many positions without causing pain. And when it is tightened with congestion, it feels like a fainting sickness within him.
And it is not an abscess gathered deep within the body, rather it's under the skin and it can move to any part of the body, and it doesn't extend forward or backward.
Therefore, that which occurs at joints should not be penetrated with a tool.
Perhaps there will occur contraction, though.
In that case, for what occurs at the head or on the forehead, skin it with a small incision.
If thus it is an abscess of few threads, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and incise it. Afterwards remove it, and attach the wound to with stitches: and care for it until it heals.
¶ On the excision of appendices, which happens in the abdomen.
Title LI. There occur in some people, many times in their abdomens and in other parts of their bodies, what are called fungi, which resemble mushrooms due to their similarity with them.
Whose root is subtle, and whose head is large, and the lips of which turn.
And it comes out in small amounts: and there is from them something that greatly increases.
And indeed, I have seen a man, and in his abdomen there were two fungi, which resembled mushrooms more than other things: there was no difference between them, the whitish, small roots, and their lips turned inward, they could be found, and moisture always flowed out of them.
I therefore dealt with these, and found them to weigh almost X and VIII ounces in one, and about VI ounces in the other. The operation is performed through the incision of them, which you will then consider. If it is sickly wet, and the color of the fungi is white, wet, having a subtle root: then cut it out with a wide spatula, and ensure there is presence of cauterization with fire before your eyes.
For much blood is expelled during its excision many times: therefore, if blood overcomes you, then apply cauterization to it.
And if you see it weakened, frightened, and timid during the incision with iron, then take a wire made from lead that is twisted in the center, and apply it tightly using an athel (a type of medical tool). The method is as we have described, and release it for two days.
Then add in the fusion of lead.
Therefore do not cease to bind the lead, whenever it is pressed into wax, until it is cut off, and falls of itself without labor.
If however the wax is of considerable thickness on the root, then there is something to be feared and to be taken care of: especially what is inside the belly.
However, it is possible that you may hit its middle part.
Then cauterize it to ensure that it does not escape.
Then take care of it until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to mistake the wax that is of a yellowish color, with few sensory qualities and an unpleasant appearance; for this is a cancerous abscess: and I will speak about it in memory of Cancer later.
Section on the care of the navel region.
Chapter LI.
The navel prominence arises from various causes.
Or it arises from cuts on the belly which are above the stomach, and issues forth through a wound in the belly or intestine according to where it occurs at other sites of rupture.
Or from blood that flows from the vein or artery as was previously mentioned.
Or from constriction of the windpipe within it.
If it arises due to a cut in the siphon and discharges pus: then its color is similar to that of the body's color: and it is soft without pain: and its various locations are apparent.
And if it arises due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is more distinct with what we have narrated.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears: then returns and possibly there is a sound with it: and it is greatly admired at the entrance to the bathhouse, and the effort is heavily exerted.
If it is due to humidity, it is gentle, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor do you compress or add anything.
And if it is due to blood, then with these signs a pustule appears turning black at the root.
And if it is due to immersed flesh: then the pustule is heavy, large, hard, and grows according to a single unit.
And if it's due to wind, then its touch is gentle. And the operation with it is that you should then consider if the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind. In that case, you must refrain from treating it.
For there is fear and panic, as I taught you in the chapter where I said pustules due to an artery and vein.
And if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or furrow: then you must advise the sick person to hold their breath and stand stretched out.
And then, with the signs using hot wax around the entire area of the navel.
Then advise him to be raised up between your hands on his back.
And then surround it with broad spatula around the area of the navel over the spot you indicated with the hot wax.
Then extend half a pustule downwards with a large hook.
And then bind it tightly around with a strong thread or with a sturdy silk ligature string: and let the knot of the ligament be loose.
Then open the middle segment that has been stretched out above the ligament.
If however you cannot find it already captured from the ligament: then pull out the small intestine, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestines towards the abdomen. And if you find hair, then take it with a hook and cut off its excess.
If however the artery or vein is against you: then surround it with much (material or substance).
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert two strong threads into them. And insert two needles into the circumference you made around the incision in a manner of a cross, to make them penetrate.
Then tighten the incision in four places above the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle, and let the area rest until the flesh becomes putrid when stretched: and it will fall off by itself: or cut it down when it becomes thin and putrid.
Then take care of it with what is needed from the ointment until it is healed.
If the naris or opening of the belly button is high from the flesh, or due to moisture: then it must be that you should make a concave incision in the skin, as we said.
And remove the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Then take care of it with what strengthens the area.
¶ On the care for Cancer. Title 53.
For indeed, I was unable to heal anyone from this: nor did I see another before me who succeeded in that matter.
And the operation when it is positioned as we said, consists of proceeding ahead and releasing the patient from black fever on several occasions.
Then if you find the bloodletting (phlebotoma) filled with evident fullness, then do so.
And afterwards prepare the patient for preparation that will precede the operation.
Then introduce into the cancer the hooks that suit it.
Then make the incision into all parts of it together with the skin according to examination until nothing remains from its roots: and let the blood flow and do not cut it quickly but squeeze the areas and remove the thick blood with your hand or with whatever is possible there using tools.
If however the thick flow of blood causes you difficulty from an arterial or venous incision, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ On the Care for Hydrophobia
Chapter 44.
We have now discussed the division of types of hydrophobia, and how water aggregation occurs: and the signs of all types, and treatment with remedies.
And that which is cured with iron, it is nothing but the condition of galls alone: and it is not approached with iron in conditions of tympanic inflammation: nor in the complete condition of hyposarcosis: for that is lethal.
When you have already treated this condition of tympanic hydroperitonium with medicines, and your treatment did not alleviate it: then consider.
For if the sick person has already become weakened, or there is another ailment with him besides hydroperitonium: such as if he has a cough, or a stomach issue, and similar to these: then beware not to treat him with iron: because that is fear.
But if you see a sick person overflowing with strength, there is no mere discomfort from something other than hydroperitonium: and it's not a child or an old person. In that case, the method of treatment for him would be to lift the sick standing between your hands, and have the assistant press his back with their hand towards the lower part of his chest to expel water below.
Then take thornspray (spatula spinosa), according to this shape.
Let there be two parts of it being sharp, long, and with the tip like that of a thornspray (spatula).
However, there must be something slight of it progressively, so that you do not pass with it until the operation reaches the intestine and harm him.
Then consider.
For if hydroperitonium is generated from the part of the intestine, then you must extend with your incision from the navel by a quantity of three fingers, down directly to his chest above.
But if the generation of hydroperitonium is due to discomfort in the liver, then your incision should be on the left from the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then section should be made in the right side. And it must not even be a section on that side where he wishes to lie weak, so as not to let excesses flow onto that vulnerable spot.
And then puncture the whole skin with the instrument.
Then insert into that incision and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin, as if you are scraping it off. And let the amount that is scraped out be equal to a fingernail or roughly so.
And then puncture and scrape until the spatula reaches the empty space; there is a place for water.
Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument of this shape.
And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver, or copper, or brass, thin and smooth. In the lower part of it there is a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two from one side and one from the other side. And the end of it is cut like the incision of a reed, as you see, there is a ring at the top end.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then immediately it descends over the tool itself. Therefore, evacuate from the water the quantity in half an hour.
Because if you evacuate more than necessary from it, perhaps the patient may die by the dispersal of his animal spirits within an hour: or a stroke (syncopa) occurs which approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the strength of its own force, and according to how the sick indicate their condition based on the pulse's strength and its goodness.
Then remove the tool, and retain the water.
What is that, because it gets retained immediately due to the skin which retains the hole that is above the sinus: I have already narrated about it, so that you can puncture him according to this manner.
Then try the instrument on another day, if you see that the patient can bear this one: and also extract a small amount from the water. Do that for several days without fear, and keep yourself away from error: until nothing remains in the water except a little.
If you worry about the patient though, and extract a large amount from the water: then take care of it with burial under hot sand, and excessive sweat in the bath and sun, waiting for immediate recovery: and take care of it with dried medicines until it is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I have narrated about this as a precursor.
Section on the care of infants born in places where their bladders have not been punctured.
Title LV. When someone among infants emerges from their mother's womb, and the head of the sheep (a metaphor for the infant) is not punctured or perforated, or if there is a narrow opening, or it is not in its proper place.
Therefore, one must immediately assist with the puncturing of it when it is born using a slender Spatulum tool, according to this manner.
Then place a small thin claw made of lead in the hole and tie it. And keep it for three days or four.
When then he wishes to urinate, it is removed and rubbed.
Then put him back again.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the spot will not allow him to close.
That is, for someone with a constricted opening, it is treated with lead as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
These however, in which there is an opening not in its proper place, get injured.
This is because in those who are born from them, the opening is at the end of the staff: therefore it cannot mingle with the earlier ones until they lift the staff with their own hand to the upper parts. Neither does it have generation, because the semen cannot come to the womb in its proper way: and there is a very foul illness.
And the method of treatment in this case is for the sick person to lie on his back.
Then extend the end of the staff with your left hand forcibly and cut off the head of the staff's tip from its place, as if it were a penknife cut or like cutting some root so that something midway comes out similar to the head of the staff: and let the opening fall in the middle as it should.
And beware of the blood flow during your operation.
Indeed, it happens many times like this.
Therefore oppose him with that which takes out the blood and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ Concerning what happens to the foreskin and head of the staff, as well as corrosion, darkening, and sticking.
Title 56: The Head
These things often happen to the staff in Albather and it is an abominable growth of foul flesh.
And from that there is one that is malignant and another that is not malignant.
Therefore, it is necessary not to leave the diseased part hanging freely, but rather attach it with a delicate hook and cut it off until you have cleaned it entirely.
Then place over it anointing on the part submerged in Egyptian ointment. Then take care of that with the oil afterwards, until it is healed.
If it's diseased and has an unpleasant color, then you must administer a cautery after making the cut on it and its margin.
If however the disease is found attached to the foreskin and not circumcised, with part of it inside the foreskin and another part outside, then you should remove the diseased part that is inside first until it has healed. Then take care of the external part afterwards: for if you treat them together at once, the foreskin may be torn.
And diseases also occur within the testicles and the dark corruption of the foreskin.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to remove completely what has already become darkened and whatever wishes to decay or has already begun to decay.
Then apply over it afterwards with honey that has already been mixed with flour from grain mills and herbs ground through a sifter.
Then take care of that along with the other treatments until it is healed.
If bleeding occurs, then apply the cautery along with the lunar cautery, according to this manner.
The cautery is useful for two purposes simultaneously, namely to stop bleeding and to treat a wound when it becomes infected.
If the head of the rod becomes infected and destroys it entirely during the night: then you must insert a leaden tube into the meatus of Priapus so that the sick may lie on top of it.
In the case of adherence of the prepuce to the shaft of the penis however, and these kinds of adhesions do not occur unless in someone whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not necessary above it: sometimes adhesions happen due to injury or a boil: therefore, they must be scraped off with an obtuse instrument until the ligament resolves, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
If it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then one must scrape away at the head of the penis and the prepuce.
That is because when the prepuce is delicate, it might be pierced due to its thinness and speedily.
Then, separate the prepuce and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been made wet with cold water, so they do not stick together again.
Then it is treated with an astringent wine until it hardens. ¶ On the cleanliness of children and the treatment after they have made errors.
Chapter 57.
Circumcision is not a solution for any kind of continence, like other wounds. However, since it comes from our operation, with our will, and its use is proper in children, it becomes necessary to mark that operation as better, and to adopt an easier way leading towards health through this action.
I say then that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws and it is only what we have learned through experience.
That is because I have found that a larger part of surgeons and bloodletters use cleanliness through circumcision with the foreskin removed, and with lancets. They also utilize hot fomentation, bind it with thread, and make cuts with a nail.
And indeed, I have tried all these methods, and found no better improvement with hooks, and suture with thread.
For in surgery using new knives, the skin often escapes.
For the foreskin has two layers of skin: perhaps then the upper layer escapes and the lower remains; one is thus forced to make an incision for the remaining layer, and pain will follow.
And with the surgery done through thumbs, that is, using fingers, which surgeons employ, there's no secure cut of the end of the male member: because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In circumcision though, perhaps the blade is used, and spoils your operation: and indeed, children's skin nature is short, and often they're born like that, so they don't need circumcision: and I've seen this already.
Circumcision using hooks and suturing with thread has given me a good experience: because the hooks are proportional to the cut: therefore, the sharpness above is as the sharpness below.
Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they occur simultaneously for one operation at a time: and there is compression like a figure, containing the stick of skin from all parts, with no total error.
The proper method of the operation is such that you should make it known, especially for children among those who understand a little bit more than others, that unless you tie the thread just to the stick and let it go until another day.
Next, make him rejoice and be fully happy about this, according to what your understanding receives.
Then insert your hand to the middle of his member, and blow into the skin, and pull it upwards until the tip of the member emerges.
Then cleanse her from what is collected in that filth.
Then bind the marked place with double thread.
Next, bind below it similarly to that one according to its size. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament for good retention, and cut between two ligaments.
Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and pull out the head of the member.
Then allow the blood to flow gradually out (it is better this way), and place sand above: and over the sand put a cloth that contains the yolk of an egg boiled in water turned pink, mixed with rose oil. Recently good: and let him lie on it until another day: and take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
The form for the tool for cleansing (or perhaps surgery) is this.
Let there be two firm ends, and let them converge: so that no branch escapes in them like the prong of a spear; and let its length be equal to the length of two sharpened points, as the length of two forearms are equally spaced.
However, an error occurs during cleansing: because perhaps the entire skin or part of it escapes at the site of the cut. Therefore, it must be that you extend it from your own time with your nail before dissection of the place: and cut it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
And if three days pass and there remains what is under the rod inflamed, after dissection, then remove that until the scab becomes warm, and scrape it off easily, and cut it according to how you are prepared for it: and be careful from above the rod.
For that will not harm him.
So take care of that with whatever hardens the wound from the powders, which we have described in the chapter on powders. And if it cuts through the skin above the measure and goes upwards, even that will not harm him.
So take care of this until he is healed with what we said.
¶ On the removal of Retained Vrina in the Wound.
Chapter LVIII.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by opilation made from a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar things derived from what we said about methods of treatment in division.
And if the urine does not resolve, and you perceive a retention due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it must be that he should be bound above his knee for rest.
Then have his feet placed on his back, and he should extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and the bound person should try to suck in as much air as possible.
He is thus forced with the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone to the back, therefore urine will be relieved.
If the issue persists after applying what we have suggested and appears to affect something frail, then it becomes necessary to administer extraction with an instrument known as a syringe. This instrument's form should be made of silver, being fine, gentle, concave like a feather from a bird in its thinness, akin in length to that of a single hand or middle hand: within which the needle should be fine at its head.
And the method of extracting Vrina through this is as follows: take a doubled thread, and bind yarn or wool at its end, ensuring good binding. Then insert the thread's end into the lower part of the syringe; should any excess come out from the wool when cut with scissors, simply reinsert it into the tube, just like that.
Next, soak the syringe with oil, or with butter and alum. Have the patient sit on a seat and prepare to apply the blister, using his rod along with moist oils, oil of olive, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the rod with ease until it reaches the root of the rod.
Then double it above the part above the navel. Then push the syringe inside it until it reaches the blister, and the patient should now feel that it has reached its target. This process is not carried out according to this order unless there is a constriction in the passage through which it moves.
Then, gradually extend the thread with wool.
For, indeed, Vrina follows the wool.
Then extract her, and make Vrina flow through the way of urine: continue using the syringe, do not cease this practice until the bladder is emptied, and let the patient experience relief. On the quality of the bladder enema with Clepsidra.
Title LI.
For it is closed, in other words, it is soundproof.
And within it are three apertures, two on one side and one on the other, as you will see.
And the concave spot where that which compels is placed should be of a size so that it contains without addition what it pushes back until something is drawn out with it from the dampnesses: and when it is pushed, whatever is alongside is also forced out far away: as is done by 'clepshydra', which shoots off naphtha, in other words, Greek fire in naval battles.
And when urine is being forced into the bladder, insert the end of the 'clepshydra' into the dampness and draw out what compels it upwards, for the dampness will be drawn into the concave part of the 'clepshydra'. Then insert its end into the rod, as we have described with respect to the syringe.
Then force the dampness along with what compels that, for indeed the dampness comes to the bladder immediately, so that an ill person feels it. The form of thin enemas used when enema-ing the bladder.
Then insert the thread firmly into those holes as they twist. Then join the circle like you would join yarn: after you place in it whatever you wish from moisture, oils, and water.
Then bind it into an instrument and operate with it as you did with the bladder by your own hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Section: On the Extraction of Stones.
Title LX. We have already discussed the division of stone species, and their treatment with medications. We differentiated between the stone generated in the kidneys versus bladder, as well as signs pertaining to this entire process. I mentioned the stone upon which an operation is performed using one's hand or a cut. The stone that is naturally formed within the bladder exists specifically, the one that forms into a rod does as well, and I am recounting these with clear exposition and abbreviation.
I say then that the stone formed in the bladder happens very often to children.
And from its signs, you can see that urine comes out of the bladder similar to water in its thinness. And it appears in it as white sand, and the patient wets his rod with it and works on it continuously, hanging it up many times. Then it is raised, and together with it the anus appears in many of them.
And the healing of children is easy, up until they reach fourteen years old.
And it is difficult for the elderly.
In adolescents however it is medium, in that which is between these: and the one whose kidney stone is larger has easier healing: and if small, it's treatment is opposite.
So when we come to treatment, it is necessary first of all, to cleanse the sick person with a cataplasma, which removes all the feces that are in their intestines: for sometimes it prevents the discovery of the stone during examination. Then the sick person should be taken with their feet and rubbed, and moved towards the lower part: so that the stone may descend to the depths of the bladder, or is flushed from a high location several times.
Then have him sit between your hands, preparing him, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the bladder may be entirely inclined downwards.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the stone in its place, then immediately approach with your section above it.
If however it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand if the sick person is a child, or the middle finger if the adolescent is fully grown, and insert it into his anus and examine the stone until it lies under your finger: and gradually turn it towards the bladder.
Then press it with your finger and push it outward against the place of its section. Instruct your assistant to press the bladder with his hand and instruct another assistant to extend the scrotum with his right hand towards the upper part, while using the other hand to remove the skin that is under the testicles in the area where there is a section.
Then insert the spatulate incision tool, which has this form.
And find what is between the anus and testicles, not in the middle, on the left side: let the cut be above the stone, and your finger be inside the anus. And make a transverse cut so that the outer part of the cut is wide, and the inner part is narrow, according to what allows for possible ejection of the stone from there without being larger than it.
Perhaps if the finger inside the anus compresses the stone at the cut, it will come out without difficulty.
And you will know that the stone causes difficulty in its exit because of those angles and edges.
And it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
To that which has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
If it does not come out like this, then you must devise something over it: or tighten over it with your hand moved off-center, where the end is as if of the moon tightening over the stone and not allowing it to escape from there; or you could insert a fine instrument under it, with its curved tip.
If however you cannot do it over, then widen the opening slightly.
If something is obstructed by blood, cut through with your hand.
If however the stone is more than one, then push the largest one towards the opening of the bladder first.
Then cut above it.
Next, push the smaller one after that: and do similarly if there are more than two.
If the large one is very much, then it is an error to cut over it with a large section.
Because illness befalls a patient with two things, either he is going to die or it happens that there is frequent diuresis: hence, because the place does not completely heal.
True, administer the removal of it until it comes out: or you should use instruments like forceps until you extract him quickly.
So when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with thyme, aloe, and dragon's blood. And apply pressure to it, then place an oiled or rose-scented oil-soaked cloth over it, or an ice-cold water: so that it can cool down the pus.
Then turn the patient upwards on his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
When you then release him, wash the area with water and a great deal of oil.
Then care for it with the balsam and the basil oil until it is healed.
If however there is a hot pus in the wound and corrosive substances are added to it, or if similar things happen: just as if blood were to congeal in the bladder and urine flow be prevented from it: and this can be recognized by the expulsion of blood with urine.
So insert your finger into the wound and draw out that blood.
For if it remains, it will provoke decay of the bladder and putrefaction of its contents.
Then cleanse the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply every kind of treatment that suits from the cure until it is healed.
And the need is for the total time of treatment, to bind two thighs and limbs, because of the medicines that are placed over the area.
If the stone is diminutive and situated within the lumen of the reed, and it gets stuck in it, causing the urine's outlet to be blocked: then attend to that which I will instruct you before you reach the section.
Indeed, through this treatment you have been relieved many times from the section, for I have already proven that. And it is like receiving the perforator made of balsa iron, which has this form, with its triangular end and being sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and bind it with the reed under the stone so that it does not return to the blister.
Then insert the perforating iron into the reed with ease until you reach the perforator to the stone. Then turn the perforator slowly with your hand within the stone. Continue making the perforation until it penetrates from the other side.
Indeed, urine will be relieved immediately.
Then press your hand onto what remains from the stone on the outer part of the reed.
For it breaks, and comes out with urine, and the sick person is healed.
If this treatment is not prepared for you, because something prohibits it from him: then bind the thread under the stone, and tie another thread above the stone. Then cut over the stone in the reed between the two bindings.
Then remove it.
Afterwards, untie the bandage and cleanse the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone, except so that it does not return to the blister: and another bandage above, unless when the thread is untied after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and aids the wound: for this reason, you need this when you tie the thread above, so raise the skin upwards, so it returns to your own part, and aids the wound, as we said.
On the Extraction of Stones from Women.
Head 61.
Stones are rarely formed in women.
If however, such a stone occurs in one of them, then the treatment is difficult, and it is forbidden due to many methods.
One of them is: that woman may perhaps be a virgin. And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a doctor when she is chaste, or with husbands who are present.
The third is, because you do not find a woman who knows this art well, particularly the operation by hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the stone's location: for which it requires deep incision, and there is fear.
Which if necessity compels to that, then you must take a woman who is a doctor, well knowledgeable: and it is found very little.
But if you deprive her of that, then seek out a chaste, subtle doctor, and bring before him a well-educated woman's midwife, or a woman who has taken part in this art: so make her present herself, and above all, have her do everything you instruct her about the stone based on your examination. Firstly, what is done is to see if the woman is a virgin: then she needs to insert her finger into the anus and seek out the stone.
If however, she finds it, constrains him under her own finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the soft abdomen of the infirm one, and inquire about the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder, and compresses it with good pressure. If he finds a stone, then it must be moved gradually from the orifice of the bladder to below with his maximum strength until he reaches its root at the knee.
Then he cuts over it at the midpoint of the ulna at the knee's root, from any preparation part to him, and feels the stone in that part: and his finger does not move from the stone, constraining under it: and let the cut be small first.
Then he inserts the rod onto that cut.
If he feels the stone then he should add into that cut according to the proportionate quantity as the stone emerges from it.
And you will know that the kinds of stones are many. From these there is one that is slender and large, soft and rough, having branches, it can be long or round.
And you should know its type, so that this is shown to you through what you desire.
If the blood overcomes you, then add in the place of zinc a powder, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is removed.
If the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then place the powder on the site, and hold it with a constriction appropriate to the powder: do not remove this: and release the stone, but do not extract it.
Perhaps indeed, the sick woman will die.
Then care for the wound.
Therefore, when the pain of the blood subsides after a day, and the site decays, then return to your operation until the stone emerges.
¶ On cutting through the aqueous hernia.
Chapter LXII.
A watery lump is not an external mass, unless it is a gathering of humidity within the white membrane, which is beneath the skin covering the testicle containing the urethra: and this is called the scrotal sack. And sometimes it is in its own pouch that nature has prepared for it in the part of the urethra until it seems: which is another urethra and is the skin of the testicle between the white membrane, as we said: and this does not happen except rarely.
And the generation of these branches indeed comes from weakness which happens to the testicles: therefore this material flows towards them.
And sometimes it occurs due to impact on the testicles.
This moisture has many colors. Or its color descends to a yellow tone, or it is blood-red and red, or it is feculent, black, or it is watery white, and that which is more.
For if it is within the white membrane that we said, then the abscess appears round to about the length of one as the shape of the urethra: and no testicle can be seen because moisture contains it from every side.
And if the moisture is within its own pouch, then the abscess appears round with part of the urethra, and because of this, a man judges that there is another urethra.
And if moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sac, then it falls under sense.
Therefore, when you wish to perceive the color of moisture, then experience the color of moisture during intercourse with a square insert, whose shape precedes.
According to this, when it emerges in the inquiry of intercourse, judge about what is between it.
And when we come to treatment with iron, then you must advise the patient that if it is possible for him to undergo bloodletting and see his body full.
Then it is covered on its back over the object somewhat high, and place many cloths under it.
Then sit you on his left side, and instruct the servant to sit on his right, who will hold his stick against one or both sides of his testicles, and towards the lower part of his belly.
Then take the broad spatula and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle longitudinally up to near the pubis: and make a section according to the line that divides the skin of the testicle, until it reaches the white sac encompassing it: and scrape him and observe, or find out how to remove him: and let your scraping be with respect to the part hanging downwards more than with the ovum: and carefully examine with the scraping as much as possible for you.
Then puncture the white sac full of water with an open-ended incision, and extract all the water. Then separate between two cuts with the scissors, and extend the white part upwards, and do not touch the skin that surrounds the testicles: and strike it wherever possible to hit it, or entirely, or in fragments, especially its thin side.
For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no security in his operation that water will not return.
And if it proceeds outside its skin before your time of operation: then when you have completed the section, take him back.
Then join the two foreskins with stitches.
Then care for him as you would other wounds until he has healed.
And if you find that the organ has been corrupted by a different kind of blackness, then it is necessary to tie the cords which are the support, fearing blood loss.
Then cut off the testicle with its support and remove it: afterwards care for this with what we have already mentioned.
And if water is found gathered in two parts, then you will know that there are two branches. Therefore cut the other part like what you did with the first, evenly.
And if it is equal to you, as one operation, then do this: and afterwards cleanse the blood.
And insert in the sections wool submerged in oil, or in rose oil; and place another piece of wool outside that which you have soaked in wine and oil, spreading it over the two testicles, covering them with your belly: and place above that double cloths, they are called puluilli, tie these above with a ligament according to this form.
And then take two cloths and soak them, filling the wool with carmine as per this likeness: and make ends that are pressed out from the crotch or wet wool; and they are attached with the bandage at the lower backbones: one end will receive above the anus up to the spine, and the other receives down to the part of the thighs: and both ends over the two buttocks below, and the other two ends on each side of the groin, and the whole band is attached in the lower backbones.
And at times, it is medicated artificially with a cautery in place of the section with iron. And you should take the surgical tool that resembles a fine knife and cut off the skin of the testicles. Proceed as we have described: until when something white, containing water, is revealed. Then receive the cautery according to this form.
The Greek letters are assimilated.
Then pierce it with that sifac and light it until all moisture has come out.
Then extend the sifac with hooks and scrape it using a finely ignited cautery, cutting down on it as much as possible to you until you uproot all of it.
And sweat from the egg, so that the fire does not touch it.
And you will know that this operation is beneficial and lasts longer without bleeding, and it is better than an operation with cutting.
If however it opposes you in the hour of cutting, or in the hour of the hot pustule after cautery application, or bleeding, or something else: then you must treat what opposes you using the treatment that suits it, according to what was previously stated.
If the patient is fearful and does not anticipate this operation due to its horror, then administer the following perforation as I describe it: and it will be.
When you are informed by yourself about the thing that we said about the indications where the limb is watery; then it should be that you make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Then pierce the pustule from its lower part with a broad spatula: and make the piercing along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all water runs out.
Then place a pad over the wound site, bind it in place and let him walk off the excess water residue. Afterwards care for him until the injury heals.
If however a contradiction occurs with the ejection of water during the hour when you pierce it: and if this is not just because; as white flannel creates a contradiction at the wound opening and prevents the escape of water: then it is necessary to introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument used for removing water from hydrophobia, whose shape precedes this method. Or add this process in operation for wounds.
And you will know that the water returns and accumulates around six weeks, or about this time.
And when it accumulates, then it is treated in the same manner, and the patient will pass through his days.
¶ On the care of Ramicis for carnosae.
Title LXIII.
Know that within the section above this Ramicis, there is often a fear of losing one's balance leading to danger in various orientations.
Therefore, it seems to me that its removal would be beneficial from that.
And I am recalling the procedure for that and considering the condition of the patients.
I say that many conditions occur in patients, from which the testicles are composed; and this happens due to multiple causes, namely. Or from acute excess, or sharpness, which flows towards the testicles.
Or from being struck.
And the appearance of an abscess matches the body's color and no pain is felt: and it is serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a phlegm of stones, whose color is dark brown and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it happens due to the knotting of arteries and their expansion; as has already been recalled: or from the expansion of veins.
Therefore, which is due to the expansion of arteries, can be recognized by the position of phlegms when you press it with your fingers.
And it is not necessary to touch it completely.
However, that which happens due to the expansion of veins does not spread out from it when compressed with fingers. And now it's possible that this kind of operation can be performed on top of this specimen and on other meats: and it happens that the skin of the testicles is separated.
Then extend the scrotum upwards and extract it together with its white sitch: and free the suspension from the wounds, and tie up the wounds: and cut off the suspension after you have freed it completely from all parts of the scrotum.
If however the scrotum has been consolidated with those born meats, then it is necessary to hold the scrotum and cut into it. And if there is adherence between something from the spermatic sheath or in what is between the wounds: then it is necessary to free the entire of that adherence and cut it with a round incision.
And if there is birth of flesh in the place of adherence which is behind: then it is necessary to cut all of it and extract the scrotum as we said. And when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with gauze soaked in rose oil and wine: afterwards care for it along with other treatments until it heals.
On the care of Ramicis, which is with Vine.
Head 64.
It is an abscess behind the eye that is enclosed by a certain process, similar to a lump, with the softening of the testicles: and it causes difficulty in movement and exercise for the sick person, and walking.
And in the treatment of this ailment is from fear, due to that which preceded it and is recalled.
However, we must say the operation on it according to how the firsts did it. I therefore say that you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Then make an oblique cut with a broad sharp instrument across the area directly from one end to the other until you expose the instruments.
Then scrape away from every part as we have instructed you regarding the removal of arteries which are in sinews.
Then cut those things centrally with a straight section according to the length of the body, and extract what accumulates from the moist, decayed substances.
Then care for the wound with care of other wounds, where there is a tendency to generate pus, so that the feeding vessels which nourish one testicle fall off.
It is not bad for that reason.
If however this happens with Vitis for all discharges, then it is necessary that they remove the testicles because of this during discharges: in order not to deprive the urine of its nourishment due to an incision and for it to either boil or dry up, or not be beneficial with them.
¶ On the care of the Intestinal Ramus. Head 65.
Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture towards one of the testicles.
And this tear can be either from the small intestine or due to its stretching.
And these two kinds happen due to various causes. Or from being struck. Or from jumping. Or from loud noise. Or from lifting heavy objects and similar activities.
And the sign is when it occurs due to the stretching of the small intestine.
What happens is that it occurs gradually over a long period of time and does not happen suddenly. There is an equal swelling towards depth due to the fact that the small intestine compresses the intestine.
The sign when it happens due to a section of the small intestine is that it causes an intense sudden pain. There is also a different pus visible under the skin close by, and this occurs because of the exit of the intestine and its course towards the small intestine externally.
And sometimes it comes out with the intestine in a bundle: and this is called the Intestinal Ramus and the bundle. And sometimes it occurs with wind.
And sometimes, feces run into the intestines and are retained there: and it is with them the weakness of sick people: because it causes to happen a dull pain, and especially when pressure is applied.
And in the care of this illness's symptoms with iron there is fear: therefore, it must be guarded against such occurrences.
And the method of operation is: to advise the sick person, instructing them to use their hand to return the intestine to its natural inner concavity, if it yields to being returned.
Then they wrap the wound around their neck between your hands: and raise their legs.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the entire skin of the testicles along its length.
Then fix the two edges of the cut like hooks according to your need for opening up the cut with them. And the cut should be made as much as is possible so that it can allow things to come out freely.
Next scrape the scrotum and what is under the skin until when the white fat part becomes hard from all sides. Then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, between that which is under the white fat part under the skin, and that following the fat. Do this up to the part of adhesion in the posterior part of the body.
Next move with your right hand into the inner skin of the testicles: and as you do this, spread the white fat part upwards with your left hand: and raise the body up together with the white fat. And advise your assistant to lift the body upwards too: and then resolve any remaining adhesion, fully completing the separation.
And use your fingers to ensure that there is nothing from the intestine left twisted inside the white hard fat.
If you find anything from it: then urge him downwards towards the belly.
Then take a thimble in which there is a thick thread, formed from a ligature of ten threads: and introduce it at the very end of this structure, that is, the sheath, which follows the section under the skin covering the testicles. Then cut the ends that protrude from the thread until there are four strands.
Then compose some of them over each other with a pattern that resembles the shape of a cross: and tie them together with the asifach (which we have mentioned), because it is located under the skin covering the testicles, tightly enough so that no secretion from what nourishes them can be released towards them: in order that no pus pocket may form there due to heat.
And place another band again beyond the first band, lengthwise from it by less than two fingers.
And after these two bands, release from the sheath which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equivalent to the size of a finger: and cut off the rest completely according to roundness, and remove it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles from where blood flows, and sew properly: as we have instructed in what has been mentioned beforehand.
Then apply the oil-soaked wool and place it in the wound: and administer the bandage we have described.
And sometimes the white sheath that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing blood flow.
Indeed, this happens many times.
And cut the band until it falls off by itself.
If however the case is delayed, then it should be treated with warm water: and place on top of it what we have mentioned until it falls off.
Then care for a wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it heals.
In respect to windy ram's flesh.
Chapter LXVI.
In this, I have not heard of anyone who would dare to use iron in the treatment of ram's flesh.
And first they said that it happens as we have narrated about the ram's flesh which is with the vine.
This is, you bind the ligatures after cutting it over it with ease below: then cut in the middle, and finally, take care of it according to what we mentioned until it opens itself; and the treatment for the wound, as we said, until it heals.
In respect to the rupture that occurs in the groin area.
Chapter LXVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groins as we have said, and the affected area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: if it does descend, then it is somewhat less than what should be and returns repeatedly at all times; but if it continues with that for some time, an opening is added in such a place until the intestines descend into that place.
And this happens due to the expansion of 'sifach', which is located in the groin area as we have said.
This occurs because 'sifach' expands; then the area softens and inflates, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with cauterization, as was previously described.
And sometimes it is treated with iron according to this method: and the situation happens where they lie sick on their back between your hands.
Then cut the protruded and inflamed area of the rupture, cutting through its width according to the size of three fingers.
Then bind the asifa and what is under the skin until when the white fat follows it, that which is beneath the skin following this.
Then take the root and place it on the prominent spot from the white fat, and press it down to the depth of the belly.
Then make two prominent sites on the end of the root from the white fat, and connect one of them with a stitch to the other: then remove the end of the root.
And do not completely cut the asifa, nor stretch any other part, as I taught you about treating intestinal thorns. Then attend to that with the treatment of wounds.
When you then fall upon thread, cleanse that, and heal the wound until it is consolidated.
The asifa contracts and does not extend to the prominence of the rupture.
And it is better to use cautery in this place, because it is closer to health.
¶ Regarding the softening of the scrotal skin.
Chapter 68.
The scrotal skin of some people is softened many times, which causes the surrounding flesh to be softened as well, spoiling its appearance.
Therefore, whoever is asked to treat it must make the sick person lie on their back and cause the entire softened skin to be applied over the natural skin. Then bind the two lips with stitches: and if you wish, remove three or four excesses of the softened skin first, and then apply firm stitching.
Then, the care for the remaining wound(s), until it is healed and the threads fall.
¶ On Castration.
Head 69.
You know that castration is condemned by our law and for this reason it was appropriate not to recall it in my book; and there is no need to remember it unless for two reasons.
The reason is that one of them is so that this should be known to the doctor when he is asked about it and thus he would know how to deal with someone who has undergone such a procedure.
And the other reason is that we often need to know about castration of certain animals for our benefits, like with rams, horses, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration can be done in two ways. Or through attrition.
Or through a crack and division.
In the case of castration that is done through attrition, the method is: to make us place the animal in warm water until his testicles soften and become soft and hang down. Then remove them with your hand until they dissolve and no longer appear under touch.
In castration through a crack and division, you must hold the animal and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that done through attrition because with attrition perhaps something may remain from the testicles which would cause the animal to desire copulation.
Then care for the wound until it heals.
The treatment for the Hermaphrodite in two ways.
Head 70.
The Hermaphrodite is according to two methods from humans.
One of them is because it appears in him what follows the space, or under the skin of the testicles, in which there is a shape like a female head, in which hair is present: and sometimes urine flows from that which is under the skin of the testicles.
In women however there is a single species and it's like the head of a female on top of the pubis just like small testicles in men, standing out to the external side: of which one is like the prepuce of man, and two are like two testicles.
And the treatment for the three species, two from men and one from women, is: because it must happen that you enter the added flesh until the impression of them goes away.
Then care for these with the remaining wound's treatment.
As for the second species of men, from which urine comes out, which is under the skin of the testicles, there is no operation and indeed its treatment in full does not exist.
¶ On the excision of the Tentillum, and the projecting flesh in wounds of women.
Head 71.
The Tentillum perhaps adds upon the natural thing until it is torn and its appearance becomes ugly: and sometimes it magnifies so much in some women that it extends like in men, and arrives up to intercourse.
Therefore you must hold the excess of the Tentillum with your hand or using a hook, and enter: and do not stop at the incision, especially at the depth of the root: so as to not occur bleeding.
Then care itself for the treatment of wounds until they are healed.
And flesh having come forth, it is the flesh that is born in the womb's opening until it fills it up; and perhaps it will emerge towards the exterior according to the likeness of a tail: hence some call it the illness with a tail.
So we must treat her as we would treat a Tentigine, and care for her until she is healed.
¶ Concerning the treatment of Albritic, which is the womb of an unperforated woman.
Title 72.
Alratica refers to the womb of an unperforated woman, or one with a small opening.
And it can be natural, or accidental.
Accidental Alratica results from an illness that preceded it. It can be formed by added flesh, or something thin like a needle, or thick, and might occur deep inside the womb, on its sides, at the top of it, or at the bottom. It prevents sexual intercourse, fertilization, childbirth, and possibly menstrual cycles as well.
And knowledge of that is made through the observation of midwives, if pregnancy is clearly apparent nearby.
But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or with the help of a rod.
If pregnancy is due to something thin like a needle and is located between the two lips: then approach it gently, and break it.
And you should place it over the two small lips.
Then put your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread.
Then widen both lips with strength until the delicate sifach is broken and the wound opens.
Then take the wool and soak it in oil, then place it on the site. And let a woman defile herself every day there so that the site does not become solid instead of other things.
If however the sifach is large and thick, then it is necessary to separate it with a broad spatula like a laurel leaf.
If the wound is born from flesh, then hang it with hooks and cut it. And have with you medicine that stops bleeding without cauterizing, such as Acacia, dragon's blood, and a mixture added with urine.
Then administer a large lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly or at all, hold it for several days. Then apply linseed oil and afterwards treat the rest of the healing process until it is healed.
And sometimes they are born inside the body of others born: hence it must happen according to this method: while there is no pustule for a tumor, for one that is within the womb is not opposed with iron at all.
¶ On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelil and Bothor's redness in women's wounds.
Chapter 73.
Hemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the venous canals, until a large amount of blood flows from them regularly.
When therefore hemorrhoids occur, they produce Athelil. And I have already discussed this among the division of their types and their signs; now I will explain what receives treatment from them, and what does not.
I therefore say that hemorrhoids which are within the birth canal and do not show themselves to touch: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
As for those among them that are within the birth canal where sensation falls, they are which are treated.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the woman into a cold house.
Then extend with thongs or with rough cloth, and strike them from their roots.
Then, while the blood flows, dust the area with one of the cutting powders without cauterization: like Acacia, dragon's blood, and oil, and similar items.
Then push her feet towards the wall for one hour.
Then place her in cold water.
If the bleeding persisted: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and rind of oranges, and egg shells, and similar items.
Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a paste with it on her back.
If therefore the blood is taken with it, it is good: and if not, make the back and breasts stick with suction cups, without incision.
Then take wool and immerse it in the extract of garlic, or in the extract from an ox tongue, or in the juice of branches of the alaulat tree, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and make it stick with beeswax.
When the blister then rests, take care of the area with ointment until it heals.
Albarth is similar to the red heads of thorns, and has an abrasive appearance.
Therefore, you must enter what appears from it, according to what I said about in thelil equally: and take care of it until it is healed.
¶ On Perforation that occurs in the matrix.
Head 74.
Many species of abscess occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and stone abscess, and ulcers, and scabs, and boils, that is, herpes, and blisters, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and warts, and thelil, and hot abscess.
And indeed, I have already mentioned all these illnesses and their species, and the symptoms of them, and their treatments. It is necessary that I speak about hot abscesses which occur in the matrix when they are formed from abscesses that collect pus, and one must know how its opening occurs with iron.
Therefore, you must consider this.
Then if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with a strike to it, and heat, and fever: and you see it become red: if it falls over it upon sensation, then do not twitch when perforating it: and take care of it with him so that it benefits in maturation, until when the intensity of accidents quiesces.
Then you must have the woman sit on a chair with two seats that bend under her buttocks, and recline, or she may rest against her back and gather her feet towards her lower abdomen: and let her thighs be spread out, and place her arms under her knees, and tie each one with a ligament to this.
Then the midwife will sit on the right side, and she administers the tool that opens the passage of the matrix.
The form of whom comes about in those that are behind.
And it should be that when you wish to administer this tool, you hold it with the tip of the radio deeply in a woman's womb: so that which goes out from the tool is not more than the depth of the womb and does not harm the patient.
But if the tool is larger than the depth of the womb then you should place cotton over the inner lining of the womb's depth, so that the whole entry of the tool cannot reach into the womb's depth and to prevent the whirlwind, which runs in the tool, from going all the way down the side. And one must hold the instrument and rotate the whirlwind until the womb's depth opens.
And when the exit appears and is touched by hand and feels soft and fleshy, then one should take it with their head using a broad spatula.
And when it is discharged cleanly, then you should place the lid of a wound submerged in rose oil: or in green oil where there's some firmness. And place the lid and extract the section within the womb deeply.
And place it outside over the womb and over clean cotton cloth submerged in water in which the apples have boiled.
Then heal with the appropriate ointment for two days, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that they are rinsed with water and honey: then rinse them again with water in which the root of the lily or long aristolochia has boiled. Then return to using the ointment.
If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then you must avoid treating it with iron instead, indeed treat it with what we said about division.
The doctrine of obstetrics, how they treat embryos alive, according to a figure that is not natural.
Chapter 70.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to first know the natural figure of childbirth.
From these signs you can tell: when you see a woman pressing towards her lower parts, and desires to sniff the air, and rejoices over what is upon her regarding childbirth, and hastens the birth of the embryo: then you know that this birth follows the natural figure, and it is its exit above its head, and with its second stage: or suspended, or hanging from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary for her belly to be pressed, so that the embryo may quickly descend.
And anything else beyond this birth is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
Because sometimes it begets the fetus on its feet, and its body goes out before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hand go out: or its abdomen emerges: and perhaps it turns upon its own neck, and similar things from unpraiseworthy figures.
So it is necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how the skill is in that, and it is explained through this, and it is established upon him.
When the fetus emerges above its head in its natural egress and it becomes high upon her, making childbirth difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a chair, or women hold her up. And let her inhale steam with boiled garlic and with humid oils.
Then the midwife will introduce a small spatula between her fingers and find with it the second part, and clean it with her finger until she has removed everything that is in it from moisture: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it still does not descend, then the woman should be treated with a senna enema, mixed with safflower oil.
Then instruct her to be squeezed after the enema, and have her blow her nose when she sneezes, and hold her mouth and nostrils together for a moment.
The fetus will immediately come out.
If two hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary to gradually reduce them with ease.
If it does not obey at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat and lift her feet upwards: then strike the seat against the ground: and let the woman be held so that she does not fall upon the impact.
If the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them, and extract the rest of the fetus: and tie his hand with a cloth, and pull him out evenly: for he will come out.
The exit of the embryo over its feet.
When the fetus comes out over its feet, then it must push them upwards: afterwards turn the fetus gradually: and then settle him.
Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When they come out up to the thighs, then instruct her to be squeezed, and have her blow her nose when she sneezes: for she will come out if God willing.
And if it does not come out with what we have told you, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place him according to the natural figure.
For then he will emerge with ease.
If it is prevented from doing what we have described: then take of the high gum, and of the safflower oil, and dissolve the gum: and crush everything in a mortar until it is well crushed. Then mix it with the hair of a woman, and below her waist.
Then make her sit in warm water until she feels the womb descending.
And when you see that her lower parts have warmed up, then make her drink some myrrh and let it take effect.
When she has retained the drink for an hour, then make her sit on a chair.
Then make her sneeze: and pinch her mouth and nose, and gently press the lower part of her stomach.
The urine will immediately emerge.
The birth of the fetus is over, above the knees and hands.
When it emerges according to this form, then guide its passage with your hands gradually.
Then the woman is to be laid on her back with her neck supported by a pillow, and her feet hanging down below. And she herself should lie on the bed, folding her hands.
Then gently press on her stomach gradually.
Then remove what is under her feet from the uterus until she is ready in the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Then press what is above the womb gradually until the fetus ascends to the higher parts.
Then insert her hands and gradually adjust the position of the fetus: and instruct the woman to compress herself until the fetus emerges.
The outcome is a fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
The method for reducing (or correcting) the position of their hands is devised.
If she cannot reduce it, then lift up the woman and make her walk.
If she cannot walk, then have her lie down on the bed: and shake her legs vigorously.
Then apply the ointment you prepared from mucus.
If she has received it and gives birth, then have her sit on a chair.
Then focus on reducing her hands, and place the fetus according to its natural shape: and have the woman sneeze, and instruct her to press herself until it comes out.
The outcome is for the fetus to be on its head, with its arms extended, and it presents its face towards the mother's back.
The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually rotate it, and ease it into position with facilitation.
When it is aligned, then place upon the oil mixture for which we have instructed from oil and mucus above.
Then instruct her to move gradually.
When you have done that, then have her sit on a chair, and instruct her to lean towards the right side.
Then instruct her to press herself: and have her sneeze vigorously.
The prepared fetus is placed on the side for delivery.
When it descends through the mother's opening according to this manner with a thread, then cut the thread using your nail until it is freed by moisture.
If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it out from the belly button: so that it does not get stuck and dies.
Next, urge the fetus towards the insides until you place it according to what is necessary: and advise the woman to press herself occasionally: for it will come out through a slight opening.
分娩双胞胎，或是多胎的分娩。
Know that twins often give birth: and sometimes they give birth to three, and four.
But this is an unusual occurrence and happens rarely.
However, there are five things that occur outside the natural order and do not survive completely: they contain them although they multiply into a double unit, and separate them through a siphon, distinguishing each one by their umbilical cord which is tied together.
And sometimes they come out like one fetus comes out naturally, easily: and they come out through an impossible opening, as we have told. And if some of them are difficult during childbirth and resort to what we said about the unnatural figures, then treat them as we have instructed: let there be a fine forceps, and perform its actions with ease and delay, and adapt it according to every figure using whatever is prepared for him by someone skilled in medicine for his benefit.
Sometimes within the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed: and it has been confirmed to me that a woman who was miscarrying gave birth to seven, and another fifteen, all of them fully formed.
What has been done is the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore, everything should be known in the science of Obstetrics. Perhaps it will come to resemble that similar one; therefore, compare it with what needs to be done.
Section: On the removal of dead fetus.
When treatments for a dead fetus with what I said about dividing the drug mixture, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with your hands, then you should consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound virtue, and not with any from among those accidents by which loss is feared for her: then it must be that she is laid on a bed on her back, facing upwards, and her head is bent downwards, and her legs are lifted. And the attendants should hold her at both sides or tie her to the bed, so that her body does not move when removing the fetus.
Then moisten the womb by using oils and mucus from high fennel and linseed. Then, the midwife will moisten her hand with these oils and mucus: afterwards, she will insert it into the womb with ease.
Then, searching for where within her the midwife should place the hooks of the fetus, and finding the appropriate locations for this.
So consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then fix the hooks on its eyes, or around its neck, or in its mouth, or on the palate of itself, or under its beard, or in the gullet, or in the vicinity of its ribs, and below the pubis.
If the descent is over his feet, then in the heel, and in the middle of its ribs.
And it must hold the hook with his right hand and place its curvature in that which is between the left hand's fingers: and he should insert it with ease using the hand until he fixes the hook in one of those places we described, until he reaches an empty spot.
Then extend with an equal expansion, and do not make the extension only according to straightness; rather move it towards every part so that its outlet is relieved: just as happens when a tooth is being pulled out in dental extraction.
And it must be soft and relaxed where there is that, regarding the extension.
If a portion is being held from there, then it should be that the midwife oils some fingers and inserts them from a side, so that she can rotate with them what is being held.
If therefore a portion of the fetus emerges, then the hooks are changed to another position that is higher: do this until the entire fetus has emerged.
If therefore the hand emerges before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constriction: then one must fold a cloth over that.
Then pull it out until when the whole of it has emerged, cut it either at the junction of the sole or at the elbow: and you should do this both in the other hand, and with both feet.
If however the fetus's head is large or a constriction occurs during its exit, or water has accumulated in the head: then it must insert the Spatula spinosa between the fingers and guide its head while extracting the water with it: or break it using the tool called Almisdac; which shape comes after all other tool shapes in this chapter.
Similarly, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it should extract the algengamath: or remove it with the misda, as we said.
Then grasp the bones with forceps.
And if the head is coming out and it's being constrained at the waist: then one should pull until moisture begins to pour out from inside the chest.
But if it is not complicated and does not yield to the delivery: then strike the head quickly, according to what you are able.
And if it is in or below the belly, or there is water retention in that area: then you must puncture it until moisture flows out from it.
And if the fetus is above its feet, then the pull on it will be easy and the direction to the maternal opening will be gentle.
And if it's being constrained at the belly or chest: then you should pull it out with the cloth you wrapped around your hand: and strike the belly, or chest, until whatever is inside them begins to flow.
And if the rest of the limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand. And if the maternal opening is open, then she should insert her hand deeply into the womb and seeks out with it the head, pulling it by the fingers until it reaches the maternal opening: then she should insert one hook or two hooks in it and pull it with them.
And if the maternal opening is constrained due to a hot pus that happens to it: then one should not labor on it, rather one should then administer an emission of humid things and greasy substances. And apply ointment: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
If the fetus is above its own side, then it's possible for it to be balanced: then what we said about a living fetus will be administered.
If it is not possible for that, then an immediate failure has occurred, and extraction should take place.
And you must ensure that nothing is left from the second stage entirely inside.
So when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about the hot inflammations that occur in the womb.
If blood flow occurs, then move to cold收敛 water, and administer the remaining treatment.
And indeed, I have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; subsequently she was pregnant with another one, then yet another fetus died.
So after a long time, an abscess occurred at her navel and swelled up until it opened, and she began to expel pus.
I was therefore summoned for her treatment and I treated her over a long period of time, yet the wound did not heal.
So I applied certain strong plasters on it and from that place, an opening appeared.
Then after some days passed, another opening emerged.
I was therefore surprised at this, since there is no hole in the womb.
So I reasoned that they were from the bones of dead fetuses.
I examined the wound and extracted many bones from it while the woman was in better positions. And she had been living through this for a long time and now only slightly expels pus.
And I did not attach this foreign body here unless it was necessary because there is knowledge and assistance for what the skillful doctor, using his hands, does in treatment.
On the forms of the necessary instruments for the extraction of the fetus.
Title 77.
Below is the form of the Stricter, with which the volumes are adjusted, having two twists each at both ends of two pieces of wood.
However, this Twist must be finer than the Stricter: and to make it so, either use wood of ebony or wood of the tambour.
And let the width of all the wood be as if it were two fingers: and each edge of both is like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same type of wood which have already been fixed on both ends, whose length is half a palm and slightly more than that: and the width of each is as if it were two fingers, or slightly more.
And those two additions penetrate the womb's mouth so that it opens when you rotate two twists with them.
The form of the Twist which opens the womb.
Another form similar to that one, but finer and lighter.
Let it be made of wood from ebony or tambour, according to the shape of forceps.
However, there must be two additions at its end, as you see above: and the length of all those extensions from them is like a palm; and the width of each one is two fingers.
So when you want to open the womb with it, then have the woman sit on the bed, hanging her legs down, with what is between her thighs open.
Then, introduce those two additions joined together into the womb: and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the tool as you do with tweezers, evenly according to the amount that can be achieved from the opening of the uterus passage, until the midwife does what she wishes.
The Form of Dizziness, as the ancients said, is the Form that Drives, in which the fetus is pushed.
The Form of Almisdac, by which the small head is delivered. The Form of One Holding a Prick or刺.
The Form of One Holding Two Spurs.
The Form of the forceps which has teeth like those of a saw, by which the head of the fetus is delivered.
The Form of One Having Two Endings for Cutting Off the Head.
The Form of Two Spatumils, also suitable for labor.
All of these instruments can be used, and the more their various types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the swifter they are for their task, and the higher in esteem among men due to their quantity.
Therefore, you should not disdain any of these instruments that may be prepared for you.
It is undeniable that their necessity is beyond reproach.
Section on the Extraction of the Second Member.
Head 78.
When Secundina is retained during childbirth, then you must encourage the weak one to hold onto her breath.
Then make her sneeze as you press against her; and place your hand over her mouth and nose.
If she then escapes through this method, it is good.
If not, then take a pot and pierce in the lid an opening; and put inside it opening herbs of the birth canal, like that of the reed, myrrh, and poppy, and chamomile, and ginger, and lignum cinnamomi, and centaury: take all these herbs or some of them, and immerse them with water, and place them on fire.
Then place a sheaf of reed over the opening of the pot lid, and another end of it in her birth canal: and let her hold onto it until steam reaches the curvature of the womb.
Then make her sneeze as we have said.
Indeed, Secundina will then come out with ease.
However, if it still remains after this treatment and does not escape: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand into safflower oil or althaea mucilage. Then she should insert it into the uterus and search for Secundina with it.
Once she finds it, then take it and gradually extend her out.
However, if it is attached deeply within the womb, then insert her hand as we have described until she finds Secundina. Then gradually extract her with a gentle pull, ensuring not to cause the uterus to fall due to harsh pulling. It should be done with ease alternating between the right and left sides. Afterwards, add an amount equivalent to the force of the extraction.
Indeed then it obeys, and is served, and treated against sticking.
If the womb's mouth is constricted, as we have already narrated: care for it with a sneeze, and from the medicine of the pot with herbs.
If it does not come out as we have described, then beware that you do not tire yourself over her in the process of extraction.
However, it must be that whatever comes out from the womb's opening is tied to the woman's hipbone.
Then, cleanse her with a tetrapharmaceutical ointment enema.
For it will decay after days, and dissolve, and come out.
However, when it decays, an unpleasant smell rises to the stomach and head, and this harms her.
Therefore, appropriate inhalations must be administered for that.
Some of the old experts already know how to perform an inhalation with watercress and dried fennel.
The shape of the instrument used for inhalation by a woman during retention of Secunda and menses is as follows.
Make it similar to an ashtray or out of wood; place the broad end on fire: and have the inhalation placed above the plums: hold it until that inhalation is consumed: and repeat another one.
Section 42: On the treatment of Unperforated Anal Fistulas
Chapter 79.
Many infants are born and their anus is unperforated, which the siphon has already slightly filled.
Therefore, the midwife should pierce that sphincter with her finger: and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp spoon: and beware of tearing, do not let it touch him.
Then place over it wool that has been soaked in wine and oil.
Then take care of it with the ointment until it is healed.
If you fear that it will be removed, then place a tube made of lead in the hole for many days, and it is removed when the child wants to defecate.
And now, an eruption occurs in Ani as well, due to the healing of wounds or ulcers.
Therefore, that consolidation must be cut off, and then take care of it using what we said about treatment and lead. Section on the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Chapter 80.
Fistulas that occur in the lower region are Nodation and Enlargement which happen near the anus: or within the space of one part: and there is either a single fistula, or multiple ones.
And when that nodulation is opened, it is drained, and moisture or subtle pus runs out from it.
And sometimes these fistulas have penetrating ones from them.
And there are fistulas that originate when they penetrate through the space up to a blister and even up to the flesh of the bow.
And there are penetrating fistulas that go as far as the joint of the thigh and even to the tail's knot.
Therefore, to recognize whether the fistula goes up to the anus from one that does not penetrate deeply, you can insert your index finger into the anus. And if you insert a subtle probe through air or iron into the fistula, when there is no twist, it confirms that the fistula extends as far as the anus even in cases of non-penetrating fistulas.
If there is curvature within it, then introduce into it a尝试subtle lead wire, or a thorn from the hooves of horses, until you feel the wire or thorn in your finger.
If you do not feel the entire object, and there is no discharge from the hole with any output, nor a sensation of air passage, nor like a worm as I said: then you will know that it is penetrating. So proceed to treatment accordingly.
And when the fistula is penetrating up to a blister, or to the bladder of urine: then its indication is the discharge of urine from there, and the prohibition of it from this so that the site can be strengthened with medicines.
If indeed it is penetrating up to the joint of the thigh, or to the mouth of the thigh: then its sign is that a probe will come through until there, if there is no curvature up to the mouth: and finding pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always emerges from there: and that medicine cannot be effective in it, nor does consolidation occur with ointment.
And in all these penetrable fistulas there is no complete cure: and the treatment of them is a task and futility for those who create it, out of foolish doctors. In those that are not penetrable and not old, recovery is hoped with compression: as I tell you, and I have already tested it: and there is the case where they lie sick between your hands on their back: and raise his legs up to above his hips, and his thighs be inclined towards his belly.
Then introduce the lead or air, if there is curvature in the fistula, until you know where the probe has gone.
If however the sick person feels it around the anus, then you must introduce your index finger into the anus.
If indeed you feel that the probe has already penetrated through itself by way of detection within your finger or between it and flesh, then certainly you will know for sure that it is penetrable. Therefore there are no efforts to be made in such an affair, because there is no cure for him as we said.
They said however, that the flesh heals in certain men, and by the medicine with which one hopes for his benefit, it is that fine cautery is performed according to the width of the fistula as previously described, and you insert the ignited thing into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Then perform this procedure twice or three times, until you know that all the added flesh, which is like bird's feathers tubes, have been sufficiently heated.
Then care for this with bandages soaked in butter until the heated flesh comes out: then care for it with ointments that generate tissue and strengthen.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it shall not be cured with any other treatment either.
And if the probe emerges and does not reach up to your finger which is at the anus or there's a thick layer of skin meat in between it and the probe, or flesh: then you would see that there is a fistula within what follows the skin surface. Then cut away the skin from the start of the fistula, and as you are pulling through with the probe, anything within the fistula until the cutting reaches where the tip of the probe reaches, and when the probe is pulled out, it will fall out.
Then cleanse those flesh pieces that resemble bird's feather tubes, so that nothing remains from them.
If however blood overcomes you and flows between you and your operation, causing those flesh pieces to fall out, then it is better what happens next and for swifter aid, to cauterize that with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Because when cautery is combined with fire, it adds the heating of those flesh parts, and the cutting off of blood, and drying out of moisture.
Then the care is to have it wrapped with lice in butter or crushed fat until the place emits pus and those flesh parts that are heated by pus emerge.
Then the care is to have wounds with salves that harden and generate tough flesh: and these are medicines which have compression and drying.
For when they heal again, then the wound is truly healed: and you do not seek repetition. But if the fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus and extends due to the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
But if you feel it penetrates and there is a layer of pus or flesh between you and it, whether close to the penetration: then there is no operation in that case unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Which is that one of the three methods administered in it: either by applying cautery to it as we said: or by excising it until you find its cavity, so that it will be possible for you to insert a ligature and to treat it with proximity.
And do not proceed too much with the cut, so as not to enter a duct containing the anus, and result in an unwanted discharge without意愿 for the sick. Then follow this care with what we have said. Perhaps it will be healed: or you may lengthen the layer of pus and cleanse it after cutting it close to the anus as we have said, or upon touching, or with another sharp tool at its extremity.
Then cleanse those cut flesh masses which are within the section, as far as you can with examination.
Then attempt the restoration of all wounds with the whole section, and the upper opening where it is consolidated: and there will remain an open fistula within the part of the anus, and it will be easier for the sick person.
And sometimes the fistula is sewn according to this manner: and it is thus, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it's in the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus. Then take a probe at the perforated end, which is like a needle, that is, prepared intestines, according to this form.
And insert a thread withdrawn from five threads into it, and roughly around that area.
Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until you reach its concavity.
If therefore it penetrates into the edge of the anus internally nearby, then withdraw the thread from that hole: so that you can insert your finger into the anus and remove the end of the thread, and unite both ends together: and tighten both, and release them on one or two days: and the longer the thread goes into the flesh, tightly pull it until those tissues between the two ends of the thread fall: then care for the wound, until it consolidates and heals.
For it is not within your ability to do this for the sake of the scab, so that you might not hit it [the probe].
Then proceed with it as we have said, until it heals.
The shape of the Spathamils pin-like instrument used for making a fistula, whose sharp part is strongly acute and the other part is not so acute to avoid hitting what is unnecessary, as you see.
On the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows out after the operation, and care for fissures.
Title 81.
There are two ways of having hemorrhoids.
Or indeed they occur inside the anus, similar to blisters or pieces of coal, or like small grains.
And from these there are those that are single and large, and blood flows out of them always; there is one kind like this and there are many.
And they occur outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that occur outside the anus are generally of low moisture content, from which yellowish water or a slight continuous flow of blood emerges; and they are according to the color of the body.
The treatment for those inside the anus is to advise the patient to take a bath and cleanse thoroughly until the anus can be seen, and you will observe the worms.
Therefore, hang them with hooks or hold them with your nail.
Then cut them at their roots.
If however they are not held by the hooks due to their and their softness, then capture them with a rough cloth or with a stick made of double thread, and extract them with your fingers.
Then cut them and after making certain incisions on the site, apply some hot powders over them to substitute for cautery.
They should be cauterized according to what precedes in the chapter on cauterization.
Then attend to them with the rest of the treatment until they recover.
If the anus does not respond to expulsion, then treat the patient with a mild enema where there is a small bite mark, so that it will expel what is inside the anus and quickly allow for expulsion when the patient starts to expel.
If the stones are outside the anus, then their condition is light and easy: it is as if you could catch them with your finger or with a hook, and you would insert them.
Then attend to them with what we have said until they recover.
And for those who fear the operation with iron, then it is necessary to apply stitches to them according to this manner.
Take a thread and insert it into the point.
Then pull the stone upwards and make it pierce with the point at its other side into the root. And take hold of both ends of the thread below the tip of the needle, making them parallel; and pull the stone tightly shut.
Then tie the thread, and pull out the point.
Do this with all stones, and remove one from them: do not let it bleed excessively, so that it may heal from the excess of blood.
Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or aloe, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Then let him go until he falls.
When the stones then fall, attend to them with ointment and other treatments until they recover.
On the Care of Wounds.
For often this happens from the drying out of feces and the constriction of nature.
And when they dry up, and medicine no longer benefits them: then it is necessary to use roots with punctures of Spatiumilis, or with your nail, until they become moist, and the upper cortex is removed which prevents their consolidation.
Then care for them until they consolidate as required.
And if they do not consolidate: then repeat them with a more intense reason than the first, until they bleed much, and are then scraped afterwards. Care for them until they heal.
On the care of Almirmar inverted, and not inverted, as well as Athelil drying up, and Formicae.
Then care for that: and if necessary, cauterize it according to what precedes in its own chapter.
From Athelil dry ones, there is one that is a small prominent elevation, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
And it often happens on children's hands.
The treatment for it is to spread Athelil and strike it: or tie it with a silk thread, or with wool until it falls.
And if necessary, cauterize it according to what has been provided with fire or with sharp medicine: and now the reversed thorns are eradicated, both those that were turned inwards and those that were not, using the tool I will mention. And the ant is also a small filtrated prominence, thick, spreading over the body surface, penetrating deeply. And when it finds cold, it feels like an ant bite inside, and affects the entire body. And much of it happens in the hands.
And its treatment is to take a tube from the goose feather or turkey feather and place this tube on the ant until it holds a circle of the parts of it.
Then rotate your hand with the tube until you remove what is within the circle of the ant. And place it deeply into the flesh and eradicate the ant from its root. And if you wish, do this with an air or iron tube, according to this form.
Place the tube of the cannula upwards to its limit, pulling outwards until it touches the tip of your finger and the rotation of both.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was provided for cauterizing Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ About the instruments which are used for enemas in bowel disorders and for relieving the stomach, and colic.
Chapter 83.
Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or of brass, or of blown or hammered air.
And sometimes it is made from these small and large instruments according to how they are used.
Therefore, that which is administered in the care of small children or infants, let it be for small ones: and of those who are weak or painful, thus also enemas for them.
A large enema.
A small enema.
The tool he refers to, that is the upper part where it's tied around the uterus, should be wide according to this manner: and there must be distinction so that you can tie the uterus like you see it being tied. And the lower end of this which enters into the anus, should be closed off, meaning not open, soft, very much so as to pull it towards thinness: and on one side of its body are two holes, and on the other side of the body there is one hole.
And let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the tubes, and a little more thick, and let there be a uterus in which medicines are put from animal bladder: or from paper ear, which should be according to the shape of half an asphodel root: whose root will be one palm.
When placing the uterus in it, tighten it at the top with the clamps between two distinguishing constrictions strongly.
Then perform enemas with it.
And this is the form of the circle depicted here and the holes. The quality of the enema when using this is as follows: you should fill it with a medicine from the bladder or uterus, which must be heated according to the quantity that the sick can tolerate. And beware not to make it overly hot or overly cold.
Then the patient is made to lie on his back, and raises his legs to the upper side; and place under him a pad, that is, skin upon which people are lying, or a sheet.
Then immerse the extremity in a bath of turpentine mixed with oil, or with albuginea, or with fennel mucus, or something similar.
Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Then have the attendant bear him up with his two hands at the same time, and press him until he vomits completely what is in the suppository in the intestines. Then remove the suppository, and raise the patient's legs to the wall. If the medicine intends for him to pass (the contents), then hold as much as he can bear.
And if it causes sleep through that whole night, it is more beneficial for improvement.
If the suppositories cause discomforts of the belly's solution and hasten its exit: then repeat the suppositories until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or injured parts near the anus, then use suppositories very gently and mildly, using those suppositories that are used for children.
And this is to be the shape of the thin suppository on which there is tight skin.
¶ On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Head 84.
I have already spoken about the division of the treatment of wounds within the book and I will now discuss their treatment with hands and medicines according to completion.
Therefore, I say that wounds are distinguished according to how they occur and according to the place upon which they fall.
Therefore, as to the wounds produced by these many things, they are like a stone's impact: or by cutting with a sword, or a knife: or by hitting with a spear, or wood, or an arrow: and similar actions from many other objects.
Wounds that occur according to the location of the body are like a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or loins, and similar wounds from those parts.
And I am the narrator of treatments for certain wounds, to place that reasoning and rule above the rest of the wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the recall of compositions leads into the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of bone: then consider if it was due to being struck by a stone or something similar, and has only felled the skin; it is a large wound, and you should be fearful for its minor outcome with bleeding disorders. Then act quickly, apply a head phlebotomy immediately: do not delay this: extract from him according to the strength of his blood: if there is nothing prohibiting it from bloodletting, especially if the blood that flows out of the wound is very little.
And let the phlebotomy be taken from the opposite side of the wounded area.
And may the sick person beware of overfeeding himself, and of wine, and of heavy foods.
If however there is something that prohibits reduction, then reduce it from food, and do not approach meats, nor wines.
And place an hot poultice over the wound if it happens to him, soak it in rose oil or oil alone, or with wine that has astringency.
If you have safely cleared the wound of pus with a warm cautery, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and has not changed itself into air, the powder I will tell you after a little: and if it has already changed itself into air, then place on it some ointments until it heals.
If the wound is large or comes from a cut made by a tool, and similar conditions apply: if its edges do not stick together due to pus, then you should join them with stitches according to what I will describe about wounds of the abdomen regarding their stitching.
If the wound has already been found from bone and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except in a small retaining device: then cut into it.
Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore flesh to it instead of skin. And instruct the sick person to eat food that is fattening such as heads and boiled wheat until they feel full, and similar items.
If you find decomposition in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out the decomposed part completely, and remove it; then care for that.
If however there is an artery or a vein from which blood flows in these wounds: and if it cannot be severed through medicine, then enquire about the artery.
If therefore you find that it is not followed by coagulation, then cut or tie it with the help of an assistant.
If necessity prompts when it does not allow what we said to occur, then apply the cautery until blood is released.
The Method for the Surgical Treatment of Newborns.
Recipe one part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of non-extinguished bones: it should be heated much, and sifted: and it should be filled with this into the wound, and tied with a good bandage until it adheres well over it and coagulates with blood.
Then bind him from above with grains, and release him, do not break him as long as he remains, so that he does not get loose.
For the medicine shall not be removed from him until he is healed.
Then take care of the rest of the treatment until they heal.
The Treatment for Wounds to the Neck.
Chapter 85: The Head
If indeed a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment method among itself and when it is simply a head wound.
If indeed the nerve of the neck has already been cut or an artery: then if it's a nerve, there isn't any skill unless proper treatment is done with what causes strong constriction like ligatures, and zinnias, and things similar to them.
Because they harm nerves and constrict them.
And do not put anything cold absolutely on the wound: for the substance of nerves is cold and their continuation is with the brain which is higher than any member; let that be used in healing according to medical remedies gently, like plaster mixed with sweet water occasionally with oil or with rose oil, and turmeric when it is washed even with sweet water: and all other mineral stones, in accordance with this manner, and greasy ointments.
If the wound is large, then apply stitches: or constrict its edges with powders.
Then care for it until it heals.
If the depth of the wound is deep or it happens that a sinus occurs in its lower part, where pus has already accumulated, then puncture it at a more depressed place in there.
And if an artery has already been cut in the wound and there is a flow of blood from it, then separate it, or dry it out and tie it: or burn it with a cautery if necessity demands that.
And if the windpipe has already been cut, or even if it is entirely cut and the larynx has been saved, then gather together the edges of the skin with stitches above the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe itself, rather keep it in equilibrium, and place it back to its natural form.
Then tighten the bandage appropriately, and release him after several days.
Then the treatment itself, involving ointments that have a bandaging and drying quality, continues until healing occurs.
If a wound has already made an impression in the bone, then explore it. If there are fragments of bone within it, extract all of them or as many that you can from them: and leave what cannot be prepared to heal until the wound has putrefied, and its egress is separated and cleaned out.
If the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder I have described.
If it appears that the wound contains an opening into the mouth and forms a fistula, then treat that with him whose method is described in its own chapter.
Chapter 86.
If therefore wind escapes from the wound when the sick person gasps for breath, then you know that the wound is mortal.
If there is no depth to the wound and it is recent with his own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor compress it, so that the blood does not get trapped in the depths of it and return to the heart and kills him: but apply a drawing ointment to it, and let it be applied twice in a day.
But if the ointment is not available to you, then put in a used wick in the wound opening, so that it draws out what comes out of it from the moistures: and make him sleep on the wound, so that it heals what accumulates in it.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound occurred and no sickness has befallen him, nor a bad heart tremor, nor constriction during gasping, and you see his other conditions good: then you know that the wound is healing.
Therefore take care of it yourself and with permissions, and continue the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If recovery is not justified and it always opens up again, then you will know that a fistula has already been formed.
Therefore take care of it according to its own chapter.
And if there is a wound from an incision by the tool of a razor or a knife, and it is simple in the surface of the chest or back: then take care of it according to what preceded from suture, if it's large; or with powder, if it's small.
And if it has already made an imprint into the bone and comes out from there fragments: then inquire about the wound, and proceed to remove those fragments if they are separate.
If however they are not separated, then let them go, until the wound putrefies, for their extraction would cause harm.
The judgment of other injuries on different limbs in treatment is the judgment we have stated.
Section: On wounds of the belly and exit of intestines, and their expulsion.
Chapter 87.
The disruption that occurs in the belly can be large, medium, or small.
From a large one, it is sometimes expelled, or the number of intestines.
Therefore there is an insertion of them and their suture is more intense and more difficult.
And even the small disruption occurs in a more difficult manner due to another method.
Therefore, it follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten in its introduction to its place immediately: because it inflates, opens, and thickens: hence the difficulty of its introduction.
Therefore, for this reason a better disruption of the middle is done: because when that does not happen, reduction of the intestine becomes easier, unlike in those two cases.
You know that the stitching of wounds is done according to four methods.
Two common stitches apply to the abdominal wound and to other body wounds: and two other specific stitches are designed for other types of wounds.
However, they are more specific for abdominal stitches: and I will tell you each one with its explanation and demonstration. I thus say, that when the wound is small and something from the intestine protrudes out of it, making its reduction difficult; then this corresponds to one of the two methods.
Or due to the difficulty of the rupture, as we said: Or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
When this happens like that, then you need to warm it up so as to immerse the sponge, or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Or boil them in water with reeds, hyssop, and garlic, and treat the intestine with that, until the inflation resolves.
At times it performs one where there is an application of pressure, and it is better than just water alone in the resolution of inflammation.
When you see that the inflammation has already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water that has been boiled in it, or honey.
For through this method the introduction of its contents becomes smoother when there is little matter present.
If the release of its contents is then relieved after this treatment, then perform a somewhat limited disruption, using the tool used for cutting hemorrhoids.
The first form of treatment is better when prepared than cutting: and there is no enforced compulsion for a second cut after need and lack of tools.
Take one part of it which is bent and pointed, and the other part is not sharp, and do not have a thin tip like that of Spatumilis, but make it slightly钝 instead. And see as you perceive, it resembles a thorn.
So, when the wound expands and enters the intestines, then it is necessary that its reduction takes place according to its natural shape in its own place, if possible over that: for this is better.
But when the disruption is large in the lower part of the abdomen: then it should be made that the patient lies on its back, and place its legs higher than its head.
And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place its head and its body higher than its lower parts.
And similarly, if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your purpose and consideration always on this, so that the part where the wound is be higher than the other part.
And thus it should be that you administer this to large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In very small wounds, place the treatment according to what is prepared for you.
Then have a worthy attendant present between your hands who will hold the entire disruption with his hand and gather its lips.
Then remove from it for the one who follows in suture something after something, and this is the common method of suturing.
And it is that you take the point or number of points according to the size and extent of the wounds.
Then from the end of the breakage, remove an amount equal to a digit, that is, for doctors: and hold one point with which you will introduce the thread into both ends of the skin, with two ends underneath the skin from the inside, until it penetrates from another part, and you have already connected the two ends of the skin, and two ends of the other thing: and there are four orders.
Then tighten with double thread around the tip of the needle from both sides at intervals, until two wounds are aggregated in appropriate union.
Then remove the thickness of a digit again, and hold another needle point in them: afterwards draw it out with thread as you did with the first needle.
So do not stop doing that with each one from the needles until you complete the closure of all wounds.
And the needles should be of medium size between thickness and fineness: because very fine needles pierce the flesh quickly; and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin: therefore it must be that they have a medium size both in fineness and thickness.
And it should not happen that the needle gets caught very close to both ends of adjacent skin pieces; so as not to pierce the flesh quickly and open the wound before its own healing, and also not to stretch them even with suturing, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles so as not to hurt the patient during their sleep. And place them with small pieces of cloth from all sides on each end of the needle. Let them remain until you know that the wound has already healed.
And indeed, this kind of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Because for sewing them together one needle, or two, or about that number, will suffice.
The second stitch is common, so that when the two ends of a wound are gathered together, they form four: two ends of skin and two ends of suture in opposition to one another. There should be a needle with thread rolled within it, of equal thickness and size.
Next, when you have penetrated with the needle those four ends, bring the needle back from the part where you started, so that the wound-up thread falls from the upper part of the wound: as it is when they sew cloth using a needle and string, and place throughout every stitch the thickness equivalent to less than a finger.
This stitch, however, humans know.
And with this stitch I treated the wound that had happened to him on his belly, which he had received from being cut by a knife, and there was a larger disruption of the wound than one hand's width: and it protruded two hands' lengths from the intestines, from the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the center of the abdomen.
Therefore I returned that which had protruded from his wound back into his intestine after it stood outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
The wound thus healed within a space that was about fifteen days: and I treated it, and he was made well: and after that he lived many years, accustomed to his own arrangements.
And the physicians judged that it would not be healed.
And by miracle, it was what wasn't treated with the balsam.
Because I was in a place where no balm could be found, nor anything from the physicians.
So I placed on the wound twice a dried up lamb's wool each day, and did the constant washing of it with honey water until it was healed.
I will now describe two kinds of suture peculiar to the craft according to the narrative of the discourse.
And it is like this when you start with a sharp suture: and you will insert the point from the outer to the inner part.
So when the needle penetrates the skin and enters the incision according to both the length and width of the entire body: remove the end of it, let's say on the side where you inserted the point, and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inner part towards the outer part at the other extremity.
So when you make it penetrate like this at the same end towards the outer part and then to the inner: remove the end which is on that side. Then make the needle penetrate at another end from the inner part towards the outer part: and make it penetrate with the penetration you are making it penetrate in that other end, which is in its part, until it penetrates it entirely.
Then start again from this same side, and take out the needle from the skin which it has penetrated, with the end that is coming out from the other side of that part.
Then return it to that skin and take out the other end which is on another side, with this end here. Take it out from the skin which is coming out from its part, and do this in turn like this one and the other. Do this alternately until you have returned its entire outer part according to this example.
The summary of this stitch is like that for sutures of animal skins where they are leathers: thus you make the needle in turn from one part to the other end of the skin. And when you remove it alternately from one side to the other, until you finish.
The second kind of peculiar stitch, as Gale said.
This statement about his speech is narrated in order to describe how some surgeons operate on them, so they gather all parts into a suitable match by nature: and they apply the end of one side against the other part of its own kind, and the end of future against another part of it.
And this is done according to what I tell you.
You must fix the point in the nearest end to you from the outer part and make it penetrate into the inner side within that sole: and release the two ends of sifac.
Then turn the point, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner side through both ends of sifac, that is, on both sides.
Then turn both of them, and also make each penetrate from the inner to the outer side until it reaches the other ends, which are on the opposite side.
This is the better method of suture compared to the common one, and it is the suture which follows a recollection.
This, then, is the words of Galen as well.
And some said.
The abdominal suture is corrected with two needles.
This means, you will introduce each of the threads one by one: and start when inserting the needle as you have it, make that penetrate until reaching another side, according to how those are sewn which are skin on an equal level.
And you should know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than those of other parts of the abdomen.
The judgment on treatment for wounds is like the judgment for all other wounds.
What is that, because when you take up a wound with its blood, before it cools off, and you bring back the intestine, and restore itself, and make it fit: then place it on powdered flesh.
If the air has already altered the wound: then place some ointments over it, which are available to you, until pus forms: and remove the threads, and heal them with new ones, and marvel.
Then care for this as you would treat other wounds, until it heals.
If however the medicines are not available to you, then immediately place over it whatever starts to emit pus from there. Use old wadding: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
If however you fear that the wound communicates with major limbs in an injury, then it is necessary to immerse soft woolen cloth into oil at a temperate heat, or into rose oil: and place that in the area around the groin, and under the axilla.
If it feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this happens often), then cleanse it with an infusion of wine mixed with astringent herbs, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached into the intestine and made a penetrating wound up to its cavity.
And know that what comes from the larger intestine is easier to heal, and what comes from them from the finer one is more difficult to heal.
However, the intestine which is called the Jejunum does not receive healing from any wound that happens in it at all: and this is because of its abundance, consisting of veins, and their largeness, and because of its subtle body, and proximity to nerve nature.
If what proceeds from the wound is hair and you have obtained it fresh, follow this: reduce it according to your method of reducing intestines equally.
If however a period has elapsed from it and it has already turned green or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place which was discolored by it, so that no blood flow occurs.
Indeed in hair, veins and arteries are present.
Then cut the ligament that is beyond it and place two hanging ends of thread from the lower part of the wound outside it. So that when you pull on its end above, and extract it in the case of hair, there will be a discharge from the wound.
Remembrance of what happens to wounds in the intestine.
When there is a disruption in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible for some people to heal. Therefore, because I have seen someone who was wounded in their abdomen with the thrust of a lance, and had an old wound from the right side of the stomach, and he made a fistula, and excretion came out of it, along with wind.
So I took care of the treatment until I was not satisfied with his healing. I did not cease to investigate him until he was healed and the place had consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick man, that something bad might happen to him in his abdomen: and no bad events occurred to him from that.
And he remained in his better condition, eating and drinking, defecating, bathing in a bath and exercising in his diet.
And some of the experimenters said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small, then it should be tied according to this method.
And it is as if you were taking out the heads of great ants.
Then join two lips to the wounds, and place one of the ants which have an open mouth on top of the two lips.
So when he puts his head on top of it and tightens his mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not come loose.
Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with an ant after an ant according to the quantity of wounds.
Then return it back, and heal his wound.
For the heads remain attached inside until he eats the intestines and is healed, and no harm befalls the sick person completely. And it is possible that the intestine can be tied even with a fine thread: which is taken from the animal's intestine and attached to it after being inserted into the needle.
And you will take this end of the thread from the intestine, and much flesh will be removed.
Then tie a fine, rolled linen thread at its end.
Then insert that thread into the needle, and heal with it the intestine.
Then return it to the disruption. And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is nothing other than according to the path of trust and hope.
You know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines: then there is no skill other than delicacy, and there is not its complete healing.
¶ On the care of Zuchemen (Zucchemen) and Fistulas.
Chapter LVIII.
You should know that every sore, or pustule when it matures and becomes old, and turns into a ulcer, and does not heal, and always exudes pus, and is not removed: then it is universally called a fistula in any member wherever it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
And indeed, a fistula is according to truth, a filtered nodation, hard, white: with which there is no pain, and it has the shape of a bird's feather: for that reason some people call it Risati, that is, a bird.
And there are certain times when it becomes wet, which exudes pus.
And perhaps the moisture splits or divides at certain times.
And this moisture can be abundant, and scarce: it can be coarse, or it can be fine.
And I have already stated in the division that when I said wounds, every ulcer which does not heal and is not born within the flesh, this is not because of just one of nine causes.
One of these causes is, either because there is little blood in the body: or due to its malice: or because between him and above his lips there is hard flesh which prevents birth of tissue: or because there are many sores and pus: or because the ulcer itself is putrid and what is sent to it has bad quality: or because medicine is inconvenient in treating it: or because decay falls into a region, which is a plague like happening in Caesarea: where difficult digestion of sicknesses occurs and healing of pustules is delayed by nature: or because there is one mouth or number of bones.
And I have already shown all of these causes and their signs, and the treatments with medicines in the division. And it should be noted here that you need to understand how to treat a fistula and Zuchen which happens through an operative procedure with hands.
Therefore, you should know that a fistula may occur in all parts of the body.
Therefore, there are fistulas which reach to the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinuses: or to the intestines, or bladder, or some part of the ribs: or to some part of the thoracic vertebrae, or to some part of a compound structure made up of joints: such as the hands, and feet: and among these are those which tend towards the neighborhood of the main member, and their like.
Therefore, among these fistulas, this one follows this manner: it is from ailments which are difficult to heal and do not accept treatment, and when there is an occupation with that, the effort and ignorance are present.
And if it is from some fistulas whose depth does not reach the places that I said: and you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to come to know about it, then take a trial with air or iron, if the fistula extends according to rectitude, and seek it out along with it.
And if there is tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with an attempt using fine lead.
Because lead, due to its softness, is absorbed by the body and conforms around the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to describe it with a trial.
So cleanse from there an opening from its own openings.
For the moisture with which you cleanse it, directs the flow of other openings and flows out from them.
Then carefully inquire according to the manner that is possible for you: so you may know whether there is a hole or nerve, and whether it is the concavity of the fistula far away or near. Or if there is one fistula with many openings and you stand over all this with your utmost strength: through your questioning about the sick person, and the discovery of pain upon compression on that place by your hand, and similar interpretations and causes of such events.
When therefore you stand on all that true station, then go to treatment according to confidence: and it is that you should consider then if a Fistula appears near, or in a place saved remotely from the junction, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of those places which I told you about; then cut the Fistula according to what has been given as instruction from my narrative, and take out whatever is in it from filtration, and rotten flesh, which is born in its opening from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and care for that until it heals.
If the Fistula is remote and deep, and follows straightness: then it must be cut within as far as possible to you.
Then cleanse that from all its rotten flesh.
Then administer licorice that is rolled up in the medicines of the acute: and insert them until you reach the hollowed-out part of the fistula which you comprehended with iron: do it with these things repeatedly, until the medicine of the acuteness corrodes completely all that remains in the hollow part of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore her with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until she is healed.
If however it does not heal through this, then burn her according to what we have told.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is the mouth, and it is confirmed to you thus: then inquire about it, and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing prevents you from anything through a vein, or nerve, or main member, as we said.
If therefore the mouth is discovered to you, and there is something of corruption and darkness within it: then shave it off until the entirety of its corruption is removed.
Then care for it together with what has been grafted onto it until it is healed.
If it does not heal and discharges pus as before, then you will know that your complete eradication of the corruption has not been achieved.
So clean it off with something else secondly, and examine it closely, and complete its purification with your final strength.
Then restore it.
If it then heals, that is good; and if not, then you will know that that corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you do not have the ability for it in such matters, unless to let nature itself dispose of it.
If the affected area is the mouth that is too small and it is possible for you, draw it in with fine forceps that are suitable for this task.
If there are many bones though, then you should examine the attraction of all of them carefully, and do not let anything go from them with your strength.
If something from the moisture opposes you and there is no fear or mistake about making an incision on them: then cut out those moist substances and flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
If however there is no preparation for removing bones from your time, then place over the wound that which will rot it: and remove it until the decomposition reaches what is within the circumference of those bones in flesh and moisture.
And guard the wound so that it does not harden.
And bind the section you made during your operation.
Instead, put over it (the wound), if you fear, sulfur ground and mixed with oil: or the tip submerged in an Egyptian ointment, or any green ointments.
For when those putrid humors do exist and separate from them bones, their removal should be performed and also the attraction of these.
And if there is a large mouth like the thigh hole or the hip joint and similar things, and what has decayed from it is a large part of it: then shave it until the final reason, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Then heal the wound.
And if what has decayed in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to file it down completely until one reaches the point where the corruption arrived. Then take care of it until it heals. And I will tell you about what happens to the patient in his leg: use it as an example and a guide for your operation.
There was a young man about thirty years old, who experienced pain in his leg. This occurred due to the movement within him inside the body, that is, from the interior parts, up until the material reached the knee, and an abscess formed: and it was not an external cause.
Therefore, time has extended with the error of the doctors until the abscess opens, and there is a large amount of matter coming together with it.
And after the treatment until the knee becomes a tunnel, and many holes are made in it: all of which were emitting pus and bodily humors.
Therefore, a multitude of doctors treated him for about two years, and there was no skillful person in the art until I was called and saw his knee and the large flow coming out of those holes; indeed, all his body had already turned yellow, and his color was pale.
Therefore, an attempt at introduction is made in one place of the openings, and the attempt reached the mouth.
Then I thoroughly examined all openings; and found them to come to each other from all parts of the leg. Therefore, I proceeded, and followed through one of those openings until I found the part of the bone; and I found it decayed: which was already corroded, had decayed, stunk, and perforated, until it penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore, I chiseled what was found to me, and prepared from the decayed bone.
And I placed it, that which was not part of the bone but that decay, which I chiseled and removed.
And I had already uprooted that.
Then, I placed the restoration with lengthwise consolidated medicines to heal the wounds.
And it has not been consolidated.
Then, I attempted to restore it.
And it has not been restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed. There was no need for this repetition of the operation and section on him, except due to his debilitated condition, limited tolerance, and fear for his life: since he experienced maladies from excessive urination fits at all times.
The healing is therefore complete healing: and the wound is formed at the site of the bone's flesh, and good arrangement has been made within its body, and his strength returns: and he has adapted to his conditions: and it did not cause him any harm in walking; entirely no damage.
If the elevated mouth in the place of the body is already broken: then it must be that you sew it, according to this manner: and it is: take the ligament, and tighten it at the end of the projecting bone: and command someone, who extends it upwards: and put another ligament made of thicker wool thread on the first one. Then sew it over the flesh which is at the mouth of the bone: and extend its end so that you take flesh downwards: and you lay flesh over the place where you wish to saw, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Place wood or a slab beneath the bone below: because when you do this, it is not prevented that it dries out the corrupted flesh.
And it must be that the saw is over the place of corruption just enough, so that there is not a depression due to the corruption in the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance by sense, and compels it through her means instead of others towards the use of her own saw. If the mouth is corrupted and is not elevated, rather a part of it continues with its part: and corruption is in the middle of it, or in a part of itself: then take flesh from all parts completely.
Then place wood below.
Then saw that from the first part where there is corruption until it continues on the other side. And make the sawing according to the length near the corruption as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut off that damaged joint and saw through where it continues on the other side of the mouth.
If there is corruption in the continuity of two ligatures, then there is no ingenuity except for abrasion.
If corruption is found in the fingers' ligature or in the ligature of the foot: then it is very difficult to deal with that.
But you must inquire how the corruption appears to you.
And remove the abrasion, and cleanse it according to any possible arrangement for you, and correct it with whatever ingenuity suits you: when it does not oppose you against the vein, or nerve.
And you will know that the incisors and saws are needed for these bones in large amounts, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their fineness, their size, their smoothness, their hardness, and their rarity.
Therefore, it is necessary to prepare the appropriate tool for each type of operation suitable for that operation.
And you will know that these operations indicate to you the type of tool you need for them when your study is extensive.
And knowledge of the methods of this art is evidence of the severity of its methods: then you will indeed find for yourself what suits it from the tools to all illnesses.
The form of the saw.
The form of another saw.
The form of yet another saw.
The form of another saw.
This depiction of the saw's form, let it be correctly made. Make it an upper arch, its sharpness from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and let it be pyramidal asymmetrically made.
The form of the razor for joints.
Let the head of this razor have the shape of a star-shaped nail: and let its points be according to the shape of the points of an escutcheon.
And it is not suitable unless they rub against its heads when the joints are corrupted, or against a wide and large mouth.
The form of the larger razor.
The form of the medium-sized razor.
The form of the wide-bladed razor.
The form of the razor that has a concavity.
The form of another thin razor.
The form of the other razor with curved extremities.
The form of the leaf-shaped razor, finely pointed.
The form of the razor used for cutting bones.
Also, the large razor's form.
This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw: it is exhibited in many places according to the reason of bones.
The form of the razor that conforms to its ratio which is perforated from bones.
Its end is triangular, and it has sharp extremities.
It is made from India.
And similarly, it should be that all things which we said about razors, cutters, and saws are made.
Section on making cuts to extremities, and the locking of bones.
Chapter 89.
The extremities decompose, either from an external cause or from an internal one.
So when you have treated that corruption with medical remedies, and the treatment does not agree: and you see corruption occurring in a member, which is unaffected by anything: then it must be that you proceed to that member until where the consequence of corruption follows, so that the sick person may escape death through this, or from malice which is greater than the defect of the member.
And the sign that this occurs is when the member deteriorates until it seems like it; which was burned by fire or rotted after becoming black: until that corruption spreads to that which follows that member and weaves its way through the entire body.
Therefore, when it comes to cutting into that [affected] part, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from striking by some venomous creatures: such as sea scorpions, snakes, vipers, and similar.
So if the corruption, or striking, is in the end of a finger, then cut the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption, so it will proceed up to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut that from the root of the palm, and do not leave space for the corruption, until it reaches into the palm of the arm.
And if it invades there, then cut the arm at its elbow joint. And if the corruption passes through and you see it around the elbow: then there is death for the sick person.
And to administer beyond that with healing, is the quantity of strength.
And similarly do this with a foot, when corruption invades a toe, then cut it at the joint of one. And if it reaches up to the heel bone, then cut the whole foot.
If it ascends to the knee, then at the joint of the leg you will cut.
If corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no art in that case, except for discharge and leave the disabled to death.
And the method of applying or gripping the limb, or tightening it, is to tighten the ligament below where you wish to apply: and then tighten another ligament above that place.
And let the assistant extend one ligament downwards: and let the other assistant extend another ligament upwards.
And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is revealed.
Then cut or tighten it.
And it must be that you lay the linen cloth on from all parts and does not touch the healthy area with the scalpel: and let there be a wound added to the sick person, and apply a hot poultice.
If however there should occur an internal flow of blood while you are operating, then quickly cauterize the area: or place some blood-letting powders on it.
Then return to your treatment until completion.
Then join the wounded limb with the corresponding ligament and care for it until it heals.
And I will tell you what happens to him in his foot, this is the same event that I am telling you about.
What happens is that a blackness occurs in his foot, akin to the effect of burning by fire: and this corruption first happens in his toe until it spread throughout his entire foot.
He treated himself therefore after he saw the corruption advancing into his limb with the decay of him, which he found from his pain and burning: and it affected him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time has passed for him, the same decay occurs in his index finger of his own hand. So he came to me, and I tried to restore that excess with what I had placed over his hand after applying medicines for the purification of his body: the excess did not return, but began to spread to another finger; until decay started to occur on his hand.
He therefore called me to cut his hand: but I did not agree to that, hoping for a response from him about the return of that excess; and I was also afraid that he might die at the cut of his hand.
Because the strength of the man was above the situation.
So when he had given up hope of me, he returned to his land: and news reached me from him because it was close, and he cut off his entire hand: and he was cured.
And I did not omit this narrative, except as an aid to understanding what falls under this type of illness, and as a representation by which it is understood, and according to which it is handled.
Section on the care of sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Title 90.
When an abscess occurs in some fatty parts of the body and stretches out its space until it forms pus: then when it is drained or punctured, and what was inside comes out from the pus, leaving a vacuous place as if there were a container: and the skin above it behaves like a woven fabric that has now been finely woven. It does not proceed to the final stage of corruption, nor spreads into the mouth, nor into the nerves, nor into the ligaments. It deserves to be named Sinus: but is not called Fistula. However, if its space stretches out until it spreads the corruption into one of these membranes, then it is named as Fistula or zuken.
And its treatment is for you to cut that skin completely as it would be peeled off: and especially when it has been made thin like a cloth; and trust that it won't adhere with the place because of its decomposition.
If you hope it will adhere to the skin and does not follow that final corruption: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then take care with Clister: and it is what you should consider towards the Breast.
Then if it is large and the pus that flows from it has a foul odor: then use clister with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinnia, taking equal parts, they are mixed together in a pot: and they are boiled over fire until the medicine turns red: and it becomes like honey in thickness.
Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and use the clister with it on the Breast: and tighten its opening, and release the medicine into it up to the amount of two hours.
Then extract it with expression: do this for days until the Breast is cleansed, and remove the smell.
And sometimes you can use clister with ashes water when this medicine is not available to you: and it is that you take the ash of vine wood or the ash from oak woods: and place the water on it.
Then heat her up, and use the clister with it until you're sure that the Breast has been cleaned.
If the weak cannot bear the Egyptian medicine or the ashes water, then use the clister with water and honey, which already has a little of ground zinnia mixed in.
Or use the clister with honey and wine mixed, because of the properties of honey it cleanses and washes away: and wine makes the Breast adhere, especially when there is excess of coagulation and drying in the wine.
When you do this repeatedly, and you trust that the corruption sinus is already removed: then irrigate him with what causes flesh to be born in it.
And this is how you receive it from the plaster of dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil, and wine that is tight-stoppered: or irrigate it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I wrote about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the Sinus orifice is narrow and doesn't accept the tube of the enema, then widen it with iron gently: or place a rolled piece of linnen in it coated with Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment, until it gets wider.
And similarly, if the orifice is even wide, then gather its lips together with suture: and extract from it an amount that can accept enema without addition.
And similarly, if the orifice from which pus flows is elevated above the rest, then dry it in a lower place within it so that it can drain pus down to below. Because when pus is constrained deep inside the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus somewhat below its level as you wish: then try preparing the limb with a preparation that facilitates the drainage of pus from it, according to how you are prepared.
Try to ensure nothing is retained within it from the pus at all: and take the consolidating medicines that are placed above the sign, compatible with what you desire.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a size that it can communicate with all of the sinus.
And then cut into the direct opening of the sinus hole with forceps, more than the sinus opening gently.
Then, extend from the ointment strips onto the cloth another one, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it in a long position away from the sinus opening, so that pus can exit through it: and do not remove the large piece of cloth until after a few days once.
That one which is over the Sinus opening, that one you remove at all times to see what comes out from it due to pus. And by this means you will know whether that which flows out of it is much or little; whether it's well digested or undigested.
And after this, again examine the location of the Sinus, whether the owner feels pain in it or there is no pain, and whether there is a boil in it or there is no boil.
Therefore, when your treatment is applied like this, and you see the substance coming out over the Sinus opening, then you will know that the Sinus has already adhered, or is approaching adherence. Therefore, then resolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you resolve the wound, then change another piece of cloth, and renew the ointment. If however pus comes out from the Sinus over a long space finely, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching. For there are people among humans who delay the growth of flesh in their wounds, and from them come those who act contrary to him.
If however pus that is undigested comes out from the Sinus over many days, then you will know that the Sinus does not adhere.
If thus adherence of the Sinus is delayed and prolongs its course: then add to drying medicines, but let the doctors do this such that the medicine itself becomes wet in its substance and dry in its power: like the unguent of dyafinicon, when an excess addition is added to it from zegi.
And from this final part of what is treated, it is that you take the unguentum dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and let wine of old age be applied to its substance.
Then mix that with it, and use it.
And similarly performs this operation when you do not have the presence of dyafinicon ointment, honey, when you decoct it until it thickens and uses it.
Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind all of it together, and spread the ground substance over honey while it is on fire.
Then pour it over the substance, and bind it on the skin: and pour over it the honey that you have decocted, until it thickens: then grind the mixture and spread it over the substance, and place a piece of cloth over it and bind it.
And sometimes it is administered with long aristolochia and the roots of celestial lily, and there is the lily: and herb flour, and centaury.
Use them in their simples or combined forms, grind these and sift them: and spread the ground substance over the honey that I have mentioned, and use it.
If the condition of the Sinus extends and is not cured by this method, then you will know that there is a deep corruption within it. Or perhaps it has caused an impression in the bones or other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat it with the methods for Fistular (a type of surgical procedure), as was previously stated. ### On the treatment of Panaritis (a type of inflammation), and rubbing of nails, and insertion into a finger, and cutting.
Chapter 91.
Panaritis is an abscess that develops under the thumb nail or foot toe nail, and perhaps it may develop in other fingers.
When thus the condition of his thing extends, and care for its treatment is neglected, and it's treated with an application of heat: or if it gets spoiled, and pus is emitted, until the root of the nail rots: and perhaps it spoils her completely, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the mouth until there becomes a foul smell in him: then the end of the finger broadens, and its color becomes dark.
When then you care for it, when we mentioned this in division and your care does not match up with that: then one must strike through completely with the iron what has remained of the excess from the nail.
Then after this, cauterize the wound.
Indeed, an iron cauterizer is very useful.
If however the bone is healthy, and there is even a nail intact, and the hollow parts of the nail are already pressing into the flesh towards the inside, and begin to sting it and hurt it: then you must place a fine piece of iron under the angle of the nail which stings the flesh, and push it up. Then cut that flesh with ease, and place what remains of the burned flesh from the medicaments over it until it is all removed.
Then take care of that with ointments until it heals.
If corruption has already spread into the mouth, then you must cut that mouth and remove it; for a rotten mouth never heals.
If you see corrosion and decay advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to what was previously mentioned as a reminder.
Then take care of it until it heals.
If it happens by scratching of the nail or impact: and there is a pain intermittently, then one must use a weak bloodletting first.
Then cut the nail with a sharp Spatulum instrument crossing from top to bottom.
And take care, so that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the patient through this and it will be a cause of an increased amount of flesh growing in that spot.
Then take care of the site with what soothes pains.
But the finger that grows in some human hands may be entirely fleshly. Perhaps there are bones in some of them. And perhaps there is a nail in it. Some of them grow at the junction root or its natality may be in certain joints of fingers.
The one that is born at certain joints of the finger does not move: and the one that emerges near the junction of the finger may perhaps move.
Thus, for the one among them that is fleshly, its cutting is easy.
This means: so when you encounter it at its root with the broad Spatulum tool.
The treatment for which arises in the junction's root, is difficult.
So refrain from cutting it.
In the one that grows at the end of the joints in the finger, then you must cut into the first flesh with a round incision up to the mouth.
Then scrape the opening with one of those small scraping tools suitable for that task.
Then take care of it until it heals.
Recovery that happens between digits one by one occurs multiple times either from the birth of man, meaning it is born with him, or from the healing of wounds, or from burning by fire and similar incidents.
Therefore it must be that separation of this consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Then place between them lice or cloths soaked in rose oil; so that they do not congeal quickly and separate them. Or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the affected area has consolidated according to what is required.
Similarly, if there is consolidation involving some fingers with the palm, then dry off that consolidation according to how it is prepared and suits the figure of the member.
### On Cutting [Surgery]
Title XCII.
There are numerous veins that are involved, large, full of superfluities of melancholy which occur in many parts of the body: and most of their events are in the legs, particularly in the legs of those walking, working, and bearing load.
Therefore, it is necessary that you perform the body's bleeding from black bile with strong bleeding on occasion.
Then use the phlebotomy on the patient for this basilic vein.
However, the treatment of these with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is, let it be taken up, and the black blood be extracted.
And the other method is to remove the vein, and extract all of it.
However, its section is according to this manner.
First immerse the leg up to the knee with warm water for quite some time until the thick and fatty blood resolves.
Then tighten the leg at the upper part of its thigh towards the lower part of the knee with the aid of a bandage.
Then cut the vein at one, two, or three wide sections.
Then cut the nail up to the bottom: until an amount of blood that you see is sufficient and which the strength of the patient can bear has flowed out.
Then tie that part: and instruct him not to eat anything that generates black bile. And repeat the evacuations and phlebotomy when the veins are filled up and it is harmful for the patient.
The elevation of it is according to this manner.
Wound the inside of the weak knee, if there are many hairs there.
Then introduce this into the bath: or immerse it in his legs with warm water until the veins redden and swell. Or, if there is no present bath, exercise him with vigorous activity until the member warms up.
Next, remove the skin directly along the line of the vein by cutting longitudinally: or at its last part near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Next, open the skin with pincers, and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears to your senses: and at its appearance you will see that it reddens as it darkens.
When the vein thus runs out through the skin, you will see it white as if it were a chord.
Then introduce the probe under it until when it elevates and emerges from the skin: hang it with a blind, gentle hook.
Next, cut another section close to that section with three fingers.
Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Next, elevate it with the probes as you did before, and hang it with another hook as you did first.
Next, cut another section or more sections if you need them.
Then elevate it and with the last section, cut into it at the heel.
Next, remove it up to the section that is above it.
And do that until you extract it from the upper section or with all higher sections until when it completely emerges: then cut it.
If it does not obey you to extract or elevate it, then insert a sharp needle with a strong double thread and tie it, and pull it out. Or if that fails, insert the rod beneath it, and move your hand over all parts until it goes out.
And be cautious, so as not to penetrate too far.
For if you do penetrate too far, it will make the extraction of that thing very difficult for you, and it causes damage to the weak one from there.
So when you have extracted it completely: then place over the wound a piece of cloth soaked in wine and rose oil, or just oil, and take care of it until it heals.
And if it's contracted, having a twist causing inversion to parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then you must fix over it to all parts of its twistiness, and the sites of that inversion.
Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it completely: and be cautious near your section line not to pierce or wound her, for it will become difficult for you either to lift or extract it.
So keep your caution.
The Form of the Incident on Healing Vine.
The Form of the Blind Knot.
It is not treated in the same way as other knots, nor does it have a sharp end that could pierce blood vessels: and it has a large bending, being soft. Because if it were fine, the vessel would be pierced by its thinness; indeed, it has superfluous bulkiness, as we said.
On the Extraction of the Calf Vein. Chapter 93.
This vein is generated in the limbs on warm lands, such as Alzagi, and the land of Arabs, and on dry, warm, thinly fertile lands; that is, those in which no grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it might be generated in other parts of the body besides the limbs.
Indeed, its generation is from corruption that happens under the skin, just like it happens within snakes and roundworms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of this vein's outcome is that inflammation suddenly occurs in the limbs.
Then, the area gets filled with pus.
Then, the vein begins to emerge from that area of pus, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When therefore the end of it appears from that, then you must suspend over it a piece of lead of which the weight is equivalent to half a Keil-drachma, up to two drachmas and mark this point: and remove the suspended lead from the limb.
Whenever therefore something comes out of it to the external part, mark that on lead and make a mark for this.
If it extends greatly, then cut off its part and mark the remainder.
And do not cut into it deeply before all of it has come out.
For if you cut too deeply, it will contract and penetrate into the flesh. And this causes a boil to occur and decay in the area, leading to an evil ulcer.
Therefore, it must be handled gently and extracted gradually until the very end of it comes out, so that nothing remains from it in the body: and this particular vein extends to a length of five palms and ten in some people.
And now it reaches me, for a man's discharge is from twenty palms.
And if you happen to be struck during your time of medication: then insert the needle into its opening and puncture it through that opening longitudinally, together with the body, until everything from the material inside is evacuated: and apply putrefaction treatment at the site along with medicines for a few days. And then attend to the treatment of blisters afterwards.
And this vein often has many branches, particularly when it appears at the ankle joint, or within the foot itself: and it has many openings, and a branch comes out from every opening.
So treat that part as we have said in the division, and together with what was already mentioned.
¶ Concerning the removal of worms generated under the skin, it is called Boil Agitation.
Chapter 94.
This condition is called the Boil Agitation in a certain region among us: because it happens frequently to oxen, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
And it travels throughout the body, rising and falling: and it becomes evident to perception during its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks wherever it breaks into skin, and comes out.
And its production is from the pus of some body fluids.
Just like how worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and hookworms, occur in the intestines.
And it is feared because of its maleficence.
Because when it travels through the body and rises to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens in him and comes out, and destroys an eye: and this happens frequently.
When then you wish to treat him and extract it, this is done only at his walking, and manifestation to his sense.
So it is necessary that you tie what is above him and what is below with a strong bandage together.
Then dry over it, and extract it.
If it goes deep into the flesh and you do not find it: then put a cauterizing iron over the place until it dies.
And what is feared as greater is its corruption that spoils his eye, as we said. And if you see that it has already penetrated to the head near the eye, then bind below it a good eyebrow constriction.
Then dry over it and extract it.
And it is necessary to use the sick purification of his body with medicines that dissolve bad putrid fluids.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
Section regarding the sickness of Nakir.
Chapter XC (Ninety).
This sickness is called Nakir in our land: and it is pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from one limb to another.
And indeed I have seen this myself, as I tell you.
I was called to attend a woman who is sick in some areas.
And she showed me her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein of the arm.
And after I stayed there for an hour, I saw one swelling move with a stick, like a worm moving, ascending to her shoulder faster than it can be: as silver liquid when it runs from one place to another.
The pain therefore leaves that place and settles in the shoulder.
Then sit for an hour, and run throughout the rest of the body, until it reaches another part of the arm.
He then told me that he was revolving within his entire body, as I had seen.
I was therefore amazed by the speed of its permutation from limb to limb.
And indeed, before this, I had not seen this illness so much by my eyes in such a manner.
However, I have seen many who find pain to be changing from one limb to another: and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think that this is other than due to the fact that she was one of those from whom dry body veins are detected: hence it appears, by sense, that that windiness has been changed.
And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delightful and have moist bodies, whose veins are hidden.
When therefore you seek to cure his illness, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is visible to you as we said, then bind above it, and below it quickly: and cut above it, until that constricted windiness escapes: and cauterize the area.
If however you do not see it with your eyes: then attend to it along with the removal of the body, and that which drives away winds, and smother these with stinking pills, and pills made from serpentine, and similar things.
¶ On the Extraction of Arrows.
Title XCVI. Arrows are differentiated according to their types and the locations from which they fall out of the body.
Their variety is as follows: among them are those that have large points and small ones; concave ones, and blunt-tipped ones.
And among them are those that have three angles.
And among them are those which have tongues.
And among them are those which have stars.
Those that fall according to the parts of the body where they hit are divided into two ways.
Or, the limbs are from the main body parts which are concave, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
So when it falls into any of these body parts and you see the signs of death that I tell you about later, then you should know how to extract that arrow from them, for death follows it wherever it is found, in many dispositions.
And when you do not see these bad signs and the arrow is not hidden deeply within the member, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
From the signs when an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the mouth, and emerges through the siphon above the brain, are: for accidents often happen from that such as fever, blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, cramps, confusion, and vomiting bile.
And perhaps blood may come out through the nose or ears.
And perhaps speech may be lost, and the voice destroyed.
And from the place of wounds, a white moisture is discharged resembling cream.
And there issues forth something similar to bodily moisture.
If therefore you perceive these signs, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: it is close to the left nipple; and feels as if it is stuck firmly in something hard, not in a hollow.
And perhaps the movement of an arrow is like the movement of a pulse: and it flows out of the wound black blood.
And this follows, the coldness of extremities, and cold perspiration, and intermittent fever.
So you know that death is certain to occur.
And the sign of an arrow when it pierces the lung is the discharge of foamy blood from the wound: and the symptoms that follow are choking, and the complexion changes to that of a sick person.
And he breathes out a large amount of air, high up: and he seeks the attraction of cold air.
And if the arrow falls into the pleura, which is in the chest: then it's near to the thin ribs: and there is a great gasping breath with intense pain, with sighing: and all the shoulder joints move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will be discharged from the wound with food.
And if the arrow falls into the abdomen and is stuck there: something like feces or a wad, or an intestine that has already been ruptured will be discharged from the wound.
There is therefore no hope for his treatment, nor for extracting the arrow.
If an arrow falls into the bladder and urine flows out: and something proceeds from it to the external parts, and makes the pain greater than the weakness: then you will know that it is fatal.
The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, spatula (a term used for parts of the body), assistant bones, vertebrae, forks (possibly referring to anatomical structures like joints or ligaments), thigh and similar parts are diagnosed according to multiple dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery, or a nerve: and there is no poisonous arrow.
And I will tell you what I have seen about these arrows, so that you may understand through this in regard to your treatment.
This is because some men, an arrow has fallen into the lacrimal sac of their eye, and at the base of their nose.
So extract it yourself from the other side, under the skin of his ear: and he will be healed, and nothing harmful happens to him in his eye.
And he extracted another arrow for the Jew, which fell into the fatty tissue of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not find anything from it except a small part of its tip, with which it sticks to his own wood: and this arrow was large among arrows from the Turcoman bows, made of soft iron, in which there are no ears.
So the Jew was healed, and nothing harmful befalls his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of the Christian.
And it was an Arab arrow, and that is the kind which has ears.
So I followed it between two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat.
I have skillfully extracted her with care until she was freed: and the Christian is healed.
And I extracted another arrow from him which had penetrated into his abdomen: and we thought he would die from it.
So after thirty days had passed for him and nothing changed from his condition according to his dispositions, I pursued the arrow: and I devised a plan over it, then extracted it: and he was healed, and no harm befell him afterwards.
And I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and a scar was formed over it.
And after seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her abdomen, and a scar was formed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and nothing changed from her condition according to her dispositions, and the woman did not find any harm in herself with any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man, to whom an arrow had fallen into his face: and the scar became consolidated, and remained, not finding much pain from it: and similar things happened many times.
And I extracted the arrow from the King's official, which had fallen into the middle of his nose and was already moving towards the right side slightly: and the arrow was completely hidden.
I was therefore called to treat him after the case of the arrow up until three days.
I found the scar from the arrow to be tightly bound.
I examined it carefully with a gentle touch and did not feel anything. Indeed, he himself was experiencing pain under his ear from the right side.
Therefore, I hoped that that point was from the extremity of the arrow.
Therefore, I plastered the place with a plaster containing a magnetizing and digestive property, trusting that the spot would be treated, and a sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut above it: and no accident occurred in the place indicating that the arrow had followed the spot.
So I diligently treated it with plaster for many days: and no incidents occurred, and the wound hardened in the meantime: and it remained ill from its removal for a space of days, until he felt an arrow on a certain day within his own nose.
And he told me this.
So I applied for many days an acute, corrosive medicine to it, until it opened: and when I tried it again, and felt a subtle point of the arrow adhering inside the wood.
Then I added to the incision with that acute medicine until we could clearly see the tip of the arrow. And it took me about four months to complete this process.
Then after the wound had enlarged and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move them without compliance towards exit: then I didn't stop using skill and devise methods with mechanical devices until that certain day when forceps were made at an appropriate size, according to their shape reaching the tip of the head, when I was able to extract it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed doctors judge that the nasal cartilage is not restored.
So I restored it, and the wound hardened and was healed with complete health; nothing at all harmed it.
And I tell you about the quality of extraction of certain arrows: that you might place this rule and explanation above what I have not said.
Since the parts of this craft and distinctions of them are not included with its narration: nor does this book include that, and a skilled artisan compares it with little to many: and with what is present, above that which is absent: and he discovers a new operation, and a new tool among descending phenomena of this craft when they happen.
Therefore I say that arrows do not leave the parts to which they are attached, except according to two ways. Or through attraction from the place where it entered.
Or against the other side of the part.
And that which leaves from where it entered, whether it is the arrow proceeding in a fleshly place: and it is drawn and leaves.
And if it does not conform to the exit from the time when it falls: then you must let it go for a few days, until the flesh around it decomposes. And his attraction will be relieved, and its departure.
And similarly if it is stuck in bone and does not comply with your exit, then let it go for a few days as well. And try it every day with its attraction and movement until it leaves.
And if it does not comply with you for exit after days, then you must bore around the area of the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine drill until the arrow expands.
Then draw her and extract her.
If however the arrow is fixed in the head bone, and has already proceeded into one of the brain cavities, and shows certain symptoms that I mentioned; then refrain from the attraction of the arrow, and let it go until its condition equates to this after days.
For if the arrow has reached the lung, then death does not prolong itself for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, unless within bones of the body only and does not penetrate to the lung: and he remains sick for a few days, and nothing happens to him from those events: then his abilities are tested by the action of the arrow and its removal.
And if it is deeply fixed and does not obey you to your attempt of removal: then administer arrows around the area of the arrow as I instructed you: afterwards take care of the wound until he is healed.
And if the arrow has already been removed from the body and hidden from sight: then seek it out with your attempts.
And if you feel it, then draw it out with certain tools that suit its removal.
And if you cannot reach it over it due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no opening, or nerve, or vein there: then wait until the wound enlarges and becomes possible for extracting the arrow.
And if there are ears that hold it, then free the fixed flesh in them from all sides using every tool you can and any means possible. If this is not possible without causing an issue with the movement of flesh during fragmentation of the ears or twisting of them until it becomes manageable.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any place, then use the twisting motion of your hand with forceps to all parts until it is made to come out: and using the most subtle method possible so that the arrow is not broken, making its removal difficult both for you and by you.
And if you cannot remove it in one attempt, then let it be for a few days until what is around it decomposes.
Then repeat this: if the operation eases the ailment. But if the blood flow contradicts you, then administer what we said from treatment in his chapter: and keep your strength away from the cut of a vein, or nerve, or chord.
And administer the skill in every way possible that helps you aim the arrow: and let it be with ease, and calmness, or slow speed, and strength, as I told you.
And you must do when pulling the arrow as it is weak according to the figure, according to how it was with the case of the arrow itself.
Because it is more beneficial.
But if it is not possible for you to do that, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
And the arrow that emerges from the opposite part of the other side, or begins to move towards it something on the outside: or creates a protuberance at the tip of the arrow through sensation from the upper part of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: cut it above it, and make the cut according to the amount that can be taken with the forceps.
Then pull it: for indeed it becomes easy for removal.
But if it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow imprints in the bone and expands for itself: then pull it.
And if not: let her go for days: then repeat this until she emerges.
And if the arrowwood is in it, then push it with her.
But if the wood falls and you are unable to administer a push: then insert that tool into it until its concavity enters into the tip of the arrow. Then push her with him.
If the arrow is concave, then push it with the tool entering into it.
The sagitta is understood through that.
If the arrow is poisoned, then you must, if possible, hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is: if that is within your capability.
Then take care of it according to what is suitable for this matter.
If the arrow falls in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or on the side, and it touches close to what you touch with your probe, and cutting it off is possible for you: then cut it, and remove from the incision of the vein, or nerve, and pull out the arrow.
Then heal the wound if you see it, and take care of that until it is healed.
And this is the form of pincers used to extract arrows.
Their ends are similar to the beak of a bird, which is made like iron: when they grasp over the arrow, they do not let it go.
Many kinds of them are made, large and small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its sharpness, and the depth of the wound, and the constriction around it.
The form of the impelling tool which is concave.
And the form of the impelling tool for the deaf.
This is like the end of a staff for a deaf person, so that it can be inserted into the concave arrow and pushed along with it.
The end of the tool for pushing concave arrows is like a feather, so that it can be inserted into the arrow and pushed forward.
On Bloodletting Through Veins.
Head 97. For bloodletting through veins, which is practiced within the body, there are thirty.
Of which in the head are sixteen: two jugular veins which are behind the ears and are called 'the twos'; and two arteries that become apparent at the two temporal points; and two veins which are at the two nasal lacrimal points of both eyes, they are called 'the observers'; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and a vein which is at the extremity of the nose.
And two Guidages, which are in the neck.
And two veins that are in the upper lip.
And two veins that are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins which are used for bloodletting in the arms are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic vein, and it comes from the side of the axilla: and they call this common the head vein.
And the Dark One.
And the Middle vein, and it is composed of the Basilica branch and the Cephalic branch: and they call this common the body vein.
And the Basilica vein, and it is placed in the inner side: and it is also called Tinnitus.
And they call this common the belly vein.
And the Brachial cord, and it is placed above the elbow: that is the one where bloodletting takes place, and that is the one which appears above the thumb in an obvious manner.
And the Saluatella: and it is a vein that is between the ring and the smallest finger: and there are two branches to it.
And there are three veins in the thigh and in the foot.
One of them is which is under the thumb curve coming from the lateral side of the thigh.
And the second one is the Saphenous vein: its location is at the heel, coming from the domestic lateral side.
And the Nesse vein: its location is at the heel on the lateral side of the thigh.
And there are three veins like those in the thigh elsewhere.
Regarding bloodletting, two veins after the ears.
For bloodletting, the two veins that are found after the ears are beneficial for old coughs, and headache, and earache, and bad sores in the head.
And the quality of bloodletting is as I am telling you.
And it is to cut the head of the patient: and its scalp should be rubbed with a good friction using a rough cloth at the site of the two veins.
Then let the patient hang his neck with galls (a type of leather) until the two veins become visible.
And their locations are behind the ears at two depressed spots on the head.
So find them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, there mark it with hot wax.
Then take the bloodletting tool, which is called the Incidens.
And then insert it under the vein into the skin until the bloodletting tool reaches the opening (the orifice).
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin up towards the top, and cut the vein along with the skin in the incision.
And let the length of the incision be equal to that of two joined fingers, or roughly so, and allow as much blood to escape as you can.
Then bind it with powders, and let it go free until it heals.
And now precedes at the beginning of the book the cutting of them and their cauterization.
¶ On bloodletting with two arteries simultaneously.
However, two arteries which are useful for bloodletting in the times of phlebotomy are: and the hot one and the obturator, and a running exudate from over-abundant discharges to the eyes. And the quality of bloodletting for them is as I am about to tell you.
The invalid should have their neck bound tightly until two veins become evident through apparent manifestation; and there should be a pulse beneath your finger of them.
Then the signs will appear with the cautery.
Then raise the skin above the vein towards the top with your index finger, and insert the bloodletting tool below and downwards, then lift the vein upwards.
And cut it as you did with other two veins: and make the blood flow out according to the need of your requirement. Then release the constriction of the invalid and place your finger on top of the vein for one hour.
Then place over it the skin and powders, and bind it tightly from above with a firm bandage; then let it go free until it heals.
And now a reminder about them and their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
On bloodletting for the forehead after Cephalic bloodletting.
However, the advantage of bloodletting for the forehead is after Cephalic bloodletting, against old facial ailments: and against migraines, and redness: and festering sores.
And the quality of this bloodletting is, as I shall tell you.
Restrict the sick person's neck with a bandage until a vein appears.
Then take the tool that is called The Fosserium.
And this is its form.
Place the突出 point of The Fosserium which is at the head over the vein, and hit it with the tines or with another tool in a similar manner. And let the blood flow according to how much you wish.
Then release the puncture of the sick person and tighten it until they heal.
And sometimes an opening is made with a wider bloodletting tool.
However, it is not necessary for the bloodletting tool to have a sharp end like the other bloodletting tools; rather, it should have a broader end.
And the bloodletting tool should follow the curve of your face since it is close to this area; and perhaps when the tool is thin, it might break at the mouth.
On bloodletting for veins around both Lacrymal areas.
However, the advantage of bloodletting for the two veins that are around both Lacrymal areas of the two eyes is against eye issues from scabies and redness: and facial ailing health within the eye, and ailments on the face.
And what is the quality of bloodletting for them, that the sick man should tighten his neck when he is bled.
Then perform bloodletting on her: and you should stand above her head.
And let the bloodletting be done according to the crossing at a slight lengthening with respect to the length of the blooddrawer, wide somewhat, for there is no flesh in that place.
For if the blooddrawer is thin at the extremity, perhaps it will break.
Then let there flow from the blood as much as you need for yourself.
And place over them cloths, and tighten them overnight once, then release them.
Section on bloodletting of the Nasal method.
The bloodletting method of the Nasal veins is for fevers that are acute and violent, and for facial discomforts such as migraines and ruddiness that occur in the face: especially when they are old.
And the quality of this bloodletting is such that the sick person should tighten their neck.
Then hold their nose with your left hand and take the thin, long blooddrawer. Attach it at the middle of its own snout, between that which distinguishes its nose according to its direction.
Because the vein is not perceptible by touch there and since blood begins to flow immediately.
And you should hold your hand with the blooddrawer somewhat wide open: and let there flow from the blood as much as you need for yourself.
Then tie that overnight once.
Itself, she/he will be restored quickly.
The instruction for bloodletting from Guidegian's surgical guide.
Two thirds of Guidegian's instruction on bloodletting is useful for constriction of breathing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic ailments, and scabies, and bad sores, and corrosive ones, that is, blistering diseases.
And the quality of this bloodletting is to tighten the sick person under their neck with a bandage at both sides: and let the surgeon stand above the sick person's head, and let the sick person sit on a chair.
Then, the bloodletting instrument should be of similar length to the bloodletting practice somewhat more broadly.
Then extract from the blood a quantity that is tempered, or according to what you see from necessity which corresponds to this.
Then do likewise for another vein.
Afterwards release the bandage and tie up both veins tightly in the middle: so that the sick person is not burned.
And let her go until morning.
For the wound is healed.
The instruction for bloodletting by Algeberrich.
The improvement for Algeberich's bloodletting is: because it aids in alcohol in the mouth and gum decay: and bad sores: and cracks of the lips, and bad sores, even those that are in the nose, and around its circumference.
And the quality of this bloodletting is to make you sit the sick person in front of you: and tie their neck with a girth.
Then turn their lips and look at two veins: one is from the right lip, and the other is from the left of them: and the demonstration of each is through the darkness of the beard.
And this is true: because around them are tiny, black veins.
Therefore, proceed with both cuts in the same direction. But if there is doubt about you, and you do not know which one it is: then proceed to the cut of the larger one, and that will be more obvious.
And similarly do it with the two veins in the upper lip: and a great deal of custom comes with that, and proceed with the two veins in the lower lip.
Section on Bloodletting: The vein under the tongue after cephalic bloodletting.
Regarding the two veins which are under the tongue for bloodletting: it is that, cephalic bloodletting is useful for anticipatory measures in the throat, and nausea, and illnesses of the mouth.
And the quality of bloodletting for these is, to have the sick person seated between your hands facing the sun: and raise their tongue, and look under his/her tongue from the side, one vein from each side: and the color of both declines towards blackness.
Therefore, bloodlet both veins: and be careful not to let your last hand come into contact with the bloodletting on them.
For beneath them are arteries, and perhaps there might be a flow of blood from those arteries.
Section on the three veins in the elbow.
The three veins that are bloodlettable in the elbow are those for which there is a custom of bloodletting in all people.
And their bloodletting is done according to two methods.
Or by pricking with a myrtle bloodletting tool: or by oiling to hasten its descent: or by cutting with a surgical knife, and this is called Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is, suited for sectioning.
And from these, there are broad forms and subtle ones according to the width of the veins and their tension. The Myrtle blood抽出 tool would have a broad form as you see.
And it is suitable for opening up concave veins, full ones, those that proceed, those that are visible, large, and those containing thick, turbid blood.
And this blood抽出 tool is of lesser width and has finer ends.
And it is suitable for blood抽出 of thin veins that contain thin yellow blood.
¶ On blood抽出 from the Basilica.
The Basilica vein, which is one of these three veins for blood抽出, proves to be useful. Because it draws blood from the sicknesses which are below the throat and neck, because they follow the chest and belly: and it is suitable for the blood抽出 instrument with respect to the basilic vein, so that it avoids her, and be on guard about fear of her since under her is an artery.
If therefore she misses, and adds to the point of the blood抽出 instrument, it will strike that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Therefore, it is necessary that the blood抽出 instrument be not used with a prick instrument: rather, use it with Alnesil.
If the Basilica does not appear with its obvious manifestation, then it is necessary to remove that one and exchange to another vein, or look for a part of it: or use the blood抽出 instrument instead of it as the arm cord.
Indeed it is evident, and dry it with a phlebotomy sponge, as we said.
If you are performing phlebotomy on the same limb, then it is necessary to precede the arm's constriction until you can touch the site, so as to recognize where to apply pressure.
Then, mark the site with the hot wax (encaustic method), afterwards apply to the arm and cut the vein with an inwardly concave incision using the phlebotomy tool Alnesil, as we have said.
And beware not to hit through the space towards the place of the artery.
And when you see that, with the constriction of the ligature, there is an expansion at the spot marked with wax, then that swelling is due to the artery. Therefore, it should be treated accordingly.
If you see that blood rises at the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and it is thin, red; then you will know because it comes from arterial blood.
So then act promptly, and place your finger on the area for a while, then remove your finger.
So if blood is being removed (for much is removed), then constrict the arm, and release it. And be cautious of the patient's movement: let him lie on his fear.
And do not move him for a few days until he is healed.
If however no blood is being removed and it overcomes you: and if there is no medicine available to you at the moment, then cut into the artery if you see it.
Because its extremities contract and blood is being removed.
Or take a piece of the bark of the elm tree and grind it. Take half and apply it over the place where the vein should be tied, along with the ligature until another day.
Then if blood is removed, it is good.
And if not: then take care of it with him to whom remembrance of its place from the location of powder flow out is good. And the removal of blood from him is not difficult in many positions due to the scarcity of wounds and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
¶ On bloodletting with the Fossa Venæ.
Bloodletting from the Fossa Venæ is helpful as it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower parts of the body. This is because it consists of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is suitable for the bloodletter that there should be a scar from his bloodletting, because under it is a nerve.
If therefore they add to the puncture of bloodletting and finds a nerve, an accident happens there that causes him to be dazed, and his recovery becomes difficult, and perhaps he will not be completely healed.
And this nerve often appears to the sense.
If however it is hidden in some people, and is fine and not visible: then you should use your bloodletting method where you can find the nerve, cut with Alnesil, and avoid hitting the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein longitudinally.
¶ On the Cephalic Vein.
Bloodletting from the Cephalic Vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and aids in eye ailments.
And it is necessary to perform bloodletting properly in this vein if you wish, using a greasy bloodletting tool or a myrtle-based bloodletting tool: because it is the most favorable of all veins as there is neither artery nor nerve below it. However, it is necessary for you when performing venous bloodletting to instruct the bloodletter to place only the head of the lizard (i.e., the needle), and search for a softer spot: and it does not harm him if he cannot be found with percussion first, so that he might pass over it several times with the bloodletting tool. However, it may happen in some individuals that the lancet should not be applied with percussion first when venous bloodletting is performed, but this fact of leaving a puncture does not harm him in any way.
¶ On the utility of Venous Bloodletting and precautions to be taken in performing it.
The quality of venous bloodletting and the events resulting from it require you to think about their correction.
Firstly, you must understand for what reason it is necessary that when bloodletting is not performed without consideration for health preservation and perseverance, or precautions against the onset of sickness.
And for bloodletting to be done using three veins in the arm, namely the cephalic vein, the dark (or basilic) vein, and the femoral vein.
And bloodletting should be done at the beginning of Vespers on an empty stomach, truly and in summer: and in autumn and winter after convalescence, when signs of fullness are evident.
And bloodletting should be done on the first or third day, after more than three hours have passed from the beginning of the day.
As for bloodletting performed during sicknesses, it does not have a specific time set. Rather, when the occasion and necessity call for this, it can be done at night or day, at any hour, and at any time.
And it is not necessary to perform bloodletting on children until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neither is a pregnant woman subjected to bloodletting, unless from the fourth month up until the seventh.
Old men are not subjected to bloodletting, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore, when someone wishes to undergo bloodletting for any reason: it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines before bloodletting using a mild enema, if there is a lot of retained feces in them: so as not to attract the veins during bloodletting from the intestines putrid excesses harmful to vital limbs.
Neither is bloodletting performed on the patient who has nausea from satiety: nor the drunken one, nor the one recovering from drunkenness, until that thing is removed from them.
Neither is a sick person with hydrocele.
And it should be avoided for bloodletting immediately after a bout of colic, vomiting, abdominal discharge, increase in sexual activity, labor, exercise, vigil, fasting, and anything that dissipates virtue from bodily or animal matter.
Then consider the subtlety of fluids beforehand, if blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible to do that.
Then take a bath if nothing forbids it: or engage in some exercise to thicken the blood.
And perform bloodletting on his chest on the third day, as we said: and try to have him evacuate from his chest that day with all animal illnesses: such as constriction, anger, and fear. And from all bodily events, like labor, punishment, excessive sexual activity, and similar things.
And let his place be filled with things before which the custom of men runs like a habit from their fragrance, and aroma, and flavor, and similar things by quantity to the possibility.
Then the bloodletter sits above the bleeding trough, which should be higher than the bleeding trough for bloodletting: afterwards he extends his arm and rubs it with his own hand twice or three times.
Then he ties the ligament with a twist, and wraps it around him twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when an uneven constriction is present, or due to excess in the constriction, then it obstructs the blood flow. Or if there's a laxness, then too it obstructs the blood flow.
Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the blooddrawer rubs his own hands simultaneously on the site of constriction until the veins are filled and their presence becomes apparent to touch.
Then, the blooddrawer cleanses the blooddrawer with a little oil, appropriately and traditionally.
Then, place his index finger of the left hand on the vein at the desired location for bloodletting, only slightly. So that it does not make the vein disappear and a strike is set.
For at bloodletting, what you find in the veins is like a fleeing string: and from them there's one that's filled with wind. And when you place your blooddrawer on it, it contracts under the blooddrawer, and thus the blooddrawer misses the strike and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, then it becomes tight due to this reason; hence for this purpose, the blooddrawer should be firmly in place and attentive to all these matters.
Then, let the blooddrawer release.
And if not, then try another place under that spot with a little pressure or above it with direction. If the spot does not respond.
If he is weakened by the operation or if it extends for too long, then release him on that day, or after two days: and do not tighten the bandage.
Perhaps it might attract a hot abscess.
Nor should he enter the bath.
Then perform bloodletting again if he enjoys it.
If the incision is small or if the blood flows thinly: and you fear that too much will not come out from the blood than desired; then perform repeated bloodletting in the hole itself according to its direction, and add a little less in the operation.
And do that with caution before the wound starts to heal, as the wound heals in many people after a small operation.
If you see that it is already forming pus, then do not repeat it over it at all, for nothing excuses anything in front of you. And place some of the oil from the fat over it: because it expedites the course of the blood.
And this is better in this place than just oil and other kinds of oils.
And similarly administer the fat of oil in all your bloodlettings, where bloodletting prevents the flow of blood using veins: and they do this with Tyrian crocus, and saffron, when it is placed on one of them over the place.
Blood becomes thinner and dissolves when it is thick.
If an abscess occurs at the site of bloodletting that is large, which happens quite often, especially to someone who has not been bled except by that method, or if a small incision of a vein is made, then proceed and place over the site a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated moderately: and tie it for an hour; because it will dissolve.
And it is necessary that you do this after the removal of blood from the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.
Indeed, it often happens with bloodletting and emaciation near the basilic vein.
Therefore place your hand over it, then if you find that area to be soft upon pressing your hand on it, then that prominence is bad.
Therefore, be careful to apply something from what we said on it.
For perhaps blood flows from that artery.
But make a plaster with it where there is coagulation, so that the place hardens.
Then take care of it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And it is necessary that you extract from every person according to the amount of their strength in blood.
And what becomes apparent from the fading color over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it pass until it becomes red: and similarly if you see that it is thick: then let it go on passing until it becomes fine: and similarly if it is sharp, let its sharpness be removed until it passes.
And it is necessary for the person who is full, strong, and needs to be bled by one method that the bloodletting should increase within the vein, and become a lateral bloodletter: and in the one who is weak, it should be opposite of this.
And it must be that he removes it in veins, and that there is a tight opening: and better when applied in bloodletting of veins, that there is a cross section, not piercing.
And this method of bloodletting is beneficial against the flow of blood and the injury to nerves: and it is more commendable and more beneficial than bloodletting across the width and length.
And for those who are accustomed to undergo bloodletting with syncopation, it should be that the meals before bloodletting consist of a moderate amount of bread soaked in pomegranate water: or if the bread is toasted, that's fine as well. And you should take from his blood three times, or four times.
And if it is a cold disposition, then before bloodletting, he should take bread soaked in honey syrup, or in flavored honey syrup with herbs, or in flavored syrup.
And if it happens that he experiences syncopation during bloodletting, and there is a reason for the flow of his blood to be abundant, then it should be that he drinks meat water and a subtle flavored syrup. He should use the aroma with algae and linseed oil on his chest with them. And he should make use of what we said in division regarding evacuation from syncopation in chapter "Excretion".
And if someone wants to bleed their arm and release their blood a second time: it should be for the person whose bloodletting is due to excessive evacuation, and their strength is weak, that they should gradually relieve the blood over quantities of strength on continuous days.
And if someone wants to bleed their arm and release more blood a second time, and their body is strong, then do that seven or nine hours after his first bloodletting.
Those who wish to draw blood from their body towards the opposite part of which they are inclined: it should happen to him on the second day or on the third.
In whose body there is much blood that has already been heated and sharpened, causing a fever to occur: it should happen that blood leaves this body through one vessel, and a large amount of blood is removed from it. The opening should be expanded until symptoms occur due to syncope. After you have maintained all the conditions for phlebotomy, and when placing your hand on his pulse along the course of the blood, ensure death does not occur in place of syncope.
Indeed, it often happens this: when the phlebotomist does not know and falls into negligence.
And it should not be when you wish to release the arm and remove blood after, while the vein's opening is already closed, making the removal of blood difficult. If it happens that the patient is in dizziness and they are trying to press upon it quickly, then it may cause a torn extension.
That is a serious mistake; indeed, release it until the second bloodletting has occurred.
Or remove with the sharpness of a bloodletting tool that which has coagulated from the blood in the vein's opening, and place something dissolved in water over it.
And place something from the ashes of rue or salazone over it, and apply it with gentle compression until blood flows.
If indeed the pustule is on the vein, then let it go and do not keep it until the pustule calms.
If necessity prompts for a second bloodletting and there is no excuse, then either apply the bloodletting tool over that place or on another arm in another vein.
However, if they cannot find the veins of the arm as a substitute for Fuscae and Basilica when they are not present and hidden, because it is composed from them.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the sick person inserts his hand into warm water until it flushes red and a vein becomes distinctly visible.
Then, when a medium constriction is applied with the band over it.
Then perform the phlebotomy along the direction of the flow gradually, not longitudinally or laterally. And make the opening wide, and your phlebotomy should be large enough to fit a phlebotomy over the incision on the hand in the vicinity.
And quite a lot of the blood's flow is conducted through warm water during the winter time.
And this vein's phlebotomy is beneficial to all veins because it is not under that pulsating vein nor a nerve.
The phlebotomy of Saluatella's right hand is effective against stomach pains.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you bind the hand with a band or your own hand after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein fills and becomes evident to the touch.
Then perform the phlebotomy by flowing across (the area).
And if you hit it entirely, that will not harm him in any way.
And conserve, do not let your last hand touch the bloodletting instrument.
For under it (the surface) are the nerves of the fingers exposed through the flesh.
Then move your hand to the warm water, and let the blood flow in that.
For if you do not move her (the patient) into warm water, the blood will clot in the puncture of the vein, and prevent it from flowing.
And when you have extracted the necessary amount from the blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not harden quickly.
And similarly you should do with every tightened branch.
However, the advantage of bloodletting from his left hand is this: because it leads to the spleen disorders; and similarly do in his bloodletting as you did in the second equal.
The advantage of saphenous bloodletting is for ailments that occur in the lower part of the body, such as womb disorders, retention of menses, and kidney illnesses, as well as old sores on thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
And the quality of his bloodletting is for the patient to immerse his foot in warm water and perform friction until the veins overflow; and tie above the cut on the foot with strips.
And indeed the location of the veins is at the heel, facing the big toe: and they branch out from there into many branches on the face of the foot.
Therefore, perform bloodletting at the wider branch of it or near the heel in its collection point: for it is better and more beneficial.
If phlebotomy is performed on her at the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are under it above the surface of the foot.
And suppose you perform your phlebotomy in such a way that you hit the arterial system from an oblique direction, as if you were to strike it: let the phlebotomy be done by Nesil.
If the flow of blood is obstructed, then immerse his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into that until it is drained.
If the surgeon makes a mistake during his first operation, then he should proceed with another phlebotomy towards the upper parts, for there is safety in that area, and you do not fear harm when you avoid the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the other opposite ankle.
The location of the sciatic veins, as we said, is at the heel on the outer side.
The beneficial aspect of his bloodletting is to alleviate pain in the heel when this is due to hot blood.
The quality of his bloodletting is such that the sick should enter into bathing water and relax. And bind his leg from the side of the heel up to four fingers above the heel with a thin, long bandage; for it does not appear otherwise.
When it becomes apparent, then a bloodletting is made according to whatever skill you have, or by an oblique direction: and it's better, whether by making an incision or cutting through.
Its location is safer, and it is greatly hidden in many people.
If you do not find it and it does not appear clearly to the senses: then perform bloodletting on some of its branches, and that one which appears in the heel and towards the ear is it. And beware of the nerves, and let a quantity of blood flow from your strength.
Then release the constriction, and place the spot for phlebotomy with fat, and tighten the area.
Indeed, it is quickly healed.
¶ On Wind Movement, and the quality of its use.
Chapter 98.
Winds are produced from grains, and from air, and from windpipe.
And Wind Movement occurs according to two methods.
One method is with incision and bloodletting: the other is wind movement without incision. And this Wind Movement which occurs without incision happens in two ways.
Or it is when using fire.
Or it is without the use of fire.
And wind therapies that are administered with incisions and bloodletting apply to fourteen body areas.
And there are fourteen body areas where wind therapies administered with incisions and bloodletting can be applied. One of these is the Wind Movement Alnocrati, which is at the very end of the head: another is Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck. There are two Wind Movements Alhagdahim, corresponding to both sides of the neck simultaneously: there's also the Wind Movement on the brain, below the jawbone under the lower part of the mouth; this is another one called Wind Movement of the shoulders. A Wind Movement called Alachosos is found at the end of the tail: There are two Wind Movements known as focilium which are in the middle of both upper arms: there are also two Wind Movements on each leg, and finally, there are two Wind Movements associated with the kidneys.
And indeed, Wind Movement does not draw blood from tiny punctures scattered on your body. Because of this, its power doesn't diminish like it would after a bloodletting procedure.
It is not necessary for the inhalation of air, with or without fire, to be given when sickness occurs due to fullness, until the entire body has been evacuated.
If necessity prompts us to perform an inhalation due to sickness or because of a habit, we should administer it at any time during the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of that period, and at whatever time it happens.
This is because there are people who, when the blood increases within them until it needs to be removed through inhalation, find their head heavy and dizzy.
And among them there are those who find fullness and redness on their face, head, and neck.
And among them there are those who find itching on their face and forehead, darkness, and confusion in their eyes.
And among them there are those who feel the spot of where their inhalation occurs. And among them is the person whose laughter increases.
And among them there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth: or they may be troubled by their tongue and expel blood.
And among them is the person whose sleep increases.
And among them is the person who sees blood and redness, as well as dead people and wounds, and things similar to these, during their sleep. So when we see anything from these (indications), and especially during the middle third of the month: we then command that inhalation take place after passing two hours or three. The improvement of the inhalation at the back of the neck is: because it brings heaviness to the head and what flows reaches the eyes.
