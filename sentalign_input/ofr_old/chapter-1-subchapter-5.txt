of the pain in the ears due to cold
When cold-induced pain comes in the ear, and purgative medicines and other treatments mentioned in the division have been applied, and the pain does not move, then heat this cautery called "poins", which has this shape:
Then prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and distance yourself a little above the root of the ear once you have marked the spot with ink; and make ten pricks around each ear; afterward treat the spot until it is healed.
