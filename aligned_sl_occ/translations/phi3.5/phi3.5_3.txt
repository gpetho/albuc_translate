And you have completed this book of medicine for me, which is the second half of science and comprises explanations from your work on it; through them I perceive that you've thoroughly handled what concerns surgical procedures within its scope, in line with our discussion today about medical operations. (Note: This translation attempts to preserve as much meaning as possible while making sense for modern English speakers.)
When the operation is prostrated in our region and at all times of total privacy, only because I have witnessed its science, and they (the doctors) study it; except that a few descriptions found freely among Ancient Greeks are modified by me herein for errors to which their intentions belong now closed off from understanding due to the lengthening of time's span as well as art itself.
Here it is said to me that you have seen my order in the second part of this text according to its method of presentation and explanation, as well as abbreviation; therefore, for the purpose of these tools' use (cauterizing instruments) and other devices needed for carrying out this task, which requires.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Through what Aqua Ippocrates says is necessary for health and healing, it mainly concerns the work of the body (and possibly also in a larger capacity within its nature).
May we already have the knowledge of that in this book'dict; who do not know what we told them about anatomy, they will fall into error and die because they did not see much of these things themselves, which are formed by this science and taken from its teachings and experiments.
Here is the line-by-line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
Here comes another doctor who ordered the patient to drink a stone from a jar which he had processed in his state; the stone was large and came into him through a straw held by that same doctor on the third day, leading to the death of this home (body).
And you have called it out (to remove), and because of the greatness of the stone and due to the positioning within the uterus, come under here that they might die.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And there is another doctor who takes pay from our duke of this land for surgery; and with him comes a black instrument which he claims was broken in his patient'se thigh, using it on the ground among pillows and tables where its strong structure does not permit breath.
Here is the line by line translation:
And they called upon him (likely referring to the doctor), and used tools to loosen the ligaments, achieving relief from their pains.
Even though corruption in the limb has been confirmed, it cannot be restrained and will not stop moving within while being under the influence of humidity.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And another doctor pierced an abscess, and it became ulcerated within days, as its evil spirit was at the lord'thy service.
The cause is that the head is burdened by melancholalic humors; it does not occur in all of him, but rather in the member which has suffered throughout.
For you, it is necessary that the operation be planned in two ways: one associated with health (the surgery for healing), and another where there is danger in major procedures (in surgeries involving significant risk).
Here comes the first sentence to translate:
So take up your weapons in solicitude and for the protection of God, and your illnesses as fortification and strengthening.

Whenever gout appears in some of her mixtures: Not a doctor treats bad illness without naming it.
And you have already fallen into this book for the second time three chapters in length.
Begin with the separation of free will, and first in primary division. The ordered first chapter within the head of weight, concerning the tools and instruments as well as for what is necessary in operation.
La division of the second portion. The second chapter on cauterization and puncturing, and of pills, poultices, and extractions from herbs and simples to these matters is fully organized according to the forms of instruments used.
The third part of restoration and dislocation management, as well as treatment for twists and appearances to these matters; the head positioned within the pelvis, with forms taken by instruments.
When you pour out the quality of that poultice and its applications within him, wherein it is forbidden to use a poultice.
So the translation goes: Thus it is said that the discourse of cautery and its non-essential (the irrelevant part) is long and elaborate, requiring delicate knowledge; they speak much about this topic, are in disagreement with each other, which for me suffices a small portion of their discussions. Here we understand doctors engaging in detailed conversation concerning the use and application of cautery tools while also expressing divergent opinions on these matters—the speaker finds enough information to satisfy them after hearing only part of this discussion.
So it is said that the art of cautery treats all matters universally as its subject or material, with the exception of two complexities (which are referred to here simply as 'complexes'), these being parts related to his/her matter. Here doctors recognize a general approach in their application and understanding of this medical tool; however, there seems to be an acknowledgment that some specifics regarding its use might require additional consideration beyond the universal method described thus far—perhaps referring to more nuanced cases or
In the complexity of dry matter they disagree; some argue that it is beneficial for this type with respect to its quality and aridity, while others counter that in such a condition (quality/dryness), application or use of cautery would not be suitable—as water itself embodies both these qualities. Herein doctors are debating about the appropriateness of using cautery on materials characterized by dry and specific nature, with some suggesting it's beneficial due to its inherent properties aligning (or being similar) to those required for effective treatment while others believe such an approach would be counterproductive. The underlying concern is that applying heat or making something wet—essentially the function of cautery in this context —to these conditions could potentially undo any therapeutic effect, possibly causing harm instead due to contradicting essential qualities like moisture and dryness inherent within water which might be required for healing. This indicates an important aspect where medieval practitioners considered the specific needs of different bodily states when applying their treatments—highlighting that even then they recognized conditions
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Through that speech of his, I have discovered some things for myself at times.
Even if there is a need to withdraw over the one that has already been exposed and exercised in the field of cautery for today's practice, understand their complexity as humans and how maladies are positioned within them; know also the causes of these illnesses and what should be done about them.
May occur in other complexities as well, not out of fear but primarily due to the presence of moist and effused humors; all doctors are agreed on this, without concern for bleeding during drainage in those areas.
And learned physicians who understand the art of healing by fire and know their patient well, they use surgical tools on the focus (area being treated), which only affects the limb that is cauterized, without causing harm to other parts of the body at all.
May the medicine' extricate come to that in his limbs which has been unattended upon and forcefully bring relief into the ill-limbed member, causing it also not to withdraw from its healing course quickly.
May the focus (or center), due to its sublimity and benevolent nature, only serves when there is excess; we have come to know this through experimentation and long study of servitude in pursuit of knowledge about truths regarding causes; thus granting an excuse for lengthy discourse. And if it were not that I am bound by my time here (in the pause), during which you secretly manipulate me, your aim at focusing on this focus will demonstrate a philosophical argument made through speech, proving itself convincing in our minds as well.
And learned ones (doctors), who understand when it is most suitable to perform cauterizations and restraints during the first days of life, they do so accordingly.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
So do not put pressure on your feet or legs; ordinary people and medics only estimate it poorly, hence healing through cauterization is not complete at once, and thus the consequences follow.
The cause is not due to the absence of water which our bodies need, rather cautery tools are only used in medicine that alter and dry out these fluids whose lack leads to pain.
Even though there are excessive points above medical practice due to the patient' extraneous vitality and greatness of their lord, they may use cautery where necessary for treatment.

This cauterization confers moisture and cold on the accident that is your cause; it arises from bile and excessive flow of rheumatic fluid, which presses down forcefully, from head to limbs and fingers, as well as from prolonged sleeping, toothache, gout, and universally throughout all diseases brought about by chilliness.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the hump to be evacuated by medicine-taking for three or four days, according to how much exertion it takes and their habitus (constitution).
And order it so that the patient'dict head rests on their chin and place your hand above them, between yours over a lowered bed to support their hands.
Return your hand resting on the back of your palm, placing it over the bridge of your nose between their nostrubs (nostril). Whenever the patient says they have felt warmth in that place where it has been reached by fire (suggesting heat or an inflammatgy), signs indicate this spot, and with bellows apply fire to the cautery made of olive wood used for these purposes.

May I not see all these kinds of cautery tools for everyone here; but should you be among those wise men in this place who fear the practice'dictated by us today—and especially when your head is bald due to sun exposure, as often happens with melancholic individuals (referring back to our observations made while examining other body members), then I would wish it better for my health if you were here.
The translation of the provided medieval medical treatise from a language resembling Latin, Italian, Spanish and French would be as follows:
Capitol second.
Of the pointed cautery of the head
When in total the head suffers chronic and long-lasting pain, which is prolonged within the malady, using swords and lances and scourges and thumping hammers and heavy axes and clubbing devices and bludgeon weapons, as well as servitude when already cauterized with a single instrument that does not further explore any of these causes; provided that the head's swelling within the malady is due to excessive phlegm in its nature—it is not cruel nor brutal force but rather an alternative treatment using other instruments at once. Return that over the head of your skull for it is necessary to perform caution within when the spinal column has been divided. Cut the neck and reveal the bone'sup to which we have measured out and treated it with a cauterizing instrument in the part of the back where you call for treatment—this is also the place where air pressure has been applied (the term "ventosa" refers here to manual or suction cupping, possibly used by medieval doctors). And raise your hand firmly, and do not touch the belly, for that which is aggrathy in it causes a great different pain from other brandings on the body's surface.
Here you direct the cautery to its place, four covers whereby that which is inside these very cauteries becomes what this instrument here represents; and thus it constitutes our method.
Capital pain or discomfort (assuming "ters" is
The Latin phrase provided appears to relate to an ancient medical practice, likely involving some form of treatment for a condition that was possibly referred to with the term used here (per
When joint pain becomes severe or when the aching penetrates deep into the body as in a feverish limb (likely meaning an arm experiencing inflammation due to heat), physicians should apply immediate care and administer another form of treatment, which is referred herein with terms that denote healing remedies for diseases; thus not neglecting this condition. The twofold method of cauterization used consists either as a direct medical intervention burning away acute combustion (a historical reference to treating inflammation or infection), or by means of iron, perhaps suggesting the use of hot irons or metal for similar treatment purposes.
May scalpels of medicine burn to take hold a vessel (potentially referring to the body or an organ), and you extract both ends from them together with these instruments, holding onto their limbs as well.

And if you will use some of these prescribed remedies in water within the treatment regimen for inflammat0ration, be cautious as they may burn or react when dissolved together. (This sentence warns about potential reactions between different medicines used in a liquid form.)
Here, the treatment mentioned likely involves using heated iron instruments for purposes such as removing unwanted tissue or closing wounds. The specific form of this technique appears to be heat application (possibly through burning). This could refer historically used medical procedures where controlled fire was applied—a practice which may have been considered therapeutic at the time
Calls for a tool resembling a nail or pinpoint instrument that maintains its shape and can induce slight curving; this is employed in the specific area being treated to facilitate penetration (likely referring here to skin) with precision, as indicated by "in the place of it stands out." Here, there might be an emphasis on using a particular tool for delicate body work—possibly acupuncture or cauterization where needles are inserted into specific points.
Maintain your hand over the location of pain to ensure that the instrument (possibly an iron needle or pin) does not become stuck, and rotate it slowly—in small increments for better control; this technique could be aimed at relieving discomfort while using a pointed healing device. Here, there is likely advice on how delicately one must handle sharp medical instruments to prevent injury during procedures like acupuncture or other forms of physical therapy that involve touching the
If the quantity of liquor that is absorbed through the mouth has reached its measure, then your hand should be placed there to prevent the vessel from being filled further and not allowing any excretion flow downwards (flux sancti).
Return the bandage in saltwater and place it over the location for three days, then pause the application of liniment at the border, and provide care with oil within which healing may occur.
If you go on, perform the lancet according to cautery instruments, and ensure that there is no incision of an artery here without proper care at this time.
Capitol Quart (This is not directly translatable
The phrase "Cauterizacio d'emigrante antica" can be translated as "Ancient emigrant burn treatment." Here,
When you treat the ancient emigrant's ailment, remember what has been said about healing before and within the divisions of diseases; if not proficient in either medical cauterization or focus burning techniques to alleviate pain along its long lines—these are where suffering resides—then you must use fire for these cutaneous (skin) burns, purifying them until they become white. Place your hand over the location of discomfort along this lengthy line; rest there with a vigilant and steadfast grip using an iron dagger or sword to return it inside through openings made by arrows while ensuring that you maintain pressure for some time within those incision sites, until help arrives.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuous movement of the jaw, which grinds its teeth (bruxism), and ensure that there'thy not a lockjaw nor tension in those nerves affected by such action; so as not to provoke spasms.
If it is about the guardianship and caution of blood flow from the artery that opens up, there'thy fear in this opening itself, mostly towards what he does not know as cause or effect, which escapes his understanding—therefore perform surgery on him with care.
When you come at recall of the regimen for the flow of sanction aftercare according to our rule'dictum, in this free place hereby provided:
If you feel this malady does not supply the necessary amount for this treatment and if it becomes intolerable on the part of the swelling in your head (which we have mentioned before), then cauterize that area with a heated lancet where blood has been drawn, as noted previously. Care must also be taken to ensure the inside is healed within these bounds.
If you come now, administer the one we have mentioned in the chapter of steel sharpness for hot lancets used to perform two cuts, and this is considered a better cauterization method.

For alleviation of the pains in joints." – Translation: The Latin phrase "Cauterizacio de les dolors de aurelhas
When in the ulcer there is pain due to exudate and for its other healing that I have mentioned herein, it is not relieved by mere medication; this is where cautery comes into play. Here refers to what has been discussed regarding treatment methods—specifically mentioning when conventional medicine does not suffice in alleviating pain from an ulcerative condition (likely referring to a sore or wound). The use of heat, implied by the term 'igneys' which translates roughly as "fires" or could be understood metapreviously used treatments), is suggested for cauterization. Cautery here means applying localized heat with an instrument (likely metal in this context) to seal off bleeding and promote healing,

It suggests that punctures should be made where necessary using the appropriate instrument, and this process is intended not just locally but across all affected areas of the body—comparable in motion to a wheel being turned through rotation or along And love you, this heating tool (cauterizer) of the ulcer's base that is near your flesh wherein to attempt." – Translation: The line appears poetic and somewhat metaphorical in its reference; it seems as though a caregiver or physician might use affectionate language when using cauterization tools on someone who

The given text is written in an archaic form of Romance
Cauterize bruises." (This translation attempts a direct interpretation based on the Latin root "cauter,
The one that is healed through caulking and not just by the medicines coming in via veins," according to what has been mentioned about their division of diseases (the implication being spices or other substances administered topically). Here, "cautery" refers specifically to a treatment involving heat application—often with something like a heated iron tool through which medicinal herbs are burnished and applied directly onto the wound site. This aligns
Avoid caulking with dryness or by nervous cramps." The speaker advises against the application of certain remedies that might cause further discomfort, such as those which could lead to dehydration (dryness) or exacerbate
When you heal that herb of caulking for erosion and purgation, making sure your treatment does not hinder it, then take three types of cautery: the gold needle (aurelha), a small touch from your statue [idol] or idol's temple ([templar]), and lips joined together by kisses." In this guidance offered to those performing medical care at that time—which predates modern understandings, sterilization practices would not have been in place. The writer here provides specific instruments for their intended purpose: the gold needle likely serves as a thermal device due to its conductive properties; touching or kissing by lips may be seen metaphorically as applying personal energy during healing rituals—a common belief held that spiritual and physical forces could interplay in recovery. This reflects an era where medicine was both empirical, through observation of effects like heat from gold needles on wounds (their thermal conductivity), but also mystical or superstitious with practices involving personal connections to
Pause the pointed cautery for the contrary parts of the diseased area; therein it will only relieve in the portion that appears healthy.
The method of cauterization is that you apply the lancet directly on top of the head bone, and in the temple area (the length corresponds to the patient's height), where your hand acts as a guide for the application of the cauterizing instrument until it has burned out the necessary amount from the wound near the jawbone.
This is how the cautery works, and it belongs to those who perform incision work (surgeons). Here we present this form today. May it be subtle that such a few bones are pushed out of place; and when the excess is in unnecessary bulk, then also only a little must be removed.
Return care is given where it flows currently as part of the healing process.

The action of the pointed cautery is said according to its use.

The phrase translates to English as:

Return their head on top of the thigh and place your hand undernethy to immobilize it with a crutch described in the treatise for splints.
And after some time has passed, that is when it becomes necessary for caution (with a pointed cautery). When that doctor has already said what is necessary for him thereafter,
And if there are sanitizing waters for them; otherwise, they will need three cauterizations in the back portion of their head (the area from above the nape to just below the neck), which belong respectively to that partition coming forward and one partaking of it going backwards. And between each of these cautions is placed its own care, and appropriate attention given the fluid that has come forth.
If you increase and the humors are tolerable in this place, then apply heat with caution here at the joint location; if there is more addition of swelling, then cauterize that over these two bumps.

These 'times' could indicate when treatment is most effective or necessary due to changes in humoral balance associated with digestion – a common conceptual framework
If it is an untreated child who suffers from the medicines (meaning perhaps a lack of remedy or failure to respond), then apply emollients and demulcentes externally for several days through motions, when foods are beneficial – suggesting that certain dietary components might aid healing at specific times.

Then lift the head of humors (perhaps a metaphor for bodily fluids that need balancing), and apply therein any caustic treatment at the crown spot where it has been previously applied, as per prior instructions – indicating an individualized approach to applying remedies. Moreover, another cauterium is placed on their occiput (back of head) and all over every horn or bone segment undernethy; suggesting a comprehensive method that addresses the entirety of each bodily component likely thought to be affected by imbalance – again reflecting an approach where localized treatment can have broader implications for restoring health.

If I use cauterization on it focuses where the malady enters through their hairs alongside those with which they inhabit; tighten until not even a worm can enter, and if one applies pressure to that part from my hand (the patient's), then bind them by bandages so that nothing may crawl inside while there are still newlings within. This directive implies an approach where cauterization is performed at the site of entry for any parasites or worms, tightly applying heat until no additional infestation can occur ("not even a worm"). If direct pressure from fingers (or another part used to press) causes discomfort upon application against this area in needing treatment, then secure them with bandages so that external intruders are prevented while the internal newlings continue their cycle of growth. This indicates an ancient medical practice where removal and containment through manual methods like cauterization (using heat or sharp instruments) followed by immobilizing applications such as binding were common strateg

Mayhap that which is convalescing will be better for its healing work.

And place the burning instrument therein that is ignited, and hold it thus with your hand; so that neither you nor the humors within are disturbed when placing this tool at the nose' extrication site to prevent its movement during application.
So if the bleeding from the cautery enters into the mouth, be; and otherwise, repeat the cauterization once or twice a week as per medical practice, leave it there for three days, then rest over that spot at the border until you send out healing ointments within which it shall recover.

Cauterization of tooth pain – Translation suggests a treatment method from the Middle Ages or old European medicine
When tooth pain is due to inflammation or a cold within the mouth, it does not respond well to treatment by medicine; in such cases, two types of caustic treatments are employed: one involving cow horns (horn licks), and another using hot irons. Translation interprets medieval medical approaches for treating dental pain when conventional medicines were deemed insufficient or ineffective due to inflammatory conditions within the mouth, suggesting alternative methods like thermally activated materials such as bovine horns (for their supposed antiseptic properties) and heated metallic objects.
Apply the horn's edge to heat that which is forged from cowhorn in fire and wrap it around the extremity of your touch; also apply cooling if previously heated, covering whereby you wish to cauterize (cauterize) inflamed areas within the mouth. This line describes a specific procedure used by medieval physicians when treating dental pain with heat as part of their therapeutic approach – likely involving some form of crude or rudimentary medical equipment made from available materials, such as cow horns and heated iron for direct contact to provide relief through cauterization.
Apply that again until the virtue (heat or power) of the focus arrives at the root of the tooth – here, they describe how long and often one should maintain heat application on an inflamed area in order for its curative effect ('virtue') to reach where it's needed most: directly into a problem
If you wish, submerge wool or a cautery in the space below it, and place that above the sore tooth, placing it over where the hot iron enters during scaling of the cavity of the affected tooth.
Even if the cauterization is at the focus of blood or iron (the blacksmith'se tools), and there is any swelling in the chest, ensure that this heat does not reach the mouth of the womb.
Return the cautery to its shape, and place it on your teeth so that the cautery is scalded; make several attempts until the pain subsides either today or tomorrow.
When the patient opens his mouth due to that which causes it, and after one hour we scrape it with this instrument—this is how the cautery works.
And apply what you have extracted according as it is within your capability.
This is how the catheter looks like:
The provided medieval medical text appears complex due to its fusion of Latin influence with Rom

When external lesions or ulcers are caused by infiltrating humors and do not submit to digestion through medicinal means; thus you must apply the cauterizing instrument with both ends ignited, ensuring that each end is sufficient for burning while maintaining control of flames. Do so briefly over those areas affected: once lit, hold one end until it cools down as needed (as required), and then insert this into another part afflicted by the lesion to continue treatment; proceed with caution such that you reach the root cause or focus point without causing additional harm.
If the abscess is little, then stop the application of cautery according to the quantity of the abscess; apply pressure for three days and pause until such a time that heat from the fire has diminished its size.
When such care is applied with wax and bandages within where it shall heal,
In this translation of the medieval medical text line by line into English, here is

Cauterization of the chest illness and cough: Here, it is implied that there may need to apply heat (which could be interpreted as a form of treatment such
When the chest illness and cough are caused by humidity, as they lack fever or inflammation (indicating a less severe condition in traditional medicine terms), then two types of heat application should be used: one on the sternum at joint points for lungs' relief; another is applied to body temperature under breast-like structures between breasts. The cauterization instruments are arranged according to previous forms/methods as indicated by context or tradition within this specific medical practice from medieval times, where treatment often involved direct application of heat and tools such as a pointed instrument (cauterizer) for healing purposes like expelling excess humors believed responsible for the malady.
If you wish to continue with the same type of point-based healing application for chest pains associated with auricular issues (pertaining specifically here as pain related to one's ears), follow these earlier methods, employing punctures precisely targeted at relieving earache discomfort: This line indicates that there is an established method involving the use of pointed tools or needles for treatment purposes. Such techniques were often used in medieval times before modern medicine was developed and reflect a broader understanding among he

(Here 'apos' means "after" or "following," indicating a sequence of actions; 'pausa sobre le cauteri porys cuytz am sal' refers to rest over these coarsening treatments, and ensures the humors are brought back into tranquility while providing comfort without weakening.)
If the dislocation is at those joints beneath and if pain occurs when pressing down upon them, then apply a caustic to muscle or one of the sharp cauterization points used for treatment; this confirms congruence and eliminates moisture (or effusion), allowing humors (blood fluids) to normalize. (Here 'la dislocacio' refers to joint displacement, which when pressed down indicates pain—a symptom often relating to musculosskeletal issues in medical context; applying a caustic helps by restoring the alignment and reducing excess moisture at these sites.)

Chapter XXVI pertains to the topic of caustic treatment for the stomach, likely discussing
When humors accumulate in the stomach and multiply within it, if you continue with healing treatments without providing restoration (the use of cauterization here suggests an attempt to alleviate excess fluids or pus), then blood will rise above its natural position when supine; extend your hands over those that are not properly adjusted so they may perform poppy inducement. This involves applying three types of caustic: one for the bone, wherein you determine dosage as per a specific cauterization method (implying tailored intervention), and two additional points on either side of such treatment to expel what is referred to metaphorically as "the triangle-cauterized figure" – likely indicating an area or set of symptoms formed by multiple sources; moreover, prolong the time for those not properly adjusted which may require further poppy inducement. (Here 'estomac' refers specifically to where fluids/pus have gathered in excess—a common medieval medical concern often treated with cauterization as a method believed to draw out and remove unwanted elements; dosages are carefully measured, suggesting tailored treatment approaches were customary for different body parts or severities of conditions. The reference to 'blood rising above its natural position' aligns historically with understanding fluid dynamics within the human anatomy.)

We are guided by medical tradition here – this implies that while innovative methods might be tempting or appear beneficial in certain aspects of treatment using cautery based techniques for joint pain caused by cold humors (as described earlier), it remains essential to adhere strictly to the well-estreemed and time-tested procedures outlined within medical science. We must prioritize patient safety above all else, thus following tried-and-true methods rather than unverified experimentation or deviation from established practice guidelines for treatment of such conditions

And thus apply it again briefly (implying that the application of heat should be periodic), so three different liniments are used to ensure lasting vitality: The practice here involves reapplying warmth or a healing ointment ("cauterize") in short bursts, using possibly several small-batch treatments.

This could mean directing warmth or a medicinal paste at specific spots on and around the bladder region, perhaps with woolen cloths to soak in this therapeutic medium (as suggested by "les pels del pentennielh"). These three distinct local treatments ("cauterizer") are strategically placed—on a spot of pus formation near urine leakage sites and spread across specific

The phrase "cauterize wounds" refers to the medical practice of applying a substance that generates extreme heat,
When wounds occur in the joints and points are made on the surface of the body using a heated tool, doctors say that this is necessary to stop bleeding into cavities (belly or abdomen) where internal organs reside. They command for warm compresses applied directly over these areas which act as mild stimuli intended not only to facilitate blood clotting but also alleviate pain through the soothing effects of heat, possibly preventing further damage and promoting faster healing by drawing out excess fluids from around injuries (bruising or hematoma).
And follow the thighs between your fingers on their two sides, and command that they hold their tongue inside so as to create an opening or a hernia may appear (or/and form bulging protrusions).

You have already opened the space between the patient'thy thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another atop their chest; holding your hands.
And place the cautery on that spot firmly in your hand, and when you have entered where those bones of the pelvis enter into sleep at midnight; repeat if by the end of this initial period entry into the bones has not been achieved with your own hands.
Observe carefully the intestine within the hour of your cautery, to ensure that it does not come out onto the abdomen or cause a greater harmful act.
When you realize that when using the cautery, you do not touch the patient's face, nor perform your operation on it.

Apply additional cauters on any ankle(s), apply ones for all present ankles; similarly, put them on each of your feet's toes and knuckles (fingers). Cover two per buttock joint, cover both leg muscles, as well as the tendons from where you take off socks. Cauterize this over all articulations in hands and feet, including any heel(s) of your shoes, and on each knee's cartilage (articular surfaces).
Guard your nerves that are over the ankle, so they do not burn those upon them.

Herein lies a directive suggesting an interval during which treatment is applied (possibly cauterization) followed by observation to ensure complete recovery from both visible marks ("scarring") of previous conditions, alongside the eradication of "decay" or disease.

Return the blood vessel and its contents from where it has burst open here (the location), applying pressure with this instrument to prevent further bleeding, thus performing internal cauterization on that wound.
If the sanction is expelled from the orifice of the artery as you move and extract the cauterys, then take another cauterium immediately used in that area for treatment; thus, do not cease performing this procedure until the sanc's restriction is secured.
And watch that you do not burn the nerves here present and bring them back over the thigh or other misfortune.
When the artery is blocked and it's not possible to relieve that condition in those regions, especially when the artery is large, unless one of four methods are available: or using cautery where we need them; if extraction is needed and cannot be extracted, then removing limbs together with combustion will restrict blood flow there too, either by ligature (tying) or bandaging for strong compression.

When you come in with blood, cover it quickly, my son, so that the fear of bleeding which is at the beginning of cauterization does not spread here.
For the sake of caution that is necessary here, during this operation where life itself comes into play through venous bleeding or catharsis (evacuation), removal of maggots or larvae, extraction of stones and incision on wounds—these actions must be performed with great care. When all of these accompany fear and trembling in the abdomen of them,

When encountering swelling or inflammation of the hips or chest area, and these are ancient times when such symptoms do not directly indicate a condition requiring medical treatment; rather, it is there that we start (or begin) with care in those very two arteries. This suggests an early understanding by medieval physicians of targeted intervention at specific sites where they perceived issues to originate or manifest severely – pointing towards limbs and chest which were critical for patient mobility and overall health, indicating a tailored approach even back then.
And when you intend to insert those humors into the patient's head, and rub vigorously the area covered by the hard cloth for it to appear as if opening arteries, tighten their collar bone with that same harsh fabric; take note of veins in each location where hair is plucked out, which are visible only on bald men.

When translating medieval medical texts, it's essential to understand the context and terminology used at that time which may differ significantly from modern languages like Latin or other contemporary
The entire cause of the pain in the fingers is one out of four species; it may be metallic like iron or silver, similar to those materials when combined with lead and glass (which they believed could affect bones), related to water flowing through pipes causing pressure issues, reminiscent of plant juices such as chickpea sap (similar in consistency but not the same substance) which causes fluid shifts within tissues leading to pain. It may also be due to some animal presence or an intrusion that prompts this ailment.
Therefore when blood flows in the earlobe or appears similar to these causes that do not align with it and stops flowing in the earlobe at sunr extrusion time, if you see the bloody discharge, then administer its removal, and apply treatments for pus formation. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If it is not drained (the affected area), then use the gentle instruments of which this is the form for extraction.
If it is an obstruction in labor (breech birth), be ready to act immediately; otherwise, administer its removal carefully over a few small doses of purgatives or emetics as needed.
Therefore, if there is an obstruction (foro-getada) by water or phlegm within the body, then place a straw of arsenic and insert its extremity into the thickness of the bronchus where it has come in contact with the obstacle. Insert this same thin end also at the entrance to prevent excess from being retained therein except for that which is inserted via the straw (canula). When you place your hand on the chest where it was tightly fastened together with forceps previously used by us today, those who have been restrained and examined are coming back into view again.
May not be forked in this mannerism, then take hold of the bone or hard device whereby their joints are pinched tightly together and pause there at the extremity of reach, and wrap carefully around that spot enveloped. And insert that into the disruption of the liver'gyne vein to ease it, and remove the liver from moistness.

And when the figure crack reaches the bone, and if the bone is crushed by your tool at that moment, then fix it with appropriate force there in time for healing to occur.
If the cause is in the liver and it swells up due to fatty substances that you believe are retained within, then administer treatment and removal of them; if not heeding your advice, apply a gentle touch under this manner. and administer that which was caught in his joint (the arthritis), from where it has emerged on the wrist, this is what must be treated:

May enter the water into which the wound is steeped for healing, and fill up that flask with cold wine, applying it to the spot on which this water resides; if by chance one becomes ill from drinking (indicating possible infection), then bile forms within them. Otherwise, take stones of flint or jasper according to length, place these upon the stone where the liquid is held, and heat that very same stone over a small fire until red hot. Then have the patient insert one such heated stone into their own wound on this particular partioned body area (presumably an arm), jump onto it with his hand for treatment as follows: Then let your fingers remain in contact with the skin until all the water has been drawn out (or "absorbed").
Then let your fingers remain in contact with the skin until all the water has been drawn out (or "absorbed").

When phlegm generated in the armpit occurs during extraction and you do not comfort your treatment as previously mentioned for that which we have discussed about this mucus in the axilla, then watch the armpit towards the sunlight.
So if there is any cause by worms here, then extract it either with gentle hands or not using a dart thrust below. If no such cause appears, take a thin catheter drawn above and away from you; this will be the form of treatment. And insert the subtlety into the artery according to the amount that sufferers may experience; and draw out impurities from there with strong suction, so long as all parasites are expelled.
May you not obey my instruction, then you will become pale and closed in the circuit of the catheter inserted with wax; administer these drips which have already been used in their treatment for parasites, thus removing them through the drainage system.

Some digestions in children's bellies are not perforated by tendons; and this matter is felt internally within the body of those individuals who have experienced it – specifically residing somewhere near or inside (in terms like 'dentro,' which would be translated as 'inside') such an area, often referred to with medical terminology linked with gout. It's possible that these experiences might manifest in various parts away from where initially felt ('diferentes partes lejos de donde se siente'), potentially including the tendon itself if it lacks proper covering or padding – a scenario possibly leading to discomfort and necessitating medical attention, aligning with medieval notions of disease symptoms related to internal body structures like bones (opulaci) as interpreted from your translation attempt.

If there is an abscess in the area of the earlobe, then apply gentle heat with this small flame and insert that into the flesh of the earlobe; also place it inside to prevent the pus from spreading further.

When wandering motions occur within the patient's eyelids (which might suggest an erratic or involuntary movement of the eyes), caused by whatever reasons that have led to their enhancement in size and tension, such condition is called "grandeyssa" due to its grandeur. Whenever this situation arises—referring perhaps to a serious eye disorder causing excessive lid protrusion or spasms—it necessitates an
Addition of heavy moisture into the patient's upper and lower eyelids is observed, which may indicate a condition where excessive tearing or fluid accumulation occurs in these parts of the eye structure due to various causes
Therefore, it is considered that the cause may be moisture appearing from within the patient' extricable (the eye), and this condition appears everywhere without exception—suggesting an overflow or excess of tears due to a blockage in their production system; such as with "leugiera," which could mean congestion, obstruction leading to watery eyes. In essence, if the large tearing issue is found within (in) one's eyelid and spread across all locations uniformly possibly indicating an underlying imbalance or blockage
Then you act upon that very fault line within the palpebrae (eyelids), extracting whatever is present throughout in its entirety to alleviate it and suspending what comes out, while separating any remaining fragments—a treatment process aimed at addressing a tearing issue by removing all associated materials from inside the eyelid for relief. This methodology seems focused on physically intervening within the affected area of concern (the eyes), with careful removal to promote healing or provide symptomatic release, possibly in an era where

Regarding the treatment of this eye condition which occurs in the corner of the eye, here's a translation:
This arises from the eye lid that is called a prolapse (or possibly hernia), and it can be either of its own nature or an accident caused by external factors.
May pain occur accidentally due to maggots or cracks, or from cautery or other similar causes.
The way of the operation is to take a needle in which you make it double-threaded and keep that within the flesh; making it pass from the left tear duct into the right, until the thread reaches the extremities of the body'dicts what appears to be an instruction for suturing or stitching during surgery.
Expose the flesh to the parts above and below it along with that which is in between those areas under pressure; delve into the broad thighs (and also apply this method on their abdomen). And if the shape of the eyelid returns as before, be; otherwise take a sharp tool and pause on that part where it is broken, then convert that area back to its normal form and sew up those eye sockets quickly.

Adjust the separated parts and bring them together with wool thread, taking care of those areas as directed by soothing remedies and poultices within which they are to be healed. (Here 'ajusta' means adjust; this line instructs on repositioning body segments back in place using bandages or similar medical aids; it also emphasizes the application of specific treatments for restoration.)
If there is a tear or need for stitches (or surgical intervention), then cut where the crack appears on the eyelid skin, following whatever has been done previously in that regard. (This line provides guidance on addressing specific types of damage like tears; it advises to proceed with precision as per prior steps taken.)

The taste buds (tongue) are the vessels that go into contact with food and prevent operation in the belly area; they develop over days." This line from a medieval medical treatise describes how, according to ancient beliefs or theories of medicine at the time, taste sensations arise when molecules stimulate these structures. The 'belly' refers historically to where digestion occurs within what modern anatomy would be termed as the
Therefore it is necessary for dining that you take into account if the belly (where digestion occurs) in which there are taste buds is strong and not suffering from another illness than those on the tongue."

If not, then it is in no way an intervention within the body but a reduction of the crack to its shape as per this methodology: and you must recognize either two fine iron or quick-acting medicinal items at hand. If found among these tools (iron or medicine), take according to their form accordingly:

When the hump is at its entirety and does not worsen in adornments nor diminish; as such it follows that one should loosen up the bile, which then ensures good healing afterward—and apply rest over the hump where cuts have been made with surgical intervention for beneficial effect. Further application of compression on top is advisable using liniment composed of acacia and aloe extracts mixed together; additionally, applying strength through an emplastrum topped with fine powder (often pounded semolina) over the hump that has been lifted by manipulation.
The translation of the source sentence line by line into English is as follows:

Eradication of teeth." This phrase likely refers to the complete removal or destruction of one's teeth
"Curing the tooth'dictor of its pain throughout day and night until total eradication; there is no reason that substance should supplement her period when she has been cured, as it resides within which serves for justification in the process of complete removal." This translation suggests a holistic approach where some form of internal remedy or medicine (possibly an elixir) used during and after treatment helps maintain well-being. It implies that once this substance is ingested by someone who has been treated, it supports their health continuously even beyond the point when physical symptoms have subsided following a dental extraction procedure in medieval times. The focus here seems to be not just on immediate relief but also long-term maintenance
When the humors are settled and that tooth which was causing pain has been extracted; you must certify what is actually sick (not just dental issues but potentially other ailments too), for it's necessary not only to cease suffering caused by illness in teeth, now witnesses have seen through our barber surgeons." This translation implies that after the extraction of an obviously painful and problematic tooth – often associated with imbalanced humors or 'black bile,' according to medieval medical beliefs—it is essential for a qualified individual (possibly including those who practiced both minor surgery, like dentistry ('barbies'), and barbering) to confirm the source of pain. Once this diagnosis has been made beyond just the immediate issue with teeth due to excessive black bile or other humoral imbalances causing discomfort elsewhere in the body (evidenced by 'motas veguadas'—recurrent ailments), effective treatments can be administered, thereby ensuring not
So when you need to confirm the source of the pain and understand its nature, immediately lance into the circuit where the tooth meets the jawbone (where any motion can provoke it), ensuring that whatever is within the tooth' extrinsic part has dissolved completely, then apply cold compresses or very fine liniments gradually inside until what caused the issue dissipates.

And whether it is small clots that gradually appear, or if they are strangled inside the mouth so that no bone exits from its cavity; restore the location with appropriate medicine for this issue.
If there is a fracture in the bone, then treat that part of the fracture and its blackness (implying blood), and cure it so that it becomes healed inside.

The treatment of teeth issues is above all for other concerns.
When teeth protrude naturally in their courses and mostly in the hips/hips area, it suggests that one tooth may be missing or absented; hence we deduce this factually if there'thy any other absent tooth as well, then mark such a defect with the form of an instrument—sharp-edged metal from India. It is like cutting pork and sharp iron tools are used for it.
And your incisor is where you place that for up to three days due to the hardness of teeth and it should not be used elsewhere on the teeth.
If there is an emergence of blood from the wound, then apply that same Indian steel sword to stop it.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And all of this is iron from India and Mexico that are brought here; they have sharp points like needles made of these metals, on which a tooth has been cut thinly over several days until ease arrives so no other dent can be ground down or suffer. Return those lines above into the belly (or abdomen), and apply pressure there with fingers of clean hands.
If there is a part that has been dislocated and the tongue protrudes, then you must quickly limit what enters it to prevent its sharpness from causing harm or distortion of speech:

From the restoration of decayed teeth, be it by gold or silver fillings:
When you painfully press on the teeth before contraction and withdrawal through percussion or extraction, and the malady cannot bear weight upon it (which is indicative of dental issues), your medical interventider has treated that with stoppers, but no cure was found for this; hence they will not fall into those which are made from gold teeth/jewelry as silver can be bent and shaped to fit within a few days at most (whereas gold does not change over time).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And according to its subtlety and groove as much as it can enter between teeth; the form of recovery is that you hold the flesh, press twice into healthy teeth on each side (of a wound), and expand towards the twisted part of the flesh found among rotting or multiple parts. Return and apply the poultice inside the area where you started, tightening your hand to ensure it is easy and does not leak.
And it is at which point your strength must hold back the teeth of those bones that you do not want to escape from.
Here comes the sentence to translate: When that urine is brought out with Roman ease.
If it is loosened or untucked, hold on firmly in such a manner throughout all of its time therein.
This is how the teeth and straightness of healthy as well as diseased teeth are linked together at times like these:
When one returns the tooth or applies pressure with any of them in various locations, and they expand as we have recommended, so that it reduces pain.
And only skilled craftsmen and wise ones can do this.

The operation in him is to gargle the malady'thy mouth; his tongue lies within his chest, raise it and inscribe that particular nerve according as your conscience dictates when you lift up one’s own tongue.
May it be that there is hardness or swelling in this area, and it stands due to consolidation of pus within the limits you have divided whereby you split open (or cut) said lump and its associated discharge.
And make sure there is not a crack in the skin of the flesh here, and split asphalt and urine flow forth from it.
Return the skin of incision or any bleeding, and pause briefly with a tongue lick; this is where the blood lingers for some time to prevent it from being reabsorbed during another visit.
May you cool down the inflammation that has been bubbling in the glassware window; may it be if sweat enters and cools there, then purge with a heating needle to remove pus which is directed towards this place where they are gathered. Return that healer for other causes within which it is cured.

This guidance appears related to an emergency dental procedure or direct trauma treatment where moisture (possibly blood) is present and controlled manually by the practitioner. Here they advise a methodical approach, using cotton wool for absorption ('vinegar' may be indicating as both a pause in action due to wind disrupting visibility/communication or literally applying vinegar topically), delicately making cuts where needed and restraining any further bleeding until it ceases. It’s important when translating medical texts, especially from historical periods with different

From the detachment of golden nails and that which nothing remains at the groin, as well as from those other extractions.
When gout attacks occur in the groin and are associated with yellowish teeth that have been discolored by acid, which do not heal when submerged in water as per division instructions, consider whether there is a hard chalk-like apostemy of dark color without much sensation; avoid touching it with iron.
If it is desired for the color and size of the humors to be large, do not touch that with iron due to the flow of blood; leave it inside so that it can mature therein, or if you must move it, then cut through itself (perhaps accidentally).
If it is of white or yellow color, then its humor is subtle; therefore, they believe that the person should be inscribed with it.

And you have placed an incision here according to this method of incising described by the medical practice, and secure the wound with gauze moistened with water.

From the insight of humors when they infiltrate:
When the chest coughs and it becomes prolonged, then it is not vertical (perpendicular); if in the thickness of the body' extruding portion appears round and bulging, then it is called a boil.
When healed, take the water that we have discussed in division and do not hinder your treatment; continue to apply caution with care, and when you insert a cauterizing tool into it (which is round), after inserting it for some time if long or red-brownish like bile of dark color which isn'thy own dimension, take the one that fits in its measurement. For this item fears nothing above where inserted; within there lies no terror over liver area.
When you turn that second sign mentioned by the patient's white and long sickness as directed, whereby you separate the humors (implying an attempt to balance them) within their body using a tool from which they describe how it fits into their nostrthy/belly, pulling one of these instruments inward along with your hand that holds such tools for inspection:
When you do not insert that but the one adjusted to his natural position, if at all it may be inserted into him, then let your speech follow accordingly.
Return the inflammation (referring to "inscizio" which likely means swelling or inflammation), using the water we have prepared within its cavity in two thighs, and take care of that part until it heals.
If the patient's abdomen is terrified by their ignorance of cauterization and the use of caustic in cauterization is merely water, then you stop bleeding from the navel downwards, place your finger on his tongue with the tool we have mentioned earlier, take also a bit of this water for which we spoke at the site of cauterization, hold it alive and carefully fill that hollow part without making it thick or shallow.

If you wish, prick the skin and cover it with medicine, immerse your finger in that same medicinal substance until enough has been absorbed to match what would be used for draping (a technique similar to lancing), then place the ray on top of a tube whereby the flesh adheres through capillary action. Afterward, apply salve as needed if it desiccates and falls off after three or four days.
If you have indigestion and travel through the medicine pathway, repeat that process; apply cauterization within the honey wound border starting from there to begin healing in this water-cleansed area with a poultice of medicinal herbs, and treat it at home using embrocation until recovery.
This remedy is placed with care because of fear and has been applied for a long time.
Some days she is cured by the water that has been applied gently with caustic and incision tools, according to this remedy: rosemary, thyme, sage, rue, Arabian wormwood, chamomile, fennel seeds, mint, and licorice. All these causes or some of them are gathered in a pot and submerged into water; there is poured onto the lid of this vessel an iron ring according to this method: when it's time for treatment, the instrument made from Arabic silver (meaning tongs) rests on top of the said ring. The remedy can consist of either argent or bronze material.

Thus remove any visible humoral substances that are present on the surface above which your tongue indicates there is fluid accumulation (pus) within it: The instruction here seems to advise meticulously cleaning out pus or other discharge from a wound, using one's own saliva as an indicator of where such materials can be seen. It suggests that by observing the reaction on their tongue when touching different areas over which there is fluid accumulation (pus), they will find evidence to confirm what needs cleaning in those particular spots ("la guola" may refer here metapthy
And if there is no appearance and it remains hidden within the joint (presumably referring to pus or another fluid), then take up a mouthful of bile from where food may be fermenting in your stomach; this could indicate what else contributes secretion into that wound. Additionally, bring forth either: May take a snake and bind it with faithful rope, or may place on the table/bed pillows to extract them; alternatively, taking a pot (pottery item) can be used for extraction as well.

When medicine is administered for the worms present in water that we have discussed earlier as part of medical care and are not to be endured, consider then when you desire relief from these pains, apply it directly at the lower abdomen where the illness resides within one's bowels. Ensure that you possess a tool with which this has been prepared for use—typically referred to as an extractor in medical texts or instructions (such as "Capitol" might refer here).
Then if you feel a small or subtle discharge, extract it carefully and with attention.
If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave canula and insert that into the region of the malady, placing a heated iron pin within the concavity of the canula; apply such heat (as long as the patient's humors are dead and held back in the area), preventing them all day from being washed away by water.

The translated sentence in English is: Here they are diverse through their piercing and arrangement themselves (petals), one of which belongs to the specialty of flowers itself, and therefore we extract moisture from them; thus explaining that these plants or organisms require humidity for survival.

This complex passage likely refers to some aspect of botanical physiology—perhaps discussing how certain plants might react differently when damaged in different parts (head vs culmination or juncture) due possibly to their unique anatomical structures designed for specific functions, which can involve operational processes within the plant. The use of "accideys del cos" suggests some interaction with a broader environmental context that could be relevant biologically—potentially involving photosynthesis (if related metap

So other apastes that are dislocated when they're crossed and not mature according to their complements, similar to those naturally found at joints, become prolonged within the belly where it circulates; consequently, rotting ruptures corrupt its ligaments or nerves of that joint. If intervention in such a dislocation occurs beyond its ripened state towards the primary member (the torso), then perforation takes place into which has not matured yet—intervene there promptly to prevent progression within this main body part; and if it concerns the buttocks, pierce where it is immature. This action prevents fecal matter from leaking out and elongates its parts towards the genital segments (anus/vulva), resulting in an abscess or infected swelling that does not heal within this area of origin. May you know when the time for the puncture of the abscess is and so it will be ripe (ready).
You understand that it matures when the pain yields and fever subsides; reduce the speechlessness and heartbeat, strengthen the head of abscessation, and other symptoms.
And when you know where the incision for drainage is located deep in the ulcer and coming from the healing of an abscess,
Here is the line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
When the abscess is in the fleshly part of it, then we must introduce a needle into where such digestion has already advanced two times more (meaning after proper gastric processing), and once done thus; but if you puncture that place now, both extend the wound on the leg and harden and deepen the mouth.
May an aperture be made according to the condition of the flesh or bone where it is necessary, as dictated by which part of the body desires entry (i.dictates). Here's my translation line-by-line:
When administering a small puncture, and large or wide incisions as dictated by the size of the apasts (referring to surgical instruments), then:
Other things come when the cecum is conquered and cut into, where bread comes down as if it were gritty stones or boils (hydromycosis).
From those whom are seated in a section have three angles; and from them is where they sit with the shape of a yew branch, like the pincers of an angle saw.
From them in which it is administered—a round and a crescent shape; they seem similar.
May that person who cannot bear the surface appendages (like splinters or thorns) not be able to endure them if you pierce through such an object at most shallowly.
And when the abscess is large and has collected pus, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; take out some from that place today, and treat the rest tomorrow with larger portions as necessary, following a gradual process until completely removed (drained).
Mostly if the malady is due to cold humor or phlegm in excess (from a sick woman, young girl, child, or old decrepit person), as their spirit moves towards expulsion of illness, and they soon depart with the disease, then you operate on them.
1. Guard thy great care, and place your incisions where you pierce these thorns; be wary that no plagues arise therein, and consider whether the pus of the thorn is scanty or a flat slice, then attend to it with whatsothy may have had before thee; if indeed the thorn great, and its fissures motesome, cover thou thy meatus in every disruption that comes between us.
If in the abscess it has detached a part of the colon or you have hollowed that out within the circuit, then cover it with cloth soaked in wine vinegar as soon as you carry pans or small containers holding them; and tighten this up every third day due to its moisture content. And thus apply treatment for what has come from inside these bandages while they are healing.
If you encounter bleeding during your operation, then administer cold water and compresses in the places where blood flows more abundantly; place one of these compresses over the area of flowing blood to control it.
May if the flow of blood continues, then take care with your regimen and treatment; use what I recommend here in these pages for maintenance and division.
If it is winter time and the place of ulceration is where nerves are located, then cover them with crumbs or oil poured on a healing tool (cautery) and rest those upon the places.
If it is summer and the locations are fleshy, then when you rest pills at the beginning of the day in water and oil, as we have mentioned beforehand, this will enter into your body until the freshest part of the day; moreover, when you cut away the aposteme (infection) and cleanse it out with what is necessary for its treatment inside that patient.

According to the color of one's body and its essence is like a seed; it can be consumed with water in greater or lesser amounts—two kinds (four if including variations), fats, containing moisture as clouds according to your dietary intake. Here 'comensament de lu,' meaning the substance of one's food and drink ('lu'), is likened metaphorically with seeds that absorb water ("vace"), suggesting how different types (fat/oil or other fats) contribute to body humidity, which can be reflected in bodily fluids. Here 'color del cors,' likely refers to the overall complexion of one's body and its relation to dietary intake ('comensament').
So then, when you reach the stage of healing this node that is being expelled and inquire about what it implores for strength during its return to form as indicated here, insert yourself accordingly according to where it will appear at the head which I have noted down above.

Based on your request and considering the context of medieval medical texts, which often blend Latin with regional vernac0rlex
The eminence of the navel is painful due to movements causing fractures in which part; or because of tears where blood vessels or ligaments are torn as a result from other ruptures - either through direct damage here described, or caused by constriction leading into these areas. This indicates that joint and organ injuries can lead to referred pains at the navel area due to disrugy in internal structures such as vasculature (blood vessels) or connective tissues like ligaments during stressful movements causing tears ("ruptures").
If there is a tear in the cistern and of the fabric (possibly referring to issues within body fluids or structures), then the appearance of inflammation seems similar to that of the limb; it hurts like a lion, which appears differently depending on various situations. If it is for the discharge of the hernia (budel), then after recalling what we have noted about that which has come out, with great intensity difference, and once you understand this aspect, return; immediately so he will be well again, and his health greatly improved by strong baths and vigorous exercise.
If it is due to moisture, then you are like a lion and will not be hidden when I place my hand on your body; nor constrained, nor compressed.
If it is sickness (presumably of some nature), then at these times you will see ulcers appearing on the blackened areas.
May it be for flesh nothing grave, hard and long lasting; then he is bound after a certain quantity.
If it is due to wind movement, then touching him with your hand becomes a lion.
And when the operation on him is considered if his navel'se eminentence (believed to be a spine or vein) is due to worms, breeching, it becomes clear that those things which are forbidden in healing should concern you. Here one learns from teaching at the head where I have previously mentioned methods of treatment using arsenic and venesection (bloodletting).
If the prominency of the navel is due to the intestine or fabric, then order the bowels so that they retain its place and remain extended; similarly command throughout all parts around the belly button where you have placed a cushion, placing yourself between your thighs above it. Also circle the space within which the protrusion occurs in the circuit of the navel to ensure proper positioning for those areas – enclosing large hernias with fabric or strong thread (or line). And raise the tentacle of the apendicectomy and place yourself between your thighs above it, ensuring control over the appendix by means of a firm rope.

If you have torn the fabric (the skin), then take that one with your fingers; and cut off its excesses from it.

If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them into where it pierces and extends the flesh; when they are subtly inserted and penetrated by themselves, take care of that which comes out from within the wax (which is used for enwrapping), as this will be healed.
If the swelling of the navel is due to meat nothing or moisture in it, then you must cover it with bread and water as provided herein, which removes humidity from within, thus curing the ulceration (swelling), and taking care that what covers and consolidates this place.

In the adhesion of the penis (and this adherence is not due to decay but where it attaches, and over here there's no need for circumcision; when you scrape off adhesions dissolved by spongy stones that have detached from underneath or caused inflammation) cover with a blunt stone so the head of urethra can be removed in its entirety. ("This line guides practitioners on how to remove an obstruction, which may involve scraping off obstructions made by hardened stones and then using tools like spongy or rounded instruments for removal.)

The refinement and care for the young ones who have undergone circumcision.
Circumcision is not a solution for continuity with other illnesses: however, when it comes from our operation and intention, and concerning those issues specifically in children, we must assign them to the better treatment course using milder means of healing.
So it is said that ancient people did not perform circumcision around the time of freedom, and they do not use them in their laws, only having acquired this practice through experimentation. This causes much suffering among craftsmen and barbers who now resort to using thread made from silk or wool as new razors (clippers) and scissors for shaving; employing leather thongs and sharp nails held by the claw of a bird, which inflicts great pain.
E you have already tried all these methods and found no better improvement than with the knife or thread in waxing within unguentum (ointment), where motions escape from below, flee downward through the penis sheath when it is covered by two tunics, rise again temporarily as a distended tumor above them both, and thus you are forced to seek another understanding and pain relief. E arises the purification of which it is felt due to alchemical actions and from the digit, by means of these instruments used by physicians; however, this does not securely protect the extremity of the male member as long as it remains within its breech (the anal region).

May the world-making that is done with nails and threads be of good quality as I have experienced them; for when these materials are proportionate like their sharpness today, thus also will you match two degrees of hardness in my hand, examining each according to a comparison at one time. And so it becomes clear correction or shaping the shape of the nail on its own form contains all fingers without error—the whole length of which I have measured with these instruments myself.
And the first reason for surgery is that you should make the child majorly if they are of those who understand a little and do not perform anything else but place your faith in their cravow just enough, allowing them to return tomorrow.
Return that joy throughout all of your intelligence, which is within your reach for comprehension and acceptance. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

In the communion is a place where it is gathered and its second quantity that rises from there; when any cause draws this away, then it's drawn back here too, and when expelled far, as long as until clamping occurs at which point naphtha appears in sea battles.
Therefore, when you wish to prevent moisture in the bladder, insert the extremity of clacking into the moisture, and draw it out towards that water which pushes against the parts below, where the moisture is drawn upwards into the cavity of the clacker.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return the exterior of the thigh within the groin according to what we have recommended in the urinary bladder; and propel the moisture you are propelling, which will ascend into the upper part of the bladder, where it belongs.
The form of which bladder is constricted, and this is its shape.
When it is of silver or alloyed material (such as small feather-like appearance), and then insert the thread into his limb(s).
Return the bladder to its motion, and pause there where moisture wants to crystallize in the bladder; place it between two well-tied bands of flesh, so that this moisture may be scalded over the focus.
Return (or adjust) the limb of the patient into its cavity, and place your hand on it so that the limb does not protrude outwardly in agony or sw
Then place your hand on the bladder due to the moisture that has entered through the hernia within this waist area where such moisture is now present in distress or swelling of the urinary bladder. (This translation attempts to convey a medieval medical context, suggesting an intervention for suspected involvement between a protruding organ and excessive humidity leading to discomfort.)
If there is no bladder present, then take a pillow made of peacock feathers and pierce the entire circumference; insert it firmly into those disrusetup structures so that they are disturbed in their position; place your hand above these areas whereupon you wish to move them. Also bring another cushion or water as if attending directly to moisture, resting there until such fluid is expelled (this translation suggests a treatment method for dealing with protrusions and associated fluids without direct reference to the bladder).
Here comes the line to translate: Return your tool there and make it touch that which you have touched in the bladder area, expressing with your hand where moisture is expected to reach the bladder.
The provided text appears to be written in an archaic form of Romance
From stone." This line suggests that something (potentially a procedure or tool) is being extracted
"We have already divided the stones and cured them in our medicine practices, and discussed the properties of that." This translation indicates a discussion or observation about categorizing different types of kidney (vesicular) stones versus ureteral stones within their medical treatment contexts; it implies an understanding of these conditions' characteristics for proper management.
"We have discussed the stone in which this operation is performed and sectioned." Here again we find a reflection on medical intervention – likely nephrolithotomy (kidney stone removal surgery) or similar procedure
"The kidney-derived stone is precisely that which resides in the bladder." This clarifies a medical understanding relevant to treatment: The origin and current location of certain stones – specifically, those formed within the kidneys (vesicular) are noted as being
"They recount that which is shown here in detail." This line suggests a report or account of medical findings, possibly from an examination or study session; it implies comprehensive and concise
"Therefore say that kidney stones mainly affect children; and the excretions of urine from it resemble water in their subtlety, appear therein (likely within a metaphorical or poetic context), where mucus flows like veils around them. They are then dressed at these forums with beads made from those very stones." This passage appears to blend medical descriptions of kidney stones – particularly in children and their excretions, which the author likens subtly resembling water ("in its delicacy") within some setting or forum (perhaps a healing environment). The subsequent actions involving "mucus veils" suggest an almost ritualistic preparation for these urinary byproducts using stones transformed into jewelry, possibly symbolizing purification through their crafting.
And it is when cleanlinthy care of children within that age, having reached twelve years old, becomes difficult in the limbs. May in young people move through those waters that flow between them.
From that from which the stone is larger and poultice applied lighter; if it's scarce, contrary to it.
Therefore, when approaching the treatment of that, cover with a cloth from above where it exits through the hole which is entirely within their bands; this very same hole for some time has prohibited the infusion of venom into its depths, awaiting further inquiry.
Here is the line-by-line translation:
Return that which you have prepared among yourselves, and the things of yours are now done in turns, so that the bladder as a whole is reduced towards the divisions quickly.
Return that which has been taken out of there (the body), all of it back into place.
So if you feel pain in the area, then gently place your hand over it there.
If you have not yet touched the entire body according to what is indicated for the left side when there is a malady in the belly (indicating pregnancy), or as per the directive if one has completed puberty, then touch that which is directed and place it inside the patient'dict lower region. Through a finger inserted that is inside already there sits the urine. When that little one goes into the neck of the bladder.
When you press upon that limb which they give herein, and remove it from the parts beyond this place where their section is located.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return it back into its place, as this is how they enter: And divide the water between the knee and thighs without going into the belly of the left thigh; place a section over that stone in the groin (the abdomen), where this same section is across, so that it becomes wide and spread out according to how much there is on that stone, but not more than what can fit between the body part underne énce and the belly. And since a hole may be present at times in those places (in which case they refer specifically to potential hernias), this means you cannot forcefully remove it with whatever tool is currently inside that area of discomfort, where there might already be an issue like protruding tissue or swelling contained within.
Be aware that there is some stone within which the joints and edges are located, making it difficult to clean them with water.
From that fluid it appears like a lion and is round, made of urine used for medicine preparation.
So if it is that which has been angled or stretched outwards, adjust within the crack.
If there is not a catheter inserted (foregoing "foro-getada"), then you must care for that area or the one where pressure has been applied, and do so with a limestone tool on the bone where compression occurs; do not avoid doing this at once. Or insert immediately an instrument of subtle curvature undernethy's extremity (hand).
May you not be able to hold onto that, then increase the wound a little bit, and if you see outflow of pus, remove it carefully with sulphuric acid that has been previously concentrated (vitriol).
If the patient has only one kidney remaining, then draw it into the bladder mouth and place your hand over this area; also carry another small amount to this point; apparently these are drops of bile from disease.
If the patient has much pain, it is ignorance on your part to insert that large section deep within them, for one of two causes: either they are already dwelling there due to continuous urine distillation, and thus the location cannot be fully secured.
When treatment of the patient is inside out or during a bone fracture where tools (forceps) are used within to extract that which has come out, it means:
So when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with Aloe and dragon'sup sap, and tightly bind it up. And when poultice is applied over that cloth steeped in oil and wine (or vinegar mixed with water), to ensure the application bites into place firmly.
Return the bladder above the spine and do not release the ligament inside until the third day.
When that breeze enters, apply water and oil to the spot where it is applied with liniment or unguent until healed.
May you apply poultice if the wound is inflamed and decayed, similar to when your bladder is frozen within it, for then urine is prohibited (and this exacerbates as long as the body expels its contents), thus interpose a cloth in the child and extract that very same one, provided doing so provokes further deterioration of the bladder.
Here applies water and salt, against all kinds of special substances that are needed for healing within which the patient has been cured.
In the hours of total care where you have both thighs and adjust the medicines that are paused over the place,
If the stone is small and located in the bladder, and it remains therein, then urination of this kind (stone passage) should be prohibited; hence those who come to a section due to excessive water intake are often accused of passing stones; you have already drained the fluid, now grasp for an iron implement with which this is done:
From outside the cavity, gout is lodged in a pipe.
When one is in bed, and it's time for that particular leg or foot bladder to be emptied into the urinary vessel such that it does not return there again.
Return the iron into the wound with ease while ensuring that the puncture tool enters the depth of the hole created by it. Revolve the cautery in your hand slowly within that small stone, and insert it until one from the other reaches to perforate; thereafter the urine is expelled.
Here is the line by line translation:
If this cure is not for you due to any reason that prevents it from being used by you now, then apply a poultice quickly on the skin, and another poultice below the skin. Translation of each line into English: Return that which has been taken out (or extracted). In restoring ligaments and sanctioning hardened joints (which is done in the open air).
It is not necessary to use hemp rope here immediately after removal of the belt from the waist, but rather for prevention that it returns to its place; another bandage above when removing the hemp, then once removed this will return to its original position and catches whatever remains.
When it is necessary for you to lift the leg under (which likely refers to lifting or supporting an injured limb), then raise your belt above those parts below, and take back what belongs to each of them as they have said when we talked about this together.

The translation of the Latin text snippet is: "If any stone (or perhaps 'peyra' here refers metaphorically or historically to a medical issue) from them arises, it is difficult to cure and its removal by hands is prohibited." This suggests that in this historical context, self-removal of what may have been perceived as an internal growth (symbolized by
The translated line from the medieval Latin medical treatise reads: "One among them is considered very large for a woman." This indicates that, historically, certain physical standards were expected
The translation of the Latin text fragment is: "Another one does not find a woman who can extract herself if she goes to the doctor when it appears or belongs to women with child." This implies that there was historically some expectation for self-removal under specific circumstances, and professional medical help might be sought only upon certain conditions being met. The mention of extraction in relation to "femnas haventz maritz
The translated Latin sentence is: "A third one does not handle women who know this art, primarily the operation." This indicates that there was a recognition of specific skills or knowledge required for handling such cases ("this art") and suggests surgery might often be involved in these procedures during medieval times
The translation of the Latin text is: "A fourth one states that the location of the stone in a woman'thy body exceeds its own place; hence an urgent operation must come first." This line suggests there was concern and recognition for immediate medical action, likely surgical intervention ("urgent operation"), to address such conditions. The implication is clear that these situations were taken seriously enough by those with the knowledge or authority at the time (as indicated by "preonda").
If it is necessary for you to cause expulsion towards the water (likely referring here as some form of treatment or medication), then take hold of a female midwife'softhe knowledgeable one and do so gently without much effort.
If you lack it, seek out a skilled midwife or woman trained in the care of women' extradition:
So take that present now, and command the patient to bind all of what you are giving them, from inquisition about the stone up until feeding; this causes concern if the woman is virginal or desires her dress at the entrance of her body - where she intends for it.
Then if it hurts that part, press firmly on it quickly and command them (the patient) to lie down on that spot.
If there is no vein visible, then the matron commands that her servant insert it into the cavity of the malady and place it on the bladder; thus preventing their left hand from resting upon the urinary bladder, while they acquire a good cautery.
So if it causes agony, then the one who is gradually worsening that which torments in the bladder to the parts of his body within as quickly as possible must arrive at the hollowness of the hip joints where such pain originates from so they can begin treatment.
And place it submerged in that position on the bed where any swelling of the groin may occur when standing and center the penis there; this should not be displaced from its location by quick movements.
E the section is small for consumption; and place your hand over that portion of it according to the quantity by which you know the flesh has been pierced therefrom.
Be aware that the stones of pepper are grains: some few and large, like lion or sharp asspire, elongated and round, with rims (probably referring to their shape).
Thus you know how many spices are needed for what I indicate, which will come forth.
If you see flux of phlegm present, adjust it in the glass vessel that has been thrice boiled and place your hand therein for an hour until the phlegm is discharged, then return to your operation within which time the pus should be expelled.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you see a flow of phlegm and know that the expulsion of phlegm is from uncured inflammation, then place powder over the location and apply this to relieve coughing and tightness without further intervention; do not remove what has come out, for it may lead to recovery. Return care for the child (or patient). Here "aprop" is likely an arch
So when the sharpness of pain decreases day by day, it moves (the patient'thy condition), and thus you should return to your work within such time that flesh is healed. Here "aprop cura" suggests returning care or attention ("retorna a la operacio") as soon as there has been an improvement in the sharpness of pain indicating possible wound cleaning, dressing changes required for proper healing (whenever the skin overlying the affected area needs to be redressed), hence "la peyra sia fora-getada.
In Chapter LXII: Here we continue with a translation into English, although
Regarding the section on hernias (or protrusions): In this chapter, there is likely
A hernia is not simply an accumulation of moisture in the bladder (where urine resides), which causes a pulling on the intestines containing fluid within them; hence they are named 'bladders.' Here, "ayguoza" likely refers to something having come or entered into ("nos manteca"), possibly indicating an abnormal accumulation of moisture in this context. The term for bladder here is rendered as a Latin-influenced equivalent
There are some signs within the peritoneum (the serous membrane lining of the abdominal cavity), where nature takes its course with urine in preparation for elimination; and this is between the bladder, which has already been mentioned ('a lu preparec natura'), as well as other fluid contents within. Here 'tart' refers to something that retains or holds firmly ("no es aquo" implying not being water), possibly indicating a non-liquid residue in addition to the urine (fluid) already present between these structures, perhaps suggesting old blood clots after hemorrhage which have set and are no longer liquid. The term '
The generation of this hernia is through purge which occurs in the kidnelauses, so that these materials come out from them, and some are expelled by striking points on the kidney area itself:

Here comes the first source sentence translated into English: And for these sinews with which this addition of water is associated herein: if it in the white cistern that we have mentioned beforehand, then healing occurs gradually over a long bath taking shape like hair, and appears the genitalia; as humidity accounts throughout all.
If the fluid is in the patient's pancreas, then an abscess forms there and as soon as it comes out, he considers that another organ has ruptured.
If there is moisture between the navel and the white line of the belly button (the umbilicus), then apply pressure to that area immediately.
When you wish to ascertain the color of humidity, look for its presence in the swelling where it preceded; and if it appears on the limb'supremacy thereof, then examine what has entered into that body which was already disturbed by this condition.
So when we come to the care of him who is ill with it (the metal humors), if you can command the humor that has become fluidic in his body, then perform an enema on him at your discretion.
Return its position on top of any cause or two causes at once and pause occasionally with the changing sheets immediately afterward.
Put it on the left side of him/her and command the servant to follow his/her right side; he will stretch out their arm up two hands from under the neck down to the waist, where they divide into legs and abdomen parts.
Return the pillow or splint back into its cavity, and place it inside along the length of the bed to which you have locked your patient's neck (or spine).
And if it is the second section retracted by hand away from the line where one'thy knee should be, then arrives at the spot understood by those who are adept in this art with knowledge of bones and joints (the chest area).
Excise that, and observe it carefully so you do not reinsert it; your excision is what allows this part to remain suspended above the belly at times and subtly inspects according to what can be observed in the excision itself.
When puncturing the bladder of water with an enlarged hole (large forearm incision), remove all the water.
Return the separation between the labia of one section and not touching the cautery on the areas below; do not handle the instruments in that manner which is within your capability. Here enters within it all or in pads, and mostly its subtle part; if you do not examine meticulously the inner workings of him/her, there is no guarantee that water will not return.
If during that part of your operation concerning the area above her navel, you have completed the section involving the cleft (nipple), then return it to its place and adjust the lips of the navel of a newborn with sutures therein; take care for them as if they were other creatures.
If you have corrupted the humors through another illness, then it is necessary that you remove them using the vessels they are drawn into and extract the humor, taking care of what we previously mentioned.
May if water is added to any parts of the body, you will understand that these are hernias; therefore, incise in that part which has already been cut elsewhere on your abdomen; and if it's an operation for you, then perform it.
Return the intestine to its cavity, and place your hand over it in cloth soaked with oil or ointment; apply another piece of this wet linen that you have submerged in wine and oil, expanding it between two knees under the belly; pause thereover drenched sheets folded into pills, binding these together as follows:
And lay two pressed sheets and woolen rolls according to this likeness; they are bandages for the extremities that you must bind or wet with moisture, and arranged in pleats on the apron of their petticoats, one thigh binding at the waist, another leg tuck into the parting of the gown, two more around each hip joints, and all bandaging is adjusted to fit within the petticoat.
And in some treatments this hernia is artificially reduced at the site of excision with a fine cautery that you hold undernethy's urethra (the penile tube), and when it has been found that there is a white bladder containing water inside, then take up these same thin cauteries as follows: And it is brought together in Greek letters.
When it is necessary to make holes in that area of the spleen, and then everything inside there will be expelled outwardly.
Return the sinew that is cut, and burn it with fine flame; inspect as soon as you can what remains of your patient within reach so that everything may be eradicated from him; keep watch lest the fire touch his mouth.
Be aware that this operation is safe and prevents excess fluid flow in the veins, which is better than an incision.
May it happen that in the time of dressing or during treatment, if you encounter an abscess requiring drainage (cauterization), which discomfort is related to what I'm treating for, then attend immediately as directed hereafter.
If the abdomen is painful and there'sin hope for a second operation due to its horror, administer an incision as you are directed; when it has been certified that this (the presence of) a hernia is evident from what we have said about its signs, then do so accordingly.
When you make an incision in the spleen above any raised joint area (implying a humoral imbalance), pierce through the apendicitis at its lower part near the spine, and stop the puncture according to the length of the body.
When I have opened wide for the flow of water throughout it all.
Return your pause over the place where it touches and hold that one there while holding another for him to prevent his body from getting wet by water. Return that which is within so as it may be healed by care.
May it happen that opposition occurs to the water element at that time when you pierce through this: and then it is not pain but clear watery fluid in its womb, causing contrary action which prevents medical treatment of the water from being administered, whereupon what has been extracted by means thereof (likely pus or some other material), such as precedes that form; at this juncture adjust a small item within it.

You understand that fear of loss is present over this hernia, so it'dicted the discharge and thus saved by virtue of her superiority in such matters; as seen to me now its release and my salvation through her merit.
You already remember the operation in that place with those tools of insertion.
So say that the inflammation occurs in the joints where muscles are attached and become swolthy due to various causes: either from acute excess, which bursts into these areas of muscle attachment, or through impact/strike.
It is according to the body'se colour that a fracture occurs and does not aggravate pain therein; it is severe.
When it is blackened like lead without center in sight,
And sometimes pain is caused by the knotting of tendons and inflammation of those joints where it has already been noticed, or due to swelling of veins.
May it be known that when there is an inflammation of the joints, this condition can come about due to arthritis upon discontinuing treatment, and one must not touch it.
May that which is pain due to an inflammation of the vein not be dispersed by this pressure, and should it require compression on those points (presumably where they have applied for relief).
Here comes the first source sentence: And it is possible that this special effect occurs over these bones; and you insert your finger into the urethra, placing them below the divisions above, extracting what' extricates from the white cyst of course partitions, disrupting suspenders for veins, binding together those threads whereupon extraction is made.
So if it's already there in those meats, then take out what is within and insert that back again.
If there is an attachment within any cause of the chest or between the breasts (which are referred to as "bayssels" in medieval terminology), then you must release all that attachment and clean it out using round instruments.
May it be that the natural meat in the place behind (possibly referring to a specific body part being examined or treated), and if so you insert all of what is there from your hands, and extract them together with us as we have done.
So when your operation is complete, fill it with rosemary oil and vinegar; care for that which has been healed by another remedy within.

And that which you fixate upon the womb with an awl on elevated scrap (possibly as part of surgical intervention); and adjust the suspenders attached to the testicles at their joints; and bring into place those other ministerial items, your gloves—extend them vigorously: This line from the medieval medical treatise appears to describe a procedure or treatment involving direct manipulation with precision (using an awl), possibly for surgical purposes like setting up hernia repairs. The mention of "suspenders attached to testicles" could refer to ligaments, and their adjustment might be part of the correction process. Additionally, gloves are mentioned as items that should also be extended vigorously—perhaps indicating caution or thorough handling during a procedure: In summary, this passage outlines specific actions taken with medical instruments (like an awl) for correcting issues related to hernias and testicles in the medieval context.
Return and insert an iron spear through one section across the middle of your body, where the vessels have been discovered within that space.

In this line, it seems like we are dealing with instructions or notes regarding the treatment of an intestinal prolapse
The appearance of this hernia is due to a section that extends outwards from the belly caused by weaknesses in the intestinal walls ("angunars del mirac"), leading to protrusions or bulges near those areas where ruptures have occurred. In simpler terms, it describes how an internal organs (possibly parts of the bowel) pushed through a defective area within the abdominal wall can result in what is described as herniation—a medical condition that requires attention and treatment to prevent further complications or damage.
This rupture can be of the abdominal wall or from excretion (perhaps referring to a blockage), and these organs are subjected by various reasons: trauma ("traumat" meaning injury which could imply physical violence, impacts that may cause internal damage such as hernias); pressing; coughing forces; lifting heavy objects causing strain or pressure – all of which can lead to the weakening and potential tearing (rupture) of abdominal wall structures. This explanation further clarifies how lifestyle factors, certain activities, even stress ("clamor" also means noise here but could imply general discomfort), along with predisposing conditions like
The belch (likely referring to vomit in this context) when it comes from the abdominal wall due to strain does not cause immediate discomfort, but rather a gradual weakening and potential formation of hernias inside; over time these internal problems may manifest as bulges or protrusions through defects (holes or tears) in the walls surrounding organs within this cavity. This line suggests that certain symptoms like belching could be indicative of an underlying issue related to abdominal wall integrity and might lead, over time without proper care ("pauc a pauc"), eventually causing problems with hernias due to pressure or other factors
When the patient' extricates from their seat or chair (seccio del ciphac), suddenly intense pain occurs; various symptoms appear on the seemingly healthy side of the hip joint, and it is due to discharge from the entrails/gut (budel) that affects different parts farthest in the body.

There is not a single hereditary cause of the stones in their own lineage; and if there were some present within it, they are few as butterfs upon water—and these can return throughout all hours or periods without any specific triggering events known to them at this time.

If the time for excretion of stones is prolonged within their bladder (the cystic space), it necessitates that we address any fissures present inside this area and pass a stone therein; furthermore, acidity from extended holding in these urinary deposits worsens the condition by extending the scope where they are held. This is likely referring to kidney stones or bladder stones causing blockages (extendments) within their cystic system—the space usually used for storage of fluid and waste products filtered out by the body's organs, hereby necessitating medical attention not only for pain relief but also intervention strategies. Here they describe a situation where if left untreated or withholding treatment (not passing stones), it can further irritate and exacerbate their condition within these storage areas while emphasizing the need to address both symptoms—pain, likely from stone presence causing obstruction in urine flow/storage.

This line reflects traditional approaches where manual massage or other forms of gentle stimulation were believed to promote health within men's reproductive system by targeting the scrotum specifically—an example being how care was taken over these
Therefore they are brought near that which is required for the care of this person who massages his scrotum, and in doing so encapsulate entirely within it—the part softened as mentioned previously; with two lips properly adjusted to aid in its treatment. Here we see a meticulous approach where specific body parts like labia are carefully manipulated (potentially through self-manipulation or by another person) alongside the massage of the scrotum, indicating an attention to detail and possibly therapeutic intent within historical medical praxis for addressing issues related to male reproductive health. The text suggests a practice that combines physical engagement with specific body parts while aiming at healing or maintaining
If you wish to discuss it further in the meal (which might be a euphemism for sexual intercourse), then there are three or four cookings of this scrotum-softened area involved, and with strong stitches made; indicating that not only is their therapeutic intent but also perhaps an understanding within these ancient texts about the potential effects (both positive in terms

Translation: You know that castration is forbidden by our law; however, I remember this in the current text and there's no need to dwell on it further unless for two reasons related to medical practice as understood today—the first being when we discuss these matters with a healer during treatment. The second reason prompting us here might be due to necessity regarding castrations of other animals, much like horses or dogs if needed, and porkers (young male pigs) for consumption purposes; just as it is done today concerning movement restraints using leashes on these creatures, even including the use of muzzles.
So it is said that gonorrhea occurs in two ways: either through withdrawal or due to the rupture of a segment.

From the treatment of leprosy (or Hansen's disease). The phrase suggests a discussion in medieval times
Leprosy in men is said to have two types according to the symptoms: one where it appears as water that fills up space within the scrotum, and another manifestation between the testicles featuring a hair resembling female bodyhair. Here medieval practitioners are describing different presentations of leprosy based on its physical signs—a reflection of medical observations from their time with terminology tied to both physiological structures (testes) and gender-specific features like pubic or facial/body hair, which were believed linked to health conditions.
There are also warnings from that urine contained within the scrotum. This line could indicate a traditional belief in medieval medicine regarding diagnostic symptoms or prognostics, suggesting an observation linking body waste products (urine) to diseases
In women, it is special: for this reason, the condyle of the female pelvis can be placed between two male scrotums with little effort and on top of that menstrual flow from a woman may occur together like urine from males along with semen during intercourse. This line indicates an understanding—or perhaps speculation within medieval medical thought—of reproductive health, highlighting how body fluids are compared across genders (menstruation likened to the ejaculate of men), and potentially implying a belief in shared physiological processes or even bodily influences between sexes. This reflects an aspect of gender perception within medical practice during that era—
The treatment involves three species, two from men and one specific to women. This line suggests a multifaceted approach in medieval medicine that acknowledges the importance of understanding gender-specific treatments—indicating knowledge about different remedies or inter Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And that you insert those bones adjusted into where it escapes from there, and treat other illnesses as well.

It also suggests gender-specific implications and involvement in these conditions through activities such as sex, which could potentially spread or worsen the lentigo among women more than men due to their role within it (as per traditional views on female sexuality).

This part of the text appears to advise that if joint pain or arthritis symptoms are due to dietary indiscretion like excessive meat intake ("carn nada ajustada") and rich foods, then it is important not only to avoid these but also certain practices such as overeating (implied by "enfantament" which might refer to feasting or indulgence) and possibly other unspecified actions. The text likely advises against excessive consumption ("prohibeys de cuoyt") associated with eating beyond one's means, leading back in the body like indigestion (implied by "sobra" meaning leftover), suggesting a holistic approach to
The text here discusses the diagnosis of a condition ("cognicio") in terms of dietary habits and possibly related health issues like excessive eating or feasting, as suggested by "oppilacio." If such symptoms are apparent (visible), then prevention through careful monitoring is recommended. However, if these signs are not obvious to the untrained eye ("no es evident"), a closer examination of tendons and ligaments may be necessary for diagnosis or guidance on treatment options — possibly referring back again to "les tieus ditz" (perhaps meaning

The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise discussing
It seems that the line you've quoted is in Italian and relates to puncture wounds of appendicitis (appendicitis) occurring in a woman (
The Italian line describes various complications associated with appendicitis in women, including abscesses and perforations (ruptures), ulcers/lesions of erosive nature ("ulceracios"), fistulas from leaking or infected areas within the abdomen ("emorroyas e raguarrias" meaning bleeding into surrounding tissues due to a ruptured appendix, which could lead to infection spreading). It also mentions "thyl," which is likely referring to thrombosis (blood clots), and other possible complications like the formation of abscesses or fistulas ("ap The Italian text here refers to the diagnosis of these various conditions and complications (like abscesses, perforations, ulcers) that women with appendicitis might experience ("these maladies" referring back to those mentioned earlier). It also touches on treatments for both their symptoms and specific lesions/wounds related to the condition. The text emphasizes considering these aspects in medical
This Italian line discusses the context within which appendicitis wounds should be cauterized (coagulated), hinting at a therapeutic procedure for such conditions in women ("in this tractate of apendicular lesions"). It then inquires about whether one wants to know how these procedures are performed using iron-based tools, suggesting that specific medical methods or instruments were used historically.
And when you consider that the pain from penetration in their abdomen is sharp and stabbing, accompanied by fever and inflammation, touch them gently if they are conscious about it; but do not press down on such a patient lest there be perforation. Treat this with whatever helps until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
And when you make circles on the woman' extrices (someone who practices medicine), place her on a couch that she provides; adjust their shoulders to the back part of the stomach just slightly away from it, spread out their hips, and pause briefly between each breath they take with inhalation. Here is the translation line by line:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And place the matron over straight and direct manner using the tool with which she opened (the patient), as this form will bring about what needs to be done.
When you are about to administer this tool on the lady'thy breast and ensure that nothing from the tool enters her uterus except for its tip, touching it lightly against her chest. If the tool is larger than the patient's marrow, then you must pause on its texture with your fingers so that no part of it enters into the bone of the mother.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When you pause the current that flows through the tool under your left hand, and hold with a glove what is in charge of this instrument; turn around within which it has overflowed into its moisture (the patient'dict).
When excitement appears and it touches the hand and foot, causing them swelling like a lioness with moisture in its paw (the heel), cover that area immediately with your palm under the arch of the foot to prevent excessive inflammation.
When the illness is expelled, then you should pause in mud or oil immersed wherein there be any spotting; and apply it to the portion before Mother'thy daybreak.

In the context provided, it seems that there may have been a typographical error or an attempt to use archaic language mixing different linguistic influences (Latinate with elements of Italian/Spanish). Assuming these terms were meant for teaching midwives how births are perceived when they occur in non-natural settings:
Necessary is that the matron caresses her child'thy figure at meals and when she expresses desire to smell air around her, it leads away moisture from above her head where there is humidity present; be mindful that this part is a second natural figure, its purification occurs on one's own head while the secondary female (possibly referring to another woman or servant) hangs suspended at the belly button.
So when you lift those legs, make sure the patient's stomach is compressed so that their unborn child won't move whenever they lie on their head; at this time, give them a second pillow and remove any excess by using proper purification methods for cleaning.
May that which is not natural and untreatable occur when you are ill at ease upon your feet and the head of yourself comes forward along with its own weight down to your pelvis or chest; there, pressing on one's backbone until it becomes like one’thy body. Such figures look foreign and incomprehensible within oneself.
When necessary, it is for the midwife who must be wise and subtle in all these matters, and guard against errors and deceit.
When you show them their entire figure in those things, and with that intention they are represented therein for the doctors' understanding to be clear on what is shown upon it over water.
When the joint is hurting on top of their head naturally and it' extricably affects the female part as well, sometimes that very woman also feels weakened and drained due to black pepper poultice and other herbs they possess.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return the metronome between your fingers and in that place it enters where moisture is present due to its wetness, or take hold of one for itself so that this fluid remains within it. Precede gently pressing the woman'dict belly so that childbirth can occur.
If not done otherwise, then cover the woman with mucciale of silk and fennel (muccella di mais), which will be bandaged on her chest.
Here comes the command to him/her (or "to you"), take control of his chest and apply that soothing massage he'thy needs; put your mouth on his nose and lips for an hour until it feels as if they have gone through a thorough examination there.
If the greater parts of the belly are opened during consumption (possibly referring to eating or digestion), then you must gently reduce those swolthy areas, little by little. If the patient does not obey internally (likely referring to following medical advice or treatment), then:
If the masses are not turned inwards and fall down, then you must inspect those areas and remove them from undernethy drape or clothing equally distributed among all parts of their body; this is necessary to address it.
When the belly is above the feet, it follows that you push those upwards and make them small, and warm their stomachs with your hands, gently squeezing each one of them little by little.
When he is inside the thighs, then you command him to express himself, and make that rupture as if God will.
If there is not enough water that we have given to treat the patient, then return the small fetus gradually within while keeping pace with its second figure of nature; this will help restore balance (or "leugier"), which in turn benefits healing ("eyssiment").
If it is forbidden to have all the fluid that we recommend, then take muscle of high and softened gum dissolved in water, beat them thoroughly in the mortar for good percussion, apply lines of this liquid woman (fluid), which comes from below her belly, and pus coming from inside her abdomen. Return that part of it into water immersion, so as to obtain relief for the epicondyles (epiphyses).
When parts previously detached come together and are subjected to the steam of mint and applied pressure over that area for them: When you submerge the patient in a bath of cold treatment for an hour, then make them sit on a cushion, and raise their sternum extension while pressing down below it with pressure from there—as soon as they enter that position, if done correctly, they feel relief.
Eye examination is regularly performed with one of its fingers. When she is reduced in her size, if you cannot perform that reduction yourself, then lift the woman and carry her to where it can be done.
If it cannot be moved, place the leg on the bed and forcefully compress the thighs until there is strong convulsion, then administer the ligaments that you have previously recommended using pus (or liniments).
If childbirth has occurred, then apply that which soothes the cervix on it and study its reduction of pain; shape the fetus into its second natural figure and make the woman cough to encourage her entrance through the birth canal where she needs to come out.
Eye examination of the belly expanded its masses and facies, located on either side of one'dict mother. When the matron holds the hand of the pregnant woman and slowly turns it over little by little, this makes things easier.
When it is time for them to urinate, and they pause on the bladder we have prepared with oil and mucilage.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Exit from fetus prepared over the side (likely referring to a procedure where one prepares for childbirth by positioning themselves on the side)
When childbirth becomes painful according to this menstruation cycle, then you should insert your finger into the vaginal opening so that it can be expelled of moisture (likely referring to a traditional practice where one might use their fingers inserted in the birth canal during labor).
If the fetus is hanging on the face and chest of him/her (patient), then you should incise that part of embryonic material to prevent it from being retained or delayed in motion.
Here the treatment instructs to forcefully thrust the fetus into its parts within which pauses have been made, and commands the woman to take some measures on her own, as well as for those who are outside (likely midwives or attendants) assist with delivery if God will.
Exit from twins or fetuses of many. You know that twins are rubbed daily, and sometimes three or four times a day, it may be strange and bitter taste occurs inside; perhaps due to natural causes which cannot be cured by life itself.
Given the blend of linguistic elements from Latin and Romance languages such as Italian or French within this medieval medical text, here's an attempt to translate it into English:
If it is difficult for them to endure their childbearing and they come upon us with complaints about natural figures that are not of nature (referring possibly to excessive or painful labor), then attend to these pains as we have described.
If the midwife is subtle and softens liquids that make things easy and gentle, as well as delaying time, then her skill in all aspects aligns with what has been prepared for healing by this ingenious engineer.
Remembrance of what formed within the womb and was aborted.
Some are formed in the womb one to three or four times, and I must verify whether a woman has had five abortions, another ten formations, which causes pain due to the measurement of distinguished skilled ones.

When a woman is lying on the bed with her head inclined and legs raised up, it means that she has been positioned in this way for care or treatment purposes.
The minister takes hold of that limb or the one bound by rope, so that its body does not extend beyond and must be removed (presumably referring to a surgical procedure).
Return your own moisture (your saliva) into the mouth of the patient who is dry and lacking in mucus, using aloe vera juice, honey, and lentils to provide this moisture.
Here the midwife places her hand on these oils and mucilages, and positions herself with ease in the place where the cuts will remain fixed on the belly.

If it is about the feet of your patient, then either in their knees or between the ribs and backbone they feel pain.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: When the tongue is in the middle of its fourth place and bends at that spot where it lies between those on the right side of the body, insert the mouth easily into these places so that they can stay within them until healing occurs (the source).

So if the patient' extrusion has occurred from where it was placed (presumably an implant or some form of medical device inserted into the body), then tighten those sutures there, and thus ensure that the entire fractured part remains outside (or retained in place).
May it be an infection from the other side and not possible to reduce that by drawing the patient' extruded bowel inside; therefore place this cauterized matter within where all has come out, either at the site of protrusion or between the thighs.
When covering is done in both hips and feet.
If the head of the fetus is large, or if it's incontinent with water and urine flows between the hard spines and fissure at the top of its body, causing moisture to enter through there, which one uses an instrument called "alundat", whose form will come from those shapes of other instruments used here.
Here is the translation line by line for each source sentence:
If the head is seized and compressed by the shoulder blade (furcula), then it'supremess in moisture that which is within the breastbone shall be expelled/emanated.
If there is no complication and you do not vomit during the treatment, then cut through the head as far as your skill allows.
If there is a hole in the stomach or if it drops downwards (possibly referring to an intestinal issue), then you must pierce that which contains the moisture within it.
If your foot is on the ground (grounded), then this action of yours makes it easier for you to direct yourself towards the mouth of the woman, gently and smoothly.
If you have to squeeze the belly and chest, then take out that drape which covers your hand, so it can enter inside where the fluid flows in those places.
If other parts of the body are strained and turn backward, then when it comes to these matters, if the woman's mouth is open (possibly indicating a medical condition related to childbirth), insert her hand into the lower part of her abdomen; secure that area with this or those lancets/needles (two being mentioned here for clarity). Then thrust them through and back in until they are within the woman's mouth, at which point place a unction on it.
If the mother'thy mouth is constricted by scab that causes pain in it, then do not tighten further over it; before doing so, administer treatment for its moist fatty cause(s). And apply plasters; and follow the patient in waters that moisten and soften.
If it is on her chest, then if possible, make incisions with a sharp instrument: and apply the medicine that we have mentioned for her pregnant belly.
If it is not possible, then be cast into pills and extracted.
When no cause of secondary origin is found.
When you have completed all of your treatment, then administer what we discussed for the medication injections applied to joints that swell from the mother'thy condition.
If you have an outflow of bile that enters into sharp waters and administer another treatment.
And there was seen in the belly of which she had died, and on that point another wound grazed upon, and this is where the other child lay dead. Occurred an abscess on my limb for too long time; and there is swelling inside it that pushes out the joints.
And he has been called for treatment and cared for him long ago, but his child is not yet matured or fully formed.
And so you press upon it with some heavy compresses applied tightly for several days on and off the bone, applying ointment to one day, another to the next day; too much has astonished when there is not a trace of bone left inside.
And so you consider they are of bone from the dead fetus.
So then you clothe the patient with linen and extract their small bones located in the pelvic region, which have been jerking for a long time; this corrects them through such treatment.
And you do not force them to be strange, but when they come into water it is through knowledge and help that the doctor provides for their cure.
From the instruments necessary for extracting the fetus.
The form of movement by which it is lifted upward:
This is how they strain the free limbs into which two virtues are in their upper and lower extremities of both feet. Indeed this virtue may be subtle as chains or bands, and either fleshly (soft) or made of wood.
Here comes the source sentence to translate: "It is the length of each staff that ranges two digits and one digit wide at both ends, with a total span of three palms and nine finger-widths; in the place where these staves are already fixed firmly together, their combined lengths amount to three palms and nine fingers.

From the removal of the second one (assuming this refers to a previous reference or step in context). The translation for
When the second one is retained by you as an infant, then order the sick person who retains it to remove their saliva or phlegm, and apply that cathartic forcefully with your hand on its mouth and nose, and if so done effectively, they will recover.
If not, then take a fever and pierce through the cover with disruption (implying intervention for abdominal issues), pause in that burning herb which cools the mother's mouth, accompanied by calamint leaves, rue roots, cinnamon bark, and St. John’s Wort. This suggests a traditional remedy to alleviate symptoms when other methods fail (likely referring to soothing an upset stomach or fever). All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water within the wave, and pause it over the fire.
Return breath through the mouth of the woman using a catheter inserted into her mouth and insert that inside where there is congestion in the uterus (note: this sentence seems to mix some modern medical terminology with medieval practices). Here's an attempted translation line by line, taking into account possible language blending as well as historical context for translating such a text:
When that particular swelling is brought about as we have described before (and the second one appears suddenly), and its movement occurs quickly.
May if Roman approves of this treatment and there'thy is not recovery, then you command the maid to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or millet gruel; also have that immersed enter into his/her belly whereby she holds on it tight with one who was found as a second time. If joined together within the womb of mother (meaning, pregnant woman), then insert therein first wife's hand and hold firmly onto what is held; when that happens, extract said small object piece by piece until removal to prevent strong contractions which could cause labor or childbirth. Between the right and left sides of the body are made easy by this procedure.
If the mother'se mouth is constricted, we have already recommended cupping therapy and medicine derived from water, waves, plants.
If not all causes recommended have been addressed, be wary of acting on that in repetition and cycles, but if what is ingested from the mouth enters the hip joint of the woman, anoint it with ointment and take fourfold doses; this will purify those days when they are cleansed and dissipate away any remaining impurity.
May when the evil humors ascend to the head and stomach, they are led away by fumes under their influence; hence what is administered should be done through vaporous means that suit them.
May those of Antiques be brought under smoke treatment from nuts and dried fruits.
The shape of this tool by which a woman is retained from menstruation and the second childbirth, should be as follows:
Suffering is of bone or clay.
When subtlety is stopped below the chest and expansiveness above the focus (presumably referring to organs), and superficial congestion is halted in the abdomen' extraneous limbs, holding their hands tightly together.
And there enters that tongue inside which has been consumed by underground hummus and repeats itself again.
Of caring for an infant' extruded bowel not perforated (meaning that there is a non-ruptured, open section of int
Regarding the child's anus (bottom), it is not pierced or ruptured; there are subtle and diligent measures in place to care for this condition: Now cover the wound that she has made in his side with a linen dressing; and if not, pierce it with an iron pin (or splinter), ensuring that it does not touch her skin.
And place it over that wool and oil, and take care of what is inside so that nothing comes out.
If you fear that it is limp (possibly due to weakness or fatigue), then pause in the treatment room for a few days and observe when the child will want to move again.
And you have constricted the pupil of the patient'thy for suppuration or apendicitis; therefore when that constriction has been secured, and its cure is provided by what we said about healing and lead (a term used to refer to mercury in medieval medicine).
Of healing for those ulcers that come about occasionally.
When ulcers occur in the lower region of connectivity and larger muscles, which happen from behind or within one body division:
It is either an ulcer or discharges (perhaps referring to a draining sinus).
When that old clogging (possibly referring to the accumulated fluid or effusion) is connected and flowing from this inflammation-related fistula, some wounds are formed through these openings of the fistula.
Those penetrating objects are so feared because they cause exits and breathlessness; some even employ the diuretic for these matters, and others suffer from them.
From those fistulas occasionally wandering within the space and entering into the bladder, and from those that enter at the junction of the coccyx and the tailbone; these come from there:
And when the catheter you place in her rectum goes down into a penetrating and non-penetrating part of the fistula, it means that your finger is inside the rectum (and beneath) where not yet touched by either soft or hard instruments within the fistula.
If in that situation the humors enter under a subtle attempt of lead or horsehair within which you feel the attempted entrance or presence, it indicates an imbalance and potential invasion of these harmful substances into your body. In this context, "turtuositat" refers to some sort of blockage or impediment that is allowing for such a situation where humors can infiltrate more easily due to the lack of normal bodily function.
If you do not feel that thing in total nor proceed with any cause of indigestion or vermes (worms) and windiness, as we have said before, then know it is non-penetrating, and thus guide your treatment accordingly.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or the urethra, it signifies that its purpose is to extract and remove urine from there so as to ensure that this location becomes part of medicine'dictions.
If there is penetration into the joint space of the thigh or within the bone and causes pain in circulation, then his name here refers that he tries to enter further if not obstruction occurs inside the bone causing more pain; it should be quickly treated with hot poultices; such treatment has no value here, nor is this sealed by ointment.
In all those penetrating wounds there is not a cure at hand, and the work of these physicians on what has been tightened requires labor and fatigue.
May heal as hoped for according to your recommendation, and whatever has already been done will be furthered by iron (likely referring to the use of an iron-based treatment or procedure).

If that person feels heat entering through their colon, immediately insert your tongue into the colon for relief.
If you feel a thrust in the belly that has been discovered by self-examination, and if there is also sensation between the belly and either this bladder or flesh, then surely understand that it penetrates; therefore do not attempt to touch where she (the womb) resides.

If it enters internally and does not penetrate the area below where you are currently pressing (likely referring to a specific part of the body being examined or treated), between that point and what is hoped for flesh or sinew, there may be an ulcer on the skin surface above the cleft. Dry out the fistula within the region touched by your fingers, doing so at this location where it enters; as a result of drying out here, release through (or extricate from) that point which is trapped inside and heal therefrom fully.
When you purify those clogged veins which are assembled with the penis of an ass and do not break apart from any cause,
May it happen that the flow of phlegm comes between you and your body when those stones are inside; then with instruments for pus like cauterizing tools or acute medicine, they adjust good habits: thus congestion is relieved from those stones which have been tightened by excessive humidity.
Return the care for that which is wrapped in borders or has been divided within where it lies under the seat belt, and also take care of the young flesh encased with hardened meat born inside therein; securely fasten them all together again.
When treatments involving application and execution are applied, once restored, the patient is healed without fear of repetition.
If the fistula has entered into the belly and it is extended on the surface of the body, then bring its thread herein to investigate within there.
And if you have seen hundreds of attempts and between yourself and her it is impossible not to believe in the permeability, then there will be no operation here but rather a path through trust and hope.
The translated text is as follows: And in some cases the fistula is closed according to this method: when you insert the thread into the fistula, and it reaches the skin of the anus and at the perineum border, a needle-like suture (prepared by surgeons) is taken out following this form:
And insert into that faithful covering of fields or surroundings them, and attempt to insert the foot within the fistula wherein lies continuation;
May it penetrate the margin of the anus properly implanted therein; and extract the tip of that obstruction you've inserted into the rectum, remove its extremity, and adjust both ends to their respective examples, each first-time used for this purpose daily or over two days. Whenever possible, insert it back where those carnal parts between your anus extremities are located, ensuring they have descended as far inward after inserting the instrument therein today/tomorrow.
Return care for what is inside that has been made solidified and healed.
If the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, then you may attempt to make it so in any way that has been prepared for this purpose, but only if there are no abscesses present; and do so within which space will be healed.
The shape of the spine is what creates the fistula; its curve causes sharp pain and the other division does not cause it to be necessary, thus there may occasionally need to intervene.
From the seam of hemorrhoids in which blood flows therein.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Excretions from these two kinds are like bread dough and those seem similar as they come from grains; between the anus (or below it) appears something that seems like fat, which likely originates from carbohthypsum. From those small and large ones that come from these times of day and are one with them, their movements, and their exterior belly part, in the limbs of him/her.
Even if there is little moisture in the air, from which a yellowish or clear water flows constantly and according to its nature'dictate (color), at that moment of time:
When the treatment of that which was inserted into her colon is to command the humors in order for them to settle and appear within it, here we go: Now you crouch and hold your nails out to grasp that which will be dipped into your blood with the tool at hand, applying them onto those parts where their pulses are located.
May it not be so tight in those places due to their moisture and softness, then take a rough linen or wool cloth (or bandage), place them there for comfort, remove these clothes with tweezers from the areas of discomfort; dust some ash particles on top as directed during cauterization. Return that wound for healing with this other remedy while they are being cured.
If the belly does not refuse to pass through (i.dict "obey"), then crush it with pestles in which small portions have been taken, and wash these parts of water that is present in the colon where digestion occurs when the abdomen expels waste during a bowel movement.
If the hemorrhoids are empty in the buttocks, then their cause is humidity and they seek relief by pressing them with your finger or thumb; apply pressure to those areas where you have inserted these objects for healing purposes until they recover as intended.
And for one who avulses flesh according to this method: take firm covering and insert that into the needle's eye, then drive those swolthy parts up onto each of these divisions above it using said needle; wrap around with thread taken from the good material outside the place where the point is inserted in another division thereof. Afterwards tighten the stitch firstly, now fix and remove the needle, working longitudinally—and then perform a fresh suture on that broken flesh.
When it is necessary for all of them (the humors), and not that one among those, to flow away from the sick heart, thus preventing its excessive accumulation therein.
Return your hand over the belly, and place it there too, where covers are roasted or baked in oil or cereal; keep that same hand on his colon to command the humors inside not to rise again. When you place it inside that box; and when it is healed, take care of those inflamed areas within the container, which have also been treated therein with other remedies as well for their health restoration.
When such wounds are old and unhealthy in traditional medicine, you must address the points on the spine or within your tongue where they become moistened with outflowing pus from below; thus preventing further solidification of these areas. In English: This text discusses an approach to treating chronic wounds that have developed over time and are prone to infection (pus leaking downwards). The treatment involves addressing specific 'points' or lesions, possibly related to spinal issues suggested by the term "spumata" which may be referring metapthyically here. A wet cotton ball is placed within these wounds where pus has exuded ('moisten'), with the purpose of preventing further healing and consolidation (solidification) that could lead to more serious infection or chronic pain conditions, as per traditional medical beliefs outlined at this time. The treatment underscores an early intervention methodology within
You must take into account the vigorous outflow of pus from wounds, especially those that are newly formed and scabbed over ('excoriated'). In English: This instruction emphasizes taking immediate care for freshly infected areas where there is active drainage or oozing. The treatment should be applied as soon as possible to control the infection at its earliest stages before it worsens, likely referring back to a traditional healing practice which may involve applying specific medicinal agents directly onto these affected regions
Know that if you tighten (alamor), it is the key/cause, and not to be noticed by looking at the color of one' extrusion part on top of a nail; pain occurs throughout the body but mainly in the lower parts such as joints below knees and areas above them. Thus, for these pains you must use an amulet (anklet).
And when the fluid that is entrapped within the joint has entered its fissures or cavities and is extracted from it (presumably by some form of cautery), take care of it carefully.
If you wish, then burn (cauterize) the second that preceded in his chest.
May small ulcers are sharply pointed and round on the surface of the body, and they frequently come to the limbs of children.

May a small beetle or thickened and ulcerated surface appear on the body's skin here below, when it is crushed there in its appearance resembling the bite of an insect, causing pain all over the body.
Care for the patient involves using a catheter of penis or screw-shaped penis (presumably referring to an instrument used by medieval physicians), which is strong and rests on the inside where it contains within its circle, with your hand moving around the canula as inserted into their body parts; this also pauses there in the flesh layer of meat. And thus removes the humour from the patient'thy interior entirely.
If you wish, use a warm iron or steel rod according to this manner:

Of diseases or illnesses (The translation approximates the meaning based on a general understanding of medieval medical
In the division of diseases and their cures, so that it suited free will, you declare this remedy for those ailments and medical practices according to harmony (The translation approximates the meaning based on understanding medieval texts where Latin-influenced languages are used; "divisio" suggests an organized categorization or treatment of diseases ("plaguas"), with consideration given to individual choice, while discussing specific remedies for these ailments and corresponding medical practices.)
So you declare that diseases are varied according to the humors they stem from, and by which location within one's body we target them for treatment (The translation reflects a common medieval medical theory where imbalances of bodily fluids—humors—are thought to cause disease. The text indicates an understanding that different illnesses have their roots in varying types or locations associated with these humoral excesses, and therefore
And the causes for which diseases occur are due to leeches (medicinal or applied externally), pricking with thorns or splinters, blowing upon them, by sword or axe wielded in treatment actions—methods reminiscing those used against their sources. The passage indicates a range of external interventions believed necessary for addressing the root causes leading to diseases according to medieval medical practice; these methods include leech therapy (suckling at blood, which was thought to balance humors), using sharp objects like thorns or splinters directly on affected areas possibly as an attempt to draw out pus or other debris believed causing the illness. It's a reflection of how treatments were
And the diseases present in body cavities are addressed with maggots that reside on top of one's head (or skull), or neck, back, chest, belly, and limbs—corresponding to where these infectious entities inhabit. Herein lies a reference common during medieval times when leeches were often used internally for their perceived ability to draw out humoral imbalances believed responsible for diseases by suckling or draining the blood from affected areas, including cavities within various body parts mentioned in this context (head/skull, neck, back, chest,
And for some diseases, it is recommended a cure that rests and rules over the other illnesses.
When you consume foods that are simple in nature, the recall of complex diseases will come to the third part of the stomach for digestion.
Therefore say that when you experience a simple headache without fracture and there is considerable swelling along with pain on the affected side due to an abscess being drained, then: if it's for stone removal or mimicking disease symptoms, immediately press down upon the occiput as much as possible (and does not delay), extract from this portion according to its quantity only if there is no prohibiting cause of cauterization; most especially when such swelling indicates a simple abscess.
When there is a procedure involving the contrary of the affected partition, and you must protect the abdomen from overeating meat and drinks that are heavy in nature.
If from careful examination you find no cause at all, then reduce intake of food and avoid meat or drink entirely.
When pressure is applied over mud or in the water where it gets stuck, if you heat an abscess with caustic for treatment:
May it be certain that the poultice is effective if you place it on the ground recently applied (which means freshly moistened), and as long as neither soil nor air has dried out what was recommended for small treatment purposes.
If the air has changed and become cold, then rest with warm ointments inside until it is healed.
If the child is large or due to insufficient space and appearance, and their lips are not properly adjusted with puppets as recommended by them for surgery, then do so accordingly (adjust their lips like they suggest for surgery).
May it be discovered that the child already has bone and pen exposed, but not restrained by you with anything more than a small suspensor; hence insist on attending to this matter immediately so as to restore flesh in its proper place of thighs, commanding malady (body fluids) composed of pills/roots that swell or grow: acorn and beechnuts similar to them for their appearance.
If decay is present in the spine and does not adhere to the bone, then you cut off all this putrefied substance from it, and take care of that which has been removed with water (presumably for cleaning or flushing out).
If in these diseases an artery or vein from which blood may flow is not separated by medicine, then ask about the artery, and if you have cut that which has not been severed, cut it with a sponge or ligature; and if necessary to provoke what we have said does not cause discomfort, then perform cauterization where the blood vessel was cut.
If these plagues are simple and small, then their cause is humidity; so that you powder over them with this dust until the air dries those out.
The translation of the source sentence is as follows:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When any one performs alone cautioning without being in your presence and with sanction of dragon'se blood,

If the air is altered, and especially in summer, you do not understand where this powder should be placed, then take heed of what we have said before: rest thereon these more refined ointments that we mentioned, or let it dry on bread made from flour mixed with water and honey; and pay attention to those ingredients while they are being cured.
If you have a bone fracture in the body, then it is small and requires extraction through movement.
When directing the treatment for skull fractures in this fluid that is causing harm,
From the humors of the colon (referring to an imbalance or condition affecting one
When the feces are acidic in the colon, there is not much difference in treatment; and when it concerns the bowel of a child, things tend to be simpler (implying that treating constipation with an alkalinizing agent might differ for adults). This suggests medieval medical understanding acknowledged variations in conditions based on age but did not necessarily imply complex or distinct treatments beyond
If the colon's nerves or arteries are involved (indicating possible nervous system involvement), it is not merely about using water to produce strong constipation, but rather avoiding this remedy as if doing so could harm those same vessels; and use caution like handling glassware near eyes—avoid these substances completely from their nerves and take measures (likely precautions or protective actions) that they are not mercury-like in nature, which is often used medicinally but can be toxic. Here the text warns against certain remedies for constipation when there's a possibility of damage due to involvement with nerves and arteries (considering their delicate role). No causes any external source of madness for none reason; the substance within nerves is itself feverish and continuous flow therein reaches the brain, which then applies to all body parts.
If water is needed for the treatment of simple medicines, take some warm or cold water and apply it to the skin along with poultices made from herbs (or without them), while heat when washed in hot water together with other stones rubbed according to this methodology, and ointment moistened.
If the child is large, then apply stitching or press their lips together, and take care that it be healed within therein (inside).
If there is depth or softening in the lower parts of the body mass removed by scraping (which could indicate an abscess), then through that location pierce it with a needle for drainage.
If in the soil there is an inserted artery and a flow of blood has been obtained from it, then separate or dry out that one if necessary; otherwise, perform cautery on it to induce diuresis (fluid expulsion).
If you have already immobilized the vertebrae of the collarbone or all, and thus saved the veins in the neck, then adjust your lips on the spinal column's bone with sutures without touching it; afterwards return that area to its natural shape, tighten that part for proper alignment according to bodily structure, leave them like this for a few days until healing. Moreover take care of him so swelling and excitement do not enter where the immobilization is placed.
If the child also experiences pain in their bones, then I will strike that area; and if there are pieces of bone fragments present, remove all those you can from them; but if it is not possible for me to enter inside, let the piece lodged within allow its escape, so that removal (of the foreign body) may occur.
If the child is freshly born then grind over that dust which has been recommended for you. May it be that if there is an opening or fistula in the patient'dict (implied by "plagna"), then treat it with water from which memory will recall, at their head (the implication being towards where they sit).
If it is a lance or couchstitch (indicating some form of physical intervention), and at times you assess the depth, consider perhaps that the flatulence from within increases when the belly swells; know then that intestinal gas can be life-thseeking.
If there is not depth and the putrefied matter has recently come to his sanctum (body), then you pause in that first hour of morning oil anointing, without stretching so as not for him to retain anything deep within his body cavity and return it to his heart, perhaps pausing with oiled liniment on limbs where stagnant matter has gathered over the day.
If the ointment is not at your disposal, then rest in the water puddle where you may drink what comes from the humidities; and make sure that gout sleeps on top of the mud so that flows into it which already exists within him/her.
May it be that if from the patient three days or more have passed without aggrafalteness of the malady, nor spasm in the spleen nor trembling of the heart and constriction of breathing passages; then use the other beneficial means available to you. Then take care for this person's cure (and) as soon as they are healed from whatever ailment it is that has been provided treatment for, attend also to their recovery process with these remedies and actions so ensured.
If the healing of him/her is delayed and there has been an opening for a while now, then you should know that already it'thy become abscessed—take care of this by your own means (or with medication prescribed).
If the pain is caused by a fissure in space or wound and it'supersimplon on the surface of the skin or back, treat that with water which has preceded stitching (if large), or powder if small:
If there is pain before the bone and your stones are already opened (i.thyroid or kidney stones), then use forceps to extract those stones if they have been separated. May it not be separated; hence let them enter that the swarm may be extracted from there with ease allowed by their removal.
From other accidents in other body parts, health recovery is achieved through what we have mentioned earlier regarding the fluid (aqua).
From stomach diseases or disturbanse of the belly's passages/pauses
The condition that causes discomfort in the stomach can be either great or little (numerous), or wandering/moving around. Here "gran" and “pau” refer to large quantity while 'migera' suggests a movement of some sort, possibly
A slight disruption is caused by other's misconduct (referring to poor dietary or health habits), and it becomes difficult for others if not the intestinal contents that have been disturbed enter their place again; consequently, they become overwhelmed ("ure" suggesting excess) with difficulty in removing these elements – likely referring to bloating due to reintroduction of waste which makes its removal challenging. Here "seco es reducio de lor," indicates the struggle or effort required for reduction (removal), and "quar se ubre engrossat per que le intrament" implies a heavy burden caused by internal disorder, potentially referring to bloating as mentioned before in this context of medieval medical understanding. The use of terms like 'mismanagement' ('autra manieyra') combined
Therefore, the worst disturbance is wandering (continuous movement or lack of rest), which becomes particularly difficult to address in that case; similarly challenging as it often is within these specific organs mentioned ('les doas spescial'). Here 'migera' and ‘dificil’ reinforce the idea from earlier translations about ongoing issues with waste management affecting both mobility (wanderings) of elements inside, indicating a condition potentially linked to chronic
Be aware that the belly'mends are divided into four kinds of linings and may need stitches which correspond to those used for other diseases on the body.
When two other stitches communicate with each other or possibly even among themselves in the abdominal stitch, it may be either mutually between them or within their own seam itself.
When you recommend that each one of us expose ourselves and declare our conditions.
So when the child is small and has some cause for the hernia (the protrusion of internal organs through an opening in the abdominal wall), it's difficult to reduce that, either because of its diminutive size or due to inflation caused by cold air.
And when water is drunk alone or sipping it with a wet cloth soaked in warmwater, and coriander, fennel seeds, and liniments applied to the area within which inflammation occurs, then that swelling should be resolved.
And when some measures are taken here where it has been tightened, and water alone is better for the resolution of inflammation.
When the inflammation is resolved, then you wet the intestine in the cavity where it has been elevated and surrounded by vinegar and herbs; thus, watering with a little cause helps to alleviate its condition within the body.
If it is possible to release the interior from this treatment, then divide the rupture into small parts using an instrument that has been inserted in her groin (emphasis on precise translation).
The primary treatment is better when it does not involve cutting and there'thy no need for further drying or removal of excess moisture.
Of that tool, its shape is as follows:
One sharp blow and the other not acute, and the subtlety that is neither in the slightness of bone, nor curved by this cause narrows a little bit.
And when the vermin is increased and comes out of the hernia, it is best to reduce its size according to its natural form in its proper place if possible over there, as much better that way.
When the disruption is wide and it's in the lower abdomen area where you press on their thigh (their groin), hold their cushion under them, place supports below their head so that they sit up; if it's above the stomach region, then support their neck with pillows placed around their back.
Here comes the first source sentence for translation:
And when you administer fluid in large pus and purulent (or infectious) sores,
In the small pains you have prepared (prepared some remedy or treatment for), place it where your servant is between your most painful parts, holding their hand which encompassees total disruption at its middle and adjusts the lips of him/her accordingly to this suture cause.
Here is the translation of each line:
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English:
Here come the agues to travel between swelling and subtlety, where small needles move within the flesh; large ones are difficult in the spinal canal, hence why they might migrate into both fineness and coarseness.
And where the needle is inserted into any of the patient'sin body extremities provided for, to ensure that flesh does not separate and dirt doesn't accumulate before its healing process.
And that they are not extended for stitching so that the patient is not prevented from healing.
Here comes the first source sentence: Place your fingers on the ends of the needles so that you do not allow the malignancy to enter while they sleep, and pause over the widened stitches spread throughout the entire operation site where these finger tips are located; then place them inside once you know that the pus has been consolidated.
Here these surgical needles are inserted into the small wounds in a careful manner, it is sufficient for their stitching either one of those or an additional thread provided around them.
May the second stitch be common: and it is that you gently insert a needle into which has an inlaid silver wire within its shaft, on both of the four limbs' extremities from the coccyx to the upper ends of the legs, using finesse with precision.
When the needle has penetrated these four extremities, reduce the sharpness of that portion from which you are extracting it, to ensure that the wound is sewn up with strong cloth as usual suture material for proper healing and closure.
And there is a pause between each stitch of the thick part of this bandage/bouquet.
This stitching knows how men should be treated.
Here comes the source sentence to translate: And he has sutured the child who was ill in his belly, which had a large worm inside of one palm and extrusion by two thumbs' distance from the distended bowel; consequently, he reduced that which protruded because it had been stuck out for 24 hours.
And after fourteen days or so have passed, and the treatment has been applied thereafter, care is provided for it, with attention given to motion according to its disposition over time as heals progress.
Even though these doctors had not been healed themselves; but by miracle of the focus, they did not cure that wax which was in a place where it wasn'thy being touched nor with any medicine at all—perhaps some relief occurred after two days bathing daily in honey water within the focal area.
May you present two types of stitches according to what is described in Paragraph.
When you begin with needlework on the throat and insert the spit-wiped needle from the forked end into the divided tongue area, it is implied that they are about to perform some sort of medical treatment or procedure using their own saliva as a disinfectant. The sentence suggests an old practice where bodily fluids like saliva
So when the needle enters into the throat and down those divided parts of it, as far along both lengths without end, stopping at where you had previously inserted the needle; then make the other tip penetrate from the fissured part to its corresponding extremity on your body. This translation describes a medical practice that involves threading or inserting a sharp object (like a sewing needle) into specific divided sections of one's throat and subsequently proceeding with an analogous process in another area, likely for therapethy purposes related to the areas mentioned. It suggests some form of treatment where bodily fluids such as saliva are used possibly on or near these body parts—potentially reflective of ancient medical techniques that might have included self-treatment methods and use of available resources like spit (as a disinfectant) for cleaning instruments before inserting them into the skin. The language indicates detailed knowledge about human anatomy, as well as proced
So once you have performed the insertion of the needle as described previously in this context, then proceed to make another puncture on that limb's fissured area (perhaps referring back now specifically mentioned earlier) with your own tool or instrument; and allow for whatever is outside these divisions—likely a reference once more to parts inside one’s body affected by the condition being treated. The mention of "la extramitat del ciphac" implies an external focus on certain internal areas, while maintaining continuity in treatment methods through repetitive insertions or manipulations as part of this therapeutic practice—possibly aimed at balancing humors within the body according to medieval medical theory. This line further emphasizes a ritualistic and cyclic nature inherent to these ancient remedies, where repeated actions are believed to restore health by addressing imbalances caused by external elements such as "cold" or “humoral” excesses that might be contributing factors in the patient’s symptoms. The translation
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
E begins at this side of the patient's chest and from that, takes hold of the extremity end in the other place (other limb), and thrusts it into that same joint where there is an opening created here on this flank; then removes the needle already inserted in that joint.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
The sum of this suture work is that you sew the skin with which hairs grow, ensuring stitching along the part of the extremity of the coda (tailbone), and let it rest until completed.
Might the second specific type of suture that Gualia speaks and recommends for you to use is what your local medicates as well; applying it ensures all parts are mended properly according to nature, placing another part from yourself on top, followed by its mirror image below. And when needed:
When you keep the needle at your chosen part of departure, and make that go into the divided parts herein described, turn over the needle so it enters from two points on each side of this division; thus ensuring penetration back to the departed portion through these same twin extremities.
And turn those bones over, and let the cold humors from within flow back into their respective cavities through either of the limbs' ends that are in opposition to each other on this side (the outside).
This stitching is better than ordinary sewing and it's the one from which memory returns.
This is called "Guaian discourse.
Even if the patient'thy bowel has been sewn with two needles on their stomach, so that you can insert these into eight places around them where they were previously sewn (within whose bodies), begin to introduce this other thread of yours as quickly as possible.
When there is a disturbance in the intestinal location of the belly, then putting together this part becomes difficult compared to other parts within the abdomen.
May the remedy of medicine for sickness be judgment regarding other illnesses.
When this cause occurs as soon as you complete the recent flesh before God'dict daily provision is altered and return the intestine (budel) and hernia to their cavity, placing your hand on that skin surface therein; thus preventing it from becoming infected.
If the air has altered the humors within you and causes them to accumulate in that part, whereupon they form hard pus and coat the fields (of blood), becoming consolidated into abscesses; take care of this malaise as with other illnesses until it is healed.
If you do not have the medicines at hand, then rest upon that most urgently needed one for now; as it begins to take effect within a day or two with your aid and teaching, by which time healing will occur—you need not seek other medical interventions when afflictions are simple.
If you fear that the vermin may communicate in injury to the main members of the body, then submerge wool in warm or scalding oil quality, and pause it where between joint angles and limb supports are located; place your hands there as well for additional support.
If there is pain or putrefaction in your intestines, it will come and go periodically; if the inflammation reaches its cavity, that black ichor flows out of you quickly, mostly when the inflammation has entered into the cavity itself.
Be aware that what is large from within (the intestine) heals more readily than what lies beneath the small ones (small hernias).
It is difficult for the intestine being called "gout" to receive healing provided by birds in this body; and it is due to the great number of veins present here, as well as their large size within these vessels, and also because of the delicacy of that part' extrinsic to him/her (the patient), along with its proximity to nerve structures.
If what you are processing from the dirt is fabric (soil), then acquire that fresh and proceed with your action on it as quickly as possible in order to reduce swellings down there manually.
If space has been created and black or dark substance (pus) is already present therein, then you press that faithful part over the area where it is discolored, in order for blood to flow out from those veins and arteries.

Remembrance of the pains when inflamed in the hernia.
When you have disruption in the intestine and it is requested to be restored at home, then this may happen because that which was causing pain in your abdomen due to percussion of a lance and therein resided vermin from the seventh part of the stomach (which are old, infected with worms/fistula), accompanied by agitation and breathing.
And now you administer the treatment for him and it may cease to subtly enter where healing occurs and stability is established in the location.

Return the intestine inside its cavity, and rub it there until the wound within the belly is healed, without causing harm to anyone in that area of illness (the humoral imbalance).
And it is possible that the intestine has been pierced by something delicate from within the patient's body, placed with a needle; and you grasp its extremity here in your hand, encapsulating it there, covering said point of the intestine with this thread/wool, then insert such into holes made for that purpose on or around this organ (the intestines), thereby reducing disruption.
This cutting method is only a second means of trust and hope.
If the patient is large and wide, especially if it's in one of the small intestines, then it cannot be handled directly but requires delicate treatment, and not a complete recovery for all.
Of care for hernias and fistulas.
You understand that when a child and lameness occur together as they age, resulting in ulcers which do not heal over time nor detach themselves from the entire armor (the skin), universally there emerges an abscess called pus everywhere, to which we refer.
E fistula according to truth is a tightly woven, hard, white fabric of which there is no pain, and where it constricts as does the pinch of grief; therefore they call that soft rage (gout), namely, this suffering.
In moistened houses where it gets wet and the dampness dissipates within a few hours. Some moisture is moved here, and it is scanty, thick, and subtle.
And have shown all those causes, and their signs are known by these remedies in the division of medicine.
And when you wish to learn about the treatment of an opening (fistula) caused by surgery, here it is:
E understand that fistulas occur in all the members of the body, some of which reach to great veins and arteries, or nerves, spine, bladder, any part on backs, thoracic vertebrae'sfellowbones, or at joint junctions formed by articulation of head and limbs; these fistulas that bring proximity to the main body parts and similar ones.
So that these kinds of ulcers from this illness are diseases difficult to cure and do not receive care; they require labor and lack of knowledge about them.
If there is any depth in the ulcer that does not reach these locations mentioned herein and you expect healing from it, and wish to gain knowledge of it, then take iron or barber's tools; if the fistula after correction continues straight, seek her among them.
May it be that if the fistula is twisted, seek out a subtle lead to which this metal underlies its own body' extrication and curvature of distortion shall occur.
If there is an abscess with horror-inducing pus present, it's not within your power to attempt on top of it.
Now wash the wound with their ointments; for the moisture used to cleanse that area will also be absorbed by those other medicaments and come from them as well.
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
When you have stood over all these causes and see them clearly fixed in their place, then go to the treatment according to your confidence: for it is that which you consider as fistula close or within joint space, near ligaments, nerves, arteries, veins, or any of those places where they are lodged.
When it dries out as directed by your physician'thy methodology, and you remove what is present in that filtration which comes from decayed flesh or meat products such as those found within the body itself, its tissue (the abscess), where these fluids accumulate, will heal.
May if the fistula is of deep length and secondarily healed, then cover it with what you can within your reach as much as possible; clean that part thoroughly from all its corrupt flesh, and apply dressed poultices wrapped in sharp medicines inside this cavity, which you have understood well.
When some of that which is ruptured enters the cavity of the fistula through decay, at certain intervals while medical treatment persists, then it will be expelled from therein by medicine applied sharply and directly.
And restore that which is within in wax that produces healthy flesh inside while it heals.
If it is not healed by this remedy, then apply a second round of caustic treatment as recommended.
May if the cause of fistula is blood or requires your confirmation, then inquire about that same and dry it as recommended, provided you do not prevent any possible causes related to veins or nerves or main limbs according to what we have said.
If you discover your bones and there is any decay or blackness within, then extract that which contains the rot completely; take care of it with whatever liquid inside the body that can restore its health.
If you are not healthy and heavy sweat occurs as usual, then know that you have not reached the cure for all corruption; hence immediately examine further on yourself with great care to restore balance in body and mind at once, leaving nothing undone afterwards.
And if it is healed (the patient), eat; but if not, then you should know that this corruption lies deep within the body' extrinsics, and hence take measures to address it therein.
If the bones are decayed or damaged (les os corromput), it is within your power to extract them; then use small forceps which I have agreed upon for this purpose (ad aquo).
If you have an obstruction in the bones, then extract all of them entirely without leaving any cause for your strength'dictorship (doctor).
If there is any contrary cause of moisture in them, and they have not fear nor mistake within their insight, then you should inspect those ligaments or bones here present, and release the bones.
If you are not prepared to set the bones of your hour (hips), then place a cushion under them so that it moistens and softens what is below, ensuring that this keeps its wet state without solidifying into construction material for the body part that has been worked on in your operation.
Having feared (if afraid), pause over the potion submerged above for three days or in a jar of Egyptian oil, or among other oils they have obtained, when those same ligaments are taken out and their bones become separated from them, at which point these things should be removed.
If there is a great bone with the knee or thighbone (os coyssa o camba) of these individuals, and what has been ruined from them it appears on their face so much, then for how long that damage remains visible only as time passes by; after such duration, take care to restore health.
If the part of it from which you have been contaminated is great, and decay has already reached the bone marrow, then it becomes necessary to close that area wherein the deterioration has arrived, so as for healing within there may be consolidated.
And you are recommended that the water should be brought to one'se house, so as to ease and assist with your operation.
Once upon a time there was a young man whose state is xxx years old; to him pain occurs in the groin area, and from disintegrated matter that enters into the body through which it has entered, made of dense material itself (a great abscess), not caused externally by external factors.
And now the fever spreads in her because of the errors made by doctors within which pus has accumulated, and its healing focus advances while a fistula (open wound) develops inside it; there are fire-induced objects used by all to drain moisture and heat from her.
And after two years of treatment by many doctors and not in the body' extrinsic fluids but within the arts, he was called back.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And here is the cushion of that person and all materials running through it, and already their body was completely swolthy and its hue was lemon-colored.
And then insert the thread into one of those orificeal openings and reach through with it until reaching within, wherein to introduce (the thread).
Return them quickly and examine urgently these instruments for all parts of the change (surgical tool), as they are needed by each section.
And now you have cut and dissected within those places where I exposed one of the bones, having rotten it out and ruined it completely; also corrupted a portion inside which had already entered into the cavity.
Whenever you find water that I have discovered and prepared for bone treatment,
When you have ensured that it was not in the bone but rather that decayed condition which had been excised and sealed up, there already has been a reduction of separation (implying healing or recovery).
When proper time for restoration of health by conservative medical means has passed and it is not restored (i.dict), the implication suggests that without intervention or a change in treatment strategy, there will be further deterioration of one's condition despite previous efforts to heal using traditional methods over long
And then investigate further upon the secondary layers of the skin after discovering it initially (indicating a deeper examination), and there continues to be deterioration or damage to the bones beneath these outer surfaces over time, suggesting chronicity in their condition that requires additional attention beyond initial assessment.
Inquire into how the bones have been affected by this deterioration (seeking insight into skeletal involvement), and apply fair healing methods for restoring you to health that are currently being used or proposed; however, these efforts will not restore your condition. This line indicates a need for alternative therapeutic approaches when standard ones fail in treating the underlying issue with bones affected by chronic joint pain caused by conditions like
And so you discover further details of it within your body incrementally and apply restoration efforts piece by piece (indicating meticulous attention to the repair process), aiming for complete recovery before completing a full rotation around yourself, outside these interventions removing what is believed inside them—the bone marrow. Once extracted as needed, this material finds its way back into medical treatment; it helps consolidate and heal (referring potentially to therapies involving the patient's own materials or biological components). This line suggests a holistic approach where even small restorative actions are taken with precision until full recovery is achieved within one turn around oneself. The phrase may indicate that this careful, iterated process could lead not only to physical healing but also contribute toward spiritual purification (consolidate the leugierament and sanat), which in medieval contexts often intertwined bodily health with moral or ethereal well
It is not necessary repetition in the operation of Lu and Lui unless for the disposition of Lu'se humors and their low tolerance to suffering, as Lu will act throughout all hours due to excessive bowel movements caused by malady.
And so heals the entire body, and nothing is within hardened flesh; good fortune lies in his disposition on his own limbs, returns the vitality of himself back to them; converses harmoniously with their dispositions without causing disruption during walking or any damage from causes.
If your arm protrudes and you are twisting it according to this method: then take the bandage (ligament) around that limb, tighten it at its extremity on that outstretched arm, command an assistant to extend it further; pull apart a thicker part of the first bandage from the other, place that here over the flesh you want in those parts now detached for cutting.
When a cuddy or table is placed over the body when you make an incision, it's permissible if the saw does not cut into the corrupted flesh.
When the screw is worn down little by little at this location and does not appear in its entirety upon feeling it, then another burr has been used on it previously.
If the bones are decayed and not prominent, they form one division or another in it; therein is rupture occurs within that which has been divided into parts—and when this happens at once, pause briefly with a sword blade from where first occurred destruction (i.dictio), and cut away all of the remaining flesh throughout these divisions entirely; afterwards, wait some moments before proceeding further, cutting anew what was broken in the initial division while continuously maintaining that which has been repaired so far intact.
And if it is necessary for the cautery (point) to be placed according to the location of the decay, as we have mentioned.
If decay is present at the joint, cut away that decayed joint itself, and saw off where it connects to the other parts.
If decay is in the continuous flow of joints, it is not for lack but due to a deficiency.
If the corruption is in the mouth or chest, it'se difficult; however, if you seek out wherein this decay appears to thee and remove that part which thou canst manage according to any manner at thy disposal, thereupon do so for correction until no contradiction from within (the heart or nerves) occurs.
E understand which instruments are appropriate for each bone situation according to the state of these things – their size, texture, delicateness and grandeur; fragility and rarity – so that you can prepare suitable tools for this entire operation.
When you understand that this operation concerns the specificity of the instrument from which it is performed; when you are great in knowledge and long experience with these instruments, as well as witnesses of their use for illnesses, then you have already mastered what has been necessary to treat them according to the needs of each patient.
And when you are forming in the day of this chapter, prepare with ease those tools which will be used for your treatment process that you will undergo on others. Form of saw (This line is likely referring to an instrument used in medieval medical

This line describes how specific shapes were relevant for different medical tools, implying their purpose was tailored according to function.
Instead of conventional methods, they are meant for grinding or scraping the heads off joints when corrupted (this could refer to removing diseased parts during surgery), and it may also be a broad mouth tool ('mors grande' suggests an instrument with significant opening capacity). This line further elaborates on how medieval practitioners might have utilized tools differently for specific medical tasks.

The alternate saw's shape is that of a sharp bone held in place by iron (likely referring to an instrument where the cutting edge was made from sharpened animal teeth or naturally occurring materials, and bound with metal for durability). Additionally, its member/hand pieces are fashioned like punches ('membra punxament' could be a specialized tool used alongside such saws), possibly indicating that these were multifunctional tools in medieval surgical practice.

From joints and bone fractures.
The extremities are weakened or due to internal/external causes, or when you treat that corruption with these remedies and the cure does not comfort them, then sometimes the corruption moves from a limb without being touched by any cause; thus enter this body part into water (likely meant as immersion in water for therapedictinal purposes) to make sure the humors escape their natural course of flow outward/toward death or malignity, which is considered worse damage than not having a touching external factor.
And the name of that person to whom you have inflicted pain, is because their limb has been deeply cut where the flame consumed it completely or if they are pale due to blood loss within that body part which affects the whole body; therefore, this torments you intimately.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the decay or rupture is in the said limb'dictum', then you shall incise it and not leave spaces for the decay to enter into its cavity.
If you reach the point (likely referring to treating or examining an area), then cut that piece of flesh near the fire source'dictor ('focal'), and do not leave space for decay within the flame-heated arm part.
If that one enters (enters), then you will insert your arm into the cleft at the joint.
If another flaw passes and I send the thighs downwards, then in that case it is the death of humors (indicating a severe condition), and administering further treatment according to necessity becomes an act of virtue/care.
When a portion of the foot appears sickly and decays within it itself, then insert that part into one of its bones.
If you ascend on the foot, then cut it entirely through the foot. May your pus enter into the cavity within the abdomen; then you shall make an incision in the cushion within that junction of the abdomen.
If rot (corruption) has already reached the diaphragm, it is not engagement but expulsion of the humors from life, and thus remove melancholy to death.
E the act of inserting or sawing the limb is that you tighten the bandage on the part where you intend to insert/saw, and stretch another bandage over the location; extend the minister's bandages to the parts at once, extending another servant'thy bands in their places; separate the meat between two lath splints within which it will be entirely exposed. And tighten or saw inserted/cut herein.
When cloth is wrapped around the entire body in such a way that it does not touch the affected area and allows for proper drainage of the adjusted injury or abscess wound, then:

Return its injured limb to what is natural and take care that it heals within there.
And recommend to you that which comes into the home on your foot, this accident for which I advise you herein; it is darkness coming upon your foot due to cold gathered around there by fire (possibly indicating chill or frostbite).
When that decay occurs for the first time within your body, take care of the entirety of the limb where it is located.
And then that home prepares for the patients to go towards their limbs where they feel pain and hardness in them, inserting the finger into the joint, which heals.
Once there occurred that same doctor's misconduct in this matter of importance.
And now I am affected by this excess water that has been retained upon the surface of my body, and I cleanse its humoral composition; there is no further overflow or coming to another part within it.
Here comes the sentence to translate: And now you are asked to insert my hand into it (the cavity), and do not wish to perform any action on its repercussion, for the humoral imbalance was about suppuration or pus formation.
When he is dismounted from me, returns to his land and comes back to me that this man has prepared himself completely in every way, and becomes healthy again.
This sentence can be translated as: "It has not been healed in this accounting only for the purpose of aid concerning what comes from this illness and to serve as a symbol by which it is understood and its treatment carried out.
Of treatment of the belly and quality of enema administration with medicine.
When an abscess is formed within the flesh of the limbs and its space extends until it collects disease, then it is broken through and perforated; thus, we treat the illness herein contained, applying poultices as needed (as dressing), placing a cloth undernethy for absorption purposes. It has not progressed to any further corruption nor penetrated into bones or nerves/tendons—it is addressed with gentle pressure and named without becoming fistula;
Indeed if spaces are extended within which the decay affects any part of the body, it is then called a fistula and cannot heal on its own.
The cure for him/her is that when you immerse the entire thigh completely while turning it over and mainly when it becomes like a drape so that it does not stick to its place due to decay.

Here are the translations line by line:
If the malady cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, then administer that same mixture of water and honey three times, mixing in vinegar each time; this allows for cleansing and washing (because of the properties of honey), making it adhere to dryness, primarily when excessive secretion and dryness are present.
When you have taken some waters and find that the belch has come upwards, then perform an enema on what causes discomfort in him/her now.

When the suppository is large, then you must insert it into the rectum and leave a quantity in which part of the cleansing material can be added within.
If the warmth applied to his body causes his limbs (the braces) to rise above their place in him so that he runs quickly, when his arms are constricted by the curve of the flesh where the meat is generated within him;
If it is not possible to incise the sinus within the osseous cavity as you wish, then pierce what prepares your limb for the braces of the skeleton so that there is no obstruction in its pathway according to how you dress and ensure nothing prevents this.
When someone is above the channel of flow (possibly referring to blood), they are warmed up instantly in such a way that any accumulation present in their chest vessel becomes evaporated or dissipated quickly. For that you know if what flows from the bowels is good or little and digests well, or not at all digested.
And so you should carefully observe where that sensation occurs in him/her, and if it is an ulcer there, then proceed accordingly:
When your medical care is prolonged in this manner, and the material that adheres to the entrance of the wound sticks on there (adhesion), then you should apply it or cleanse for three days, and when dressing changes are made, change the cloth and renew lubrication.
If from the sinus you extend spaces for subtle viruses to enter (meaning if there is an infection or illness entering through body cavities), do not despair of him, as healing takes place within those very places where decay generates flesh during feverish times and on which his current affliction lies.
If from the belly it is secreted bile indigested for days, you will know that the belly does not adhere; and if delayed adherence of the belly occurs as its cause (likely due to excessive greasy food), then apply decoctions made with medicinal herbs internally or externally from their substance and humidity.

Panarici is an abscess wherein the pus of this foot or leg has now also occurred in other places, and as it prolongs its treatment becomes highly valued; if it's a simple purulent inflammation (abscess), then apply cautery for suppuration, but if corrupt (spreading disease) occurs at that spot where the pus flows out under pressure of odor into bedsores and turns blackness to extremity. The color also becomes dark brown here.
And when you have applied that amount of fluid which we mentioned in the division and do not interfasse with your treatment, then apply iron to remove all excess fat from the skin, for this will invigorate healing swiftly.
May the bone be and the ulcer is healed, and its accessories are removed from the parts divided by it, whereupon you begin to lance and drain that part which has been paused under subtle blows of the scalpel on the site of the wound. You then lift this up and inspect it while applying pressure with a salve until all corrosive medicines within have burnt out; afterward paying special care for where the ointment is applied, to ensure its complete healing.
May the corruption be already in the bone beforehand; therefore you must insert it into that place and extract it out because there is never a time when the bone becomes rotten within its location.
If the liver and gallbladder are moving within it (the body), then you should incise that part according to what is prescribed for its healing, ensuring that such thing enters into recovery.
May you use percussion or incision on the spleen where there is intense pain as if preparing for bloodletting, and dry out the wound with salt applied to the spine across (or under) the transverse abdominal muscle; thus causing significant discomfort in the organ enlarged by excessive congestion above its natural place within the body.

Here they are in the flesh of our bodies at joints, or perhaps their natural state is within the bones of these very limbs (or "fingers"). In this line, it can be understood that certain body parts like fingers might have a specific location wherein they naturally reside – possibly indicating anatomical positions significant to medical understanding in medieval Those which naturally reside within the bones of our fingers do not fall ill here (referring to joint pain), and those that are found at joinings must necessarily suffer from ailment or inflammation ("must undoubtedly experience discomfort"). This line suggests an observation where certain conditions affecting parts like finger bones might cause symptoms, while
And of those that are muscular in nature; the section is light and it requires you to take one into consideration for a central nerve or sciatic (the term here may refer loosely to what we now understand as 'sciatica', involving inflammation along the pathway where spinal cord meets with leg).

And of those dwelling at the joint's core, care or treatment is difficult (implying that conditions involving inflammation in this area may not be easily managed); therefore keep a watchful eye on it as well. This final line emphasizes vigilance and possibly suggests routine observation to monitor such challenging areas where injuries might occur due to their delicate nature, aligning with the medieval

From ignorance of deficiense (deficiency or lack), they become swollen.
Variations in the veins are present, and these swolthy yellow humors flow within them of each part of the body; they primarily occur in the cushions (bolsters), especially among travelers and workers, and merchants who carry loads.
Now when you administer the purge of cholera black several times for strong evacuation, and bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
Medicine may have two courses of action for this issue: one is that it should be made clear and drawn out the black bile within them; the other course involves raising the vein and extracting it entirely.
Here's the line-by-line translation of this medieval medical treatise:
Return it here (referring presumably to some substance or treatment), and commands that he refrain from black humors which bring forth illnesses.
Iterate the cauterization for varicose veins when they are swolthy and come upward in the malady.
May their elevation be according to this method: if you lift the cushion of the thighs and immerse it in water so that they become pinkish and the veins are swolthy; or if it is exercised with vigorous activity, as long as there's no bath present, until the limb becomes injured.

The sign of the patient's susceptibility to this event (possibly referring to labor or illness) is in that vein which you heat up violently at its joint with the leg; and here, it gets inflamed ('es vesicat'); then begins the flow from that same swollen vessel as if driven by a plant's thirst for water. Here 'senhal de la suscepcio' indicates symptoms or signs showing vulnerability to an oncoming condition (possibly labor in pregnancy), with inflammation ('es vesicat') at the junction between leg and body, suggesting that there might be a significant change occurring – potentially childbirth. The 'vesicación', referring
And when the extremity appears, I wrap that around it – encase of lead where there is weight like that of a dragon (symbolically suggesting using heavy or dense material for bandaging). Inside this enclosure ('ii drac'), you introduce more; and then perchance scent that same slab suspended at the joint. Here, 'adonc cum appar' means "then when it appears," which in context refers to a situation where an armor-like covering is applied for protection (possibly referring to treating or handling labor). The metaphor of introducing and possibly scenting lead within represents perhaps some form of intervention—
When so many times there are causes of disease beyond these parts, wrap them up in lead and this will prevent the issue from worsening further. If it is prolonged, then you cut a part and wrap the wound; do not insert that which comes out into it while cutting it, otherwise if inserted, contracts inside the flesh causing suppuration (infection) and boil formation in the place affected by decaying matter.
For that it may be treated gently and removed gradually from the patient'se body without causing discomfort or pain in their limbs:
From this vein in men, who are at its full length of the arm and fingers, it has already reached me by which I have touched one out of twenty finger lengths.
If it is inserted into the hour of his medical care, then insert the sponge into the wound and penetrate that long ulcer on the body part until all fluid present in the matter has been drained out, and administer putrefaction from this place for several days as medicine; and take appropriate care for abscess treatment.
This vein occasionally has blocked passages, and mainly when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself, bringing forth pus from various abscesses; these are its blockages.
Therefore take care of that ache as we have discussed in division and water which has been mentioned.
From the worms generated under the skin it is called bovine disease.

So when it appears, you should apply pressure to that area every time and along the way, best of all – either by incising or sectioning that part accordingly (either cutting deeply into it with a cutter/incision tool or dividing it using forceps), this ensures its location.
She is in great pain and if you worsen that condition, she will feel a limb of her body hurting either between the earlobe (auricular) or around the little finger ring area (anular), indicating joint or muscle discomfort on one side of her leg.
Guard your nerves, and let blood flow as you wish.
Return and tighten on the location of incision cutting and suturing to heal the wound.
From windy conditions and those quality of wearing them (possibly referring to medical treatments or garments suitable for cold, possibly related to joint pain):
When winds from corn silk, ash wood, or wool arise,
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors: And if necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery. Then return the intestine or hernia back into its cavity; place your hand over that area so as not for the intestine to protrude out again. You have already opened up space
This joint pain that is being punctured or operated upon according to these two methods (one involving a knife and the other possibly involves heat like fire), represents one of its types for treatment: And when necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed instrument. Then return the intestine back
The joint pain treated by methods of puncture and extraction at these twelve locations in the body are described: One is performed where we pause, which lies towards the head (the end part), while from our neck down; there ventosages on the chest region near the breastbone. Also mentioned are those applied to the mouth area below the jaw using two spoons and above it over a cup's lip edge – this is likely referring to some form of oral treatment with utensils at these specific sites: And in terms of ventosages, there includes puncture techniques on twelve body parts—one involves piercing (potentially surgical), followed by extraction; the second site lies towards one'thy head region. Additional locations for treatments include areas above and below your neck down to where we put holes with spoons around or inside the mouth, as well as over a cup’s lip edge – suggesting procedures involving cups used in traditional medicine: Furthermore, there are ventosages using two lancets (sharp instruments), applied on both sides of one's breastbone and small bone knives at specific joint sites—these could be related to therapeutic interventions for pain or discomfort around those body parts. The overall description points towards various techniques used by practitioners within this medical tradition, potentially addressing issues in multiple regions of the anatomy through localized procedures that involve manipulation and possibly minor surgical-like actions with tools like lancets (knives), spoons for making holes or creating marks on specific body parts such as joints.
And extract the phlegm not from the veins thin and scattered throughout the flesh, but rather through those channels by means of flebectomy; nor does it indicate that chyle is a fever caused inside any part where there has been total expulsion within these vessels.
May it be necessary to provoke breeching due to illness or continuously, administer that immediately at the meal time of the day and night, as well as during sleep in its place and anytime else.
And when it occurs at any cause of those things, especially if it happens on the third or fourth day after they have passed through that same day in three hours, command winds to be painful as these are passed.
And when the youth of wind from the back is that which, when it concedes gravity to the head and descends into the humors in the chest; perhaps this enables the expulsion of all morbid matter from the body.
This discomfort is in the location of trepanation for the skull (or cranial). Here, "trepanation" refers to an ancient surgical procedure where a hole was drilled or scrap
And it is not unknown that one uses the part where infiltration of cold humors completely occurs or even becomes inflamed; therein lies a great detriment to them (the patient). Here refers to areas within the body, particularly joints affected by excessive accumulation and resulting inflammation from "cold" bodily fluids. The text highlights how
Therefore I do not use that part of the body where diseases are easily visible on its skin or in those headpieces (or skull and scalp). In this line, it suggests a medical approach to avoid areas showing clear signs of illness during treatment, likely emphasizing proper diagnosis before
And thus I do not use that which is often forgotten and overlooked by the physician; hence when you command the windlass to pause its movement slightly on those parts temporarily with light pressure using a cushion, they fear generating forgetfulness (or loss of awareness). Here it refers to potentially causing discomfort or neglecting certain symptoms that may require closer attention. This line underscores careful and mindful application of treatment methods in order not to overlook significant signs during medical interventions. The text appears concerned with avoiding the escalation of a patient's condition through mismanagement, advocating for attentiveness even
And the coughing is in place of trepanation for the black vein and basilica: hence I will confirm asthma (or obstructive pulmonary condition), constriction of airways ('ale'), division of lung structures, coughs, and restoration. In this line, it appears to describe an ancient medical intervention where a physician would diagnose respiratory conditions like bronchial spasms or pneumothorax (lung collapse) by manipulating the body with techniques that might involve internal 'openings' such as trepanation for veins and possibly thoracic surgeries. The mention of confirming ('confereys') these ailments implies diagnosing through physical ex
When a small vessel is inflamed and painfully pressed on slowly, it induces weakness in the body and the abdomen.
And the cooling of almond oil provides relief for headaches and eye pain, migrates away from them, suppresses the pains in the teeth'dictions (i.e., where one feels toothache), and is performed at a dental extraction site.
When you command the windlass not to press on your hand so that it does not injure an artery and cause blood flow, here is the translation:

May the warmth that is felt on the honeycomb-like surfaces provides comfort to the patient' extricated through rubbing or friction; this heat comes from increased temperatures absorbed by these areas, providing relief due to its warming properties.
E the suction of the divided parts of the focus grants excellent aid from the lithotomy of three veins, which are part of the basilica (inferior vena cava), fusca (common iliac artery), and cephalica (brachial artery); thus attaching handles to all these veins placed within them, allowing for their connection.
And order the knife not to proceed in cutting outwardly (i.dict "scarificatio"), where there is no flesh left, and immediately after remove its tendons and vessels.
E is caused by wind that blows over the abdomen and confirms with bloody sores on the anus and wounds filled with pus just now.
When you command the windlass to be a great gust of earthly air, and it is directed into places where strong contractions occur; powerful but subtle movements with cutting instruments are employed for incision (scarification).
May gentle breezes from the cushions for gradual manifestation, which drive away all ill humors of fever and phlegm in body, bladder; they alleviate past pains, discomforts both above and below the waist, prompting menstrual flow, flatulence (belching), and urination at sites suitable for cauterization or drainage by doctors.
Despite all efforts to heal the body as a whole and prevent fainting, such incidents still occur in patients' bodies.
From these breezes flows health into health from those changes of body'supinations'. Here is the line-by-line translation: From this wind, life comes to life through adjustments in the positions of the patient’s upper limbs (or "cushions"). Note that while some words may not correspond directly with modern English
From this position of the winds is that it stops and sucks in moisture early on without prolonging its presence; however, if necessary, it can pause those leaks or drippings momentarily while directing fluids to arrive by way of blood flow (or "engual"). Here's a more detailed translation: And do not cease this action and continue until you see the place become reddened and swolthy, whereupon rage of the sanction will appear.
When you scrape and repeatedly suck small amounts, pay attention in the disposition of the limbs.
When that house (body) has rare flesh of the thighs and you do not scald it with warmth to prevent its location from becoming ulcerated.
And order the suction device to intensify the scraping and apply a poultice with ease of use in mind.
If the sanction is swolthy, then cut and cleanse these parts as directed; in the first washing there emerges an undercurrent of subtlety to the body and its moisture. May occur during the second stage of acquiring knowledge about the removal of the large sancus.
If the sanction is due to fecal matter, then cut through the smooth surface of the flesh so that it continues its course as before.
When we aim to remove even just one stone from its place at once or small ones too, it suffices for us an incision.
If we wish to extract a sick humor (disease), cut it out with motion cutting; and if the sick humor is thick, let us first make an incision for cutting beforehand.
The term of cauterization in which only the depth of the spine is concerned.
If the intestine is thick, hard, black, and its pore spaces are sticky or moistened, then make these spots unctuous (lubricated), easier to dissolve; if it's summer time, add olive oil from aloe or ruined olives, honeydew jelly, cumin seed oil, or sanicle juice. And for autumnal times use honey wine, mint leaves extract, lime blossom water, and thyme decoction; to these resemble substances apply them as well.
If the excess is great and sudden, then apply honey, or balm of St. John'thyne, oil of Aloe, wine cider (vinasse), or juniper vinegar; according to their appearance.

And from that one who is of moisture's motion, washes their breath with water drawn from myrtle and sumac, or similar substances for them, here comes the treatment described:
From the one whose excesses are thick, wash their noses with vinegar from old wine or acacia water, or thistle tea of nettles or chamomile, according to their appearance.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: E cover that cleanlinency be guarded during bathing; there must also exist places where this cleansing water is applied for an hour or two hours at a time, and there should likewise be periods when one rests from such washing.
What is required for it (the patient) that should be performed by bloodletting before wind suction?
When considering the patient'thy condition: if you see that their chest and abdomen are stiffened with coldness and inflammation, possibly due to dry humors like honeycomb acetones (which may refer to certain types of sweat or thick discharges), combined with indivia and diphasal herbs, as well as dried ginger root, saltpeter, wine jelly, and their resemblances.
When their food is consumed with wine and cooked meats are served to them, along with the appearance of fleshiness:
From that of which the complexity is feverish and induces flow in breasts or alsecanavian seed mixture with honey, spice (and) aromatic herbs to smell between Christmas and Epiphany; it is recommended for them to use little beer/alcohol consumption and eating habits. Here they should pause the intake of legumes, cabbage, grains, fish, chickens, pigeons (and possibly other animals), which are held in their hands or used as food sources during this period:
When in the day of ventosification and bloodletting, it is necessary for one to drink more than food.
Even if it is given to drink in some hours at the patient'thyrtic (a specific homeopathic remedy or muscle medicine), or administered through a mouthpiece, so that the main limbs are comforted and its essence does not get absorbed; but do not give rise to swelling.
May these pains that are being cut be coughs and gout on the belly and in the joints of the knees, at those places where there is phlegm or thickness inside a chest, but none of these limbs suffer cutting upon themselves.
And it is not for these reasons but rather an affliction of the sanctum within a member, wherewith pauses like a breath upon the breastbone in melancholy madness due to the flow of bile from the sanc (gallbladder) du jaundice; and they use it such that the flighty vaporiness is dissolved both on one's abdomen and umbilicus, which then often reduces the limb size and alleviates pain as if dissipating wind discomfort.
And when pressure is applied to the reddish or purplish swellings in their limbs due to fluid accumulation and strong suction of fluids, this removes those impurities from its place.
When it seems that breath and movement are taking place in these chambdicts,
These breezes are administered with suction only, and some treatments are applied at the fire's flame.
When certain measures are fully administered in diseases of the mouth,
Here comes the first sentence to translate: It is for that wind increases and becomes thick, thus water alone or with certain plants can be poured into it.
When the form of ventosity administered at the focus is as follows: it consists of two drips (as we have formed); and the quantity of the prone [liquid] is a palm's measure; and in its place, located where it resides within the circuit, its measurement corresponds to that which enters into you with one needle.
It is pain caused by heavy stones or gravels and hard-boiled eggs (causing difficulty in maintaining the position of its limbs on it), thus, doctors advise taking restorative herbal remedies composed mainly of earthly minerals for relief.
Whenever there is a crossbow or iron flame present in front of the fireplace, then keep the candle at that location.
And this is the great wind that we have previously discussed about that which accompanies those illnesses and affects how they use it,
When liver swellings and distended abdominal pains come from other sources than those of young people and large limbs,
And the quality of applying this fire above the limb is to gradually heat a candle flame with tallow wax and pause it over the membrane in the area where swelling occurs, so that the focus can be ignited quickly before the part gets burnt by malaute.
Here is the line-by-line translation of this medieval medical text:
And with fire according to its nature, and repeat that which is digested from it if necessary.
May an air catheter be administered in the plague of diarrhea, where there is no transverse or disruption present, and it's filled only with water, resting solely on the limb.
This is how it goes: And this is the form: The more it enlarges, the better, so that it can receive a large quantity of water.
Given that "Capitol" is likely referring to an excerpt or section
When bloodletting is not administered to the limbs but where it can be applied because of their small size and proximity to veins (like teeth and gums), or in a naked part of the body, like when done with fingers near nose and lips; this refers to traditional methods used for phlebotomy.
When it is necessary to use those found in the body fluids of patients with swelling from bathing, then:
Return their positions during the day and night in water so that they are famished, but without causing any harm to the stomach of those individuals; similarly facilitate bowel movements through enema or by applying pressure on abdomen (via manual stimulation); return swelling inside the hernia back into its cavity; place pauses above them.
When filled and case occurs (when they are full of something—likely referring to a bodily condition
If it is possible to suck the substance away into the windpipe, one may draw in air more vigorthy (likely referring to a method of improving breathing or drawing fresh air). This sentence suggests that if there'
But if not, open the location for wind to enter and move water over it (meaning that without sucking in fresh air through an opening or applying pressure with flowing water as a form of treatment), then both methods are frustratingly used excessively (indicating perhaps repeated attempts at relief). The text likely describes two different
If the legs of sanctity are prolonged with cauterization using bloodsucking tools and residue remains inside (suggesting some form of bleeding or wound treatment), then you take a fresh cloth in water, place it over what is left within to prevent further exudation. Herein described may be an early practice where after the application of heat from cauterization that has caused internal bloodstains ("residue"), and if additional healing measures are needed due to continued leakage or bleeding (exudate), a fresh cloth dipped in water is used, carefully placed over this area with pressure applied externally. This could be an ancient treatment technique for w
If the sanctum is multiplied (likely referring to multiple wounds or a condition involving several body parts), powder made of triple sulphur along with coals and ashes from ignited stones are applied on it; then, wherein lies each cause sharply indicated by these materials' specific placement. Following this application, the treated area is allowed time for adherence (where likely poultices or medicinal applications have been used), after which point—the condition has ceased to exist within that part of the body ("sanc abscidit"). This text details an old method whereby powdered sulfur and ashes from heated stones are applied directly onto wounds, each dot correspondingly placed according to the sharp pain's origin. The passage likely refers to a rudimentary form of topical treatment aiming at localized issues in ancient medicine by using these substances which then bond or adhere ("adheres") when cooled and possibly aid healing processes for certain types of injuries involving
And if necessary, repeated infusions of bloodletting when possible change those humors.
If the blood clots are prohibited from suspension, then it will be inflamed at this moment or an arrow (or needle) should remain inserted within these places where the clot forms; and they shall rest until I feel any new clot coming upwards.
When you wish for a poultice on those joints, apply a little of powdered arsenicum or salt, and mix it well therewith now.
And begins the process of restoration from the clean or pure division/partition: recovery. This chapter is frequently necessary in the practice of medicine; it concerns restoration and repair for bone fractures and displacements.
Oh child, understand that these physicians and barbers boast about this chapter of our textbook today, which some may not have the liberty to read by themselves or appreciate in ancient times.
For this reason the disease of these learned men is deprived here in our land; and I have not ignored it for any time; nor did I apply anything to it afterwards except what was derived from the reading of ancient books and studies on understanding them, whereby I extracted science from those.
Return or adjust in experiments and studies throughout one'se lifetime.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Capital First. (This phrase is likely an introductory statement
Summaries and collections from the essence of bone fractures are required before we begin to recall details about the members affected by these breaks, whether one or several in number. (This translation conveys that a summary is necessary regarding various aspects related to broken bones; it appears as though some preparatory work must be done with knowledge derived from actual cases of such injuries.) Thus, in the preamble of this chapter I shall present summaries from the discourse on these matters and within which chapters we will understand what skilled craftsmen know about them; for you and they who are quick to comprehend or learn such noble arts beyond your own. (Here translation indicates that before diving into a deeper analysis, it sets out an intention to provide summaries of discussions on relevant topics—the speaker seems aimed at informing those skilled in the craft about established knowledge while acknowledging others' expertise and speedy understanding.)
And so it is said that when you experience a bone fracture or dislocation and twisting, then take care to apply pressure above where the injury occurred; if there are no other reasons preventing this action, do so with debility relief on top of it, or for what causes pain directly upon arrival at your senses, as much suffering from intense coldness or inflammation.
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
And return the intestine (malady) back to its original place in which it customarily resides, at what time or moment?
And when the bone breaks begins to be repaified, then cover it with nutritious foods rich in bulk and heavy substances; similarly feed them with wheat flour boiled in water, rice, vegetables, milk from cows, cheese curds, fresh meat, large grains resembling these, making coagulation of the fracture mixture using leeks and honey.
Be aware that the bones break when they are in people who have lost their youth and whose bodies are weakened; it is not possible for them to remain continuous or solid according to their nature due to excessive purging of body parts.
Nature may adjust and tighten over the broken bones of any part caused by excessive consumption as if it were gluttony within which you are bound together with others forming a mass, inside where poison from rich foods or heavy drinking (similar to drunkenness) cannot prevent your work.
For this reason it is necessary that we pause the foods of malady (which have gravity and viscosity/thickness), as we have said before.
And you know that the causes of bone fractures are various according to the different parts, and a fracture in the hipbone is different from a fracture in the skull'sup; and a fracture in the chest is different than a fracture in the forearm. Similarly, all other members among themselves have their differences.
And recall all types of bone fracture, each in its own section within the capital dedicated for it hereinabove mentioned.
Motion various types of bone breakage in oneself is present. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
The whole specialty is pain that specifically occurs upon restoration of the body in its respective locations after a recollection unique to those places.
Motive for bone fracture. For this translation task involving an archaic or pseudo-Latin text related to medieval medicine, here's a line by line English interpretation:
So when there is no apparent twisting or cracking upon touching the bone and joint affected by cold humors, nor does it inflict great pain on your hands, here we are not dealing with a fracture.
Have it possible that there is twist or small crack, where you touch and apply pressure to the entire body; here pause over him at times of recalling those medicines which were used in that moment when he was brought here; and place your hand tightly for gradual constriction.
Be aware that the place where it arches and does not divide into two or another which does not arrive at this seat, when your whole body is swolthy throughout, then you will commence to correct things as they happen upon arrival here by means of applied bandaging.
If an apoplexy occurs and you must apply it, let that for each day until the apoplexy ceases, applying heat according to any movement or elevation ability you have.
Given that you understand restoration and cauterization is easier than dealing with bone in the which I have fractured,
Return strength to that second which will come back as memory of him/her (referring potentially to patient' extrinsic or intrinsic body function). Here, the text instructs on how one should regain energy in a person
If the bone is broken within your body (referring to a limb), then it's necessary to extend this very member, whether that be leg or arm; use your hand if the part in question is small; otherwise apply pressure with two hands on either side of what’s fractured. Here are detailed translations:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: If your position allows for it, as parts of the limb are extended and stretched out, then proceed with returning those additional elements in accordance with each patient' extrication technique you perform there.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When you touch it at that time with your hand and if hereby any other cause appears different, correct whatsodictate by the amount of your virtue (or intention).
Excessive extension and compression, as doctors say these movements often cause apothecary' extrication during their work or result in contraction of the limb they have observed due to such actions.
And the quality of a relaxed limb is what I recommend, to know that members are diverse in their smallness and greatness, as well as in shape.
From those who are small in stature and resemble others like the arm and torchlights to them, it is necessary that their covering be a thin but refined cloth.
May those who are fat with the thigh or cushion have a covering that is tough and tight around them so that their belly does not protrude in any place within it; thus they will not show themselves outside of its boundaries.
Here begins the procedure, take your evacuation of bowels in a convenient manner for this injury at the location where that fracture has three or four layers around it; tightly hold onto one end of the bandage.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return it to its natural place in the location of the fracture, and keep your strength so that there is not a lack on which you have tightened up the area where the fracture occurred. Here is the line-by extralinear translation of each sentence:

Here comes the line to translate: Return the pause between the thighs' folds where it is wrapped with cloth, if there are signs of a broken bend in him; otherwise, there is no cause for concern herein.
Return your hand over the other bandage, and place it gently on these wrappings to prevent inflammation or infection if there is no abscess present at that location due to such intervention, apply this treatment for a few days; and tighten those strips firmly onto him.
Here come the splints of canna'thy seed, and they are formed carefully; or from wood; or branch of palm tree. And each bracelet according to this shape and form:
However, if the splint placed over that fracture is thick and a small one has been put under other splints, then adjust its length according to where it rests on the limb—its extension being proportional both in height and size; and strengthen it above these splints as per your initial restriction order; so that this restricting bandage aligns with the fracture site inside and outwardly corresponds to the extent of the break, extending further from there only when elongated by said distance.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And if there are delicate threads not suitable for tying them tightly among those waters you wish to bind together, and where between each stone or ledge there is a day'dicted period of time.
If the malady is led through the extremities of your legs to cause constriction in these places, then quickly intervene with a halter or woolen bandage so that it does not inflict injury.
Some accidents break bones and cause displacement of the vertebrae, leading to memory recall in that part at the second unique characteristic.
E understand that when all body members are broken on the first day; this causes parts of the member to become large if not paused over them for days or even a week at most, according to your certainty about the coming apothecary' extrication.
This is how medieval healers addressed the conditions that they previously repaired, which include breaks and dislocations as well as twisting injuries.
Manipulation of immobilization after bone healing is convenient for complex movements and mainly in the legs and belly; therein lies no heat or effusion: hence, grains moistened with powder are used to hold down the movement of the millstone on the stones.
When it is necessary to apply that comfort with them as well, but break open and stop the thickness of their flesh from being too soft or subtle; use that which they provide.
Other plaque of impalement fracture and dislocation: recipe for saffron, hedgehog (lapdanum), acacia, myrrh, mint, which is roasted from thousand grains of dragon's dust; mixed with mirra and dragonwort berries; ground into powder or crumbles and dissolved in water or aloe oil if the complexity of the malady has been pierced.
Other manipulations for the splint that will ease fracture and twisting: take a mixture of milk thistle from white amber dragon, myrrh and aloe vera also from white amber dragon; acacia syrup from black dragon, vine resin from Armenian dragon. .xx
All are crushed in mortar and pestle, they have pillules (or comfits) immersed or administered in water or an alummed book:
Manipulation of the splints and bones apart, causing pain in those places, a tightly wound yarn is grasped and immersed in oil and wine; it is fixed on that spot:
May not be for restoration and pain is removed properly with applied caustic and extraction thereof directly.
Other types of plaster that restore wounds include olive and poppy seed, mixed together to make the plaster itself.
Manipulation of the cast applied for bone fracture restoration and to resolve osteomyelitis: mixture of althea, clove leaves, flower heads of violes (likely referring to violets), flour from barley, all parts divided into three portions; these are ground together and bound with vine. When the limb is not cut or broken.
If it is cut (injured), then apply that same water of the colon and its fluid to heal (treat).
Other applications of plaster poured for healing purposes must restore the first limb injured: a recipe using alum and wheat germ, along with balm, mallow root, majorana, flowers from violets or chamomile, all chopped up; they are soaked in water taken freshly from spring sources or distilled waters according to their quality.
May Ipocras does not prescribe rest for the patient lying on their injured leg, but rather remedies of wax and oil, nor any other cause; it is recommended that they move between coarseness and subtlety.
May Gualia have seen that they are stops on the broken part of him and his causes for dryness due to excessive heat taken with myrrh, seeds, and spirits from those things which I recommend as remedies.
Mending of the plaster that soothes wounds and pain: recipe made from cheese crumbs, hooves or chestnut shells, and thyme; powdered and ground into paste, its poultice form is ready to apply.
May the quantity according to which you open and separate (the patient' extrication), is that if there isn't pain or bleeding nor bone fracture at their place, then do not leave them without care for days. If you feel severe pain or inflammation at the location, then bend over that area for an hour and apply a plaster from there.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return that subtlety under the small and does not strain due to your initial tightness, gently apply it where it is healing inside of you.
If at times the ulcer and soreness and pain and inflammation are already so severe throughout the body, as well as indigestion requiring enema or strictures, then repeat this treatment on the patient lying down as you have done before.
If there is no injury to any of those causes mentioned above, then wait three to four days or seven (seven being an approximation), and some care will be applied for up to twenty days after you observe the healing of the injury, as previously stated: until the fracture adheres, and flesh coagulates over it.
And when it is necessary to adjust in the tightness that may occur anywhere at all on your initial narrowing, and fasten within the belly of humors (presumably referring to body fluids), as soon as memory returns to you.
May if you find the fracture location and dry out or weaken it any further than necessary, know that nourishment is forbidden to prevent reaching this area; therefore feed that part only with water given daily for three days, apply a small poultice herein, which will supply nutriment to the limb through these means, thus healing the inflammation.
When the bones are not restored to health when still injured after being healed outside of meals and according to their twisted shape, it is a mistake in accordance with their practice, and great fear; if done rightly, they expand the ancles freely while soaking them.
Even if they have not seen an elder of theirs use it before, it is reasonable that they do not apply it.
Capitol second: When a bone is broken in the head.
The spices of breaks are motions, and their forms are various, the causes distinct, some from percussion on space (fractures), which immediately enters into the cranium where it is felt in the head as a painful sensation; or when pressure marks through an incision upon bone, cutting flesh without penetrating to below the skull. This type of fracture injury is called dislocation absolute lift-off (literally elevated out).
E from these joints the children are either large or small in size, and of fractures they have been crushed or dislocated; it is caused by percussion on stone (for treatment), causing their appearance to change.
This break or entrance has already been applied to the periosteum (the outer layer of bone), and either it is large or small in these broken bones' areas; if it penetrates into the bone itself, then this occurs on the face of the bone.
And when there is a bone breakage, it occurs in the subtlety of the hair strand and thus this particular kind of microscopic fracture does not get named.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Mostly it hurts in the bones of our joints when they become dry like phlegm (cough).
So for all these heavy bruises that have been laid upon us like separate planks (steles), they are treated as splints. When all this fluid returns to its place in the body.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
A special vessel is known for having been discovered under the bone, and it has been removed from there; where now a black fracture appears.
When treating fractures consider the accidents of humours, and if through these accidents signs manifest pain, vomiting from cholera, distension, loss of understanding, abscesses, syncope, acute fever, examination of their fluids and requests, as well as appearances corresponding to those injuries in major dispositions, they do not heal.
If an accident occurs due to misalignment (or disharmony), then you begin healing for them.
The cause is such that when the inflammation comes into your stomach during feverish days on the twelfth day throughout the entire disposition of your bones, cover it with care as you study its effects upon the skeleton in the eleventh hour before noon.
If it is in the summer days, when you press your cheeks with your hands throughout the day, and because the skin has been corrupted by sweat (or humoral imbalance), then problems arise that have already been recommended to treat them.
If the fracture has already reached the meningeal covering of the brain and consists of small fragments and arthritis, then it is necessary to insert the broken parts carefully as recommended by you (doctor).
Here comes the sentence to translate: When you raise the head of the hernia and discover it on the upper part of the body according to your ability, allowing it to lie over the hernia.
If you have caused the bone to crack or developed an ulcer that bleeds profusely, then immediately press on it with clean water and bandage the wound soaked in wine and olive oil; this will allow the inflammation from the fracture/ulcer to rest while keeping moistened linens applied undernethy patient's legs and chest. You are holding their hands for support (translation may vary slightly due to archaic language interpretation).
And it is one of two methods for operation.
The one thing is that you insert the instrument into the body as follows, and this is how it should be done: Insert another smaller tool than that; here's how it should be done.
And apply medicine or poultices as needed for the second day.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "When various instruments of cutting are used by me and I continue using them for others; when these tools made from iron or steel become blunt at the ends of their use on the extremities, they should be named accordingly.
When they use it for gentle tapping on the joints, in order not to hit the head and lead that one along.
If the bone is strong and hard, then break it in its course before you administer the needles on the pillows which they are not deepening into.
E for there is no name given here but these that are stopped below the bone of the chest until they reach the extent of the skull's boundary or edge upon which it seems a small margin or circle, thus preventing submersion and passing through the hardness of the bone.
It is convenient that you grasp these many ladders of which each one corresponds to the precision required for any part of the body in your present state, whereby the sharpness (degree) within all areas of the brain's extremity shall be according to the extent of such preciseness.

When the nose is broken, or fractured. (This translation attempts to convey a common phrase related to facial injuries
You know that it is not the nose itself which gets broken but rather different parts of one's body; sometimes there are several warnings before this happens, as now you have two or three bones cracked (the nasal bone), and these fractures indicate a grinding motion inside—this refers to bruises. The phrase suggests that when it comes to nose injuries involving broken parts of the face rather than just noses themselves, there are signs like multiple small cracks in the bone structure before they get severe (e.g., facial dislocations), and these symptoms could signal internal grinding or twisting movements inside—implying potential concussion from impacts that might not be immediately apparent on superfthy examination but rather seen within as bruising, which alludes to the idea of subtle trauma being an indicator for
If one of the parts gets broken (implying a nose injury), you must interpose your finger in its place within their nostril and hold that fractured fragment there—this is what it indicates as being "in dislocation," meaning displacement, which should be held until returning to normal position. The translation explains an old method of first aid for nasal bone injuries where one would gently reposition the broken nose piece back into place and hold pressure with a finger in its nostril while expecting natural alignment or restoration over time under medical supervision if needed, though such practices are now considered outdated by modern medicine standards. And that for your sake to make it easier and remember not to harm the area of operation (in this context likely referring back to handling or attempting first aid on a fracture). Here, there's an added cautionary note emphasizing care when dealing with injuries in order not to cause further damage. This line stresses gentle treatment during any intervention
If the fracture is in the upper chest portion of the body and does not go towards it, then cover with a bandage applied directly to the part wherein there lies the broken bone (the injury site).
If there is a break in two parts of the body, then you make it seem as though this (the broken bone) was already present beforehand.
And if you can restore the wound in the patient on the first day of the fracture, that is ideal; otherwise, apply rest for seven or eight days after the period of cauterization (aposteme).

If you do not cleanse the ulcer with caution, then apply that which is made of sage seeds and pomegranate peel powder ground in alum; place it over the wound baseplate (le stoppa leone), without touching the nose by any means.
If bones of the nose are slightly broken or displaced, then you must separate them here and take out those instruments that correspond to these; apply pressure where there is a fracture, using fluid (like blood) as contained within it for healing and bandaging according to necessity.
If you crush worms in the nose, cover that which heals with lime and insert iron tubes into it for complete recovery.

When there's a fracture of the jawbone, it can be referred to as a mandibular fracture or simply broken jaw
When the jawbone is broken and there's also displacement (meaning it has not only fractured but moved out of its normal position), if the break consists of just one piece without any bending or deformation towards parts, then such an injury might be considered less severe. Here "lesser" implies that while significant damage to the jawbone structure exists due to displacement and misalignment (deformed into separate pieces in this context suggesting possible comminuted fracture), it may not require as extensive or complicated treatment compared to a break with more complex deformation which could indicate multiple breaks.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the jawbone is broken into two pieces, then provide an extension of force to push it back together so that movement becomes possible for them.
If you apply pressure on the tooth causing disruption, then firmly press those parts wherein you hope it will break through silver or gold (or copper), and place your pause above the broken jawbone cauterized with metal filament, along its length from the chin; also position that portion of a single gauze under which dressings are applied to this area when clothing is put on you. Here, it instructs how one should apply specific pressure points and materials like metals or gauzes for dental disrugy treatment without damaging existing treatments such as cauterizations with metal filaments at the jawbone site.

And when that bandage is applied and the position of the bone is not altered, let it stay like this so long as the fracture heals slowly over three months.
If another lapse of rheum occurs as a result of the treatment we have applied previously within that which lies in their abdomen (belly), then administer what has been provided for those lapses and cure this eruption accordingly.

When the wishbone is broken and separated into two parts that do not fit together again (like bones no longer matching after being severed), it poses challenges for restoration in a restaurant setting: either there's difficulty returning to normal activities within such settings, suggesting significant disruption or inconvenience; alternative methods are needed if one cannot manage without external assistance—meaning that the patient may require help from others (like caregivers) to cope with daily tasks and dining experiences. If not provided for in situational supportive services (referring again metaphorically to healthcare or aid), it might be impossible ('ayssi') due to ongoing impairments, highlighting the potential long-term difficulties that can accompany such an injury; furthermore, if left unattended and not properly addressed by a skilled professional—
When the broken wishbone requires attention ('la operacio en aquella'), it means two roles must be filled: one hand (the tengu) assists and holds together the fractured wing bone; while another, possibly a caregiver or medical professional, extends support to assist with other aspects of their condition—this implies coordinated efforts are needed between patient assistance ('tengua') for physical stability and additional help in managing daily tasks associated with injury recovery.

So if the fracture is near the muscle' extrinsic part, you must pause the tendon above and below it immediately; also quickly attend to the injury with your hands as well.

And only when either the large or small fire is broken, and they are all torn asunder (either by accident or intentional damage).
When the small fire below (possibly referring to a heating or warmth source), its restoration is relief and it puts their health back in order/better condition.
When the patient's fire (body energy) is broken for a long time after an injury to their body, healing becomes difficult.
Put salt from that when those bones are broken down.
So if the bone that has been broken is undernethy (the smaller one above), it becomes necessary for a doctor to restore it until such time when this can be done with ease inside where said limb will become strong again.
If the large fire is what causes it (the pain), then when you press down firmly on it, hold back its spreading out forcefully.
If the two flames are joined together tightly, then when you pause their withdrawal forcefully press upon them.
When the figure of the hand must be restrained and extended over a limb, place their palms on the parts below it, put all others in position as well, placing each ear at the base of those other points, and gently lift up the patient's chest with this structure.

This suggests that one should avoid any unnecessary manipulation which could worsen an injury. Instead, restrained care is advised until professional assessment and treatment can be provided.
When you injure the finger's phalanx or dislocate it (fracture/dislocation), cover it with clean cloth and apply pressure evenly for as long as necessary; simultaneously place your hand over the extended area to prevent further injury of the affected digit. This instruction indicates immediate first aid measures, emphasizing immobilization ("keep covered") until medical professionals can assess and manage the situation effectively. The use of consistent applied pressure may be aimed at controlling bleeding or providing comfort while awaiting additional help; placing a hand over an extended area could serve as temporary stabilization
Extend the broken bones and have them aligned by someone skilled (the doctor).

May it be so that if the fracture is in those places mentioned herein (the knee area), or at this spot (where indicated), hold and fix with what was applied to that specific part; otherwise continue placing them according to continuation, which would be better, or pause over a small stone like we have for our foot.
Consider the arrangement of applied and opposed cautions during healing—that which is done when addressing any cause brought up in your account as it unfolds.

The restoration of a hip bone fracture.
The bones of the thigh crumble and are declared according to what is converted into disembodiment below, in that place where it protrudes above (the body).
The restoration of the patient is done so that the sinew tightens over the fracture and another ligament shortly afterward; the humors are pressed down on their abdomen and face.
When the minister extends it entirely according to its quality where the bone breakage occurs in the joint of the bone:
May it be beneficial to the thigh's bone marrow, then tie down firmly with silk thread at the part of the femur joint, thus preventing excessive extension in those areas and also securing another piece of thread for the fracture.
If the break is susceptible to dampening (moisture), then apply linen properly soaked in water and extend it over the parts immediately.
Here the doctor wraps the two parts of their body together as naturally and with good union; provided that he does not immobilize it for a fracture (apostem). If an ulcer appears in you, then apply it for several days until the ulcer heals, and return to your care regimen.
The constriction of it is suffering: cover that which encases the fracture with a hard bandage, fold it twice or thrice for some days, and reduce its excess; then wrap another covering within so that reaches up to the ankle and backside of the thigh.
Here inserts a long staff between the thigh and knee joints of each body parts, as directed by those who have bandaged her wounds well; they turn it over on the leg area where there is excess from the bandage for healing purposes.
Return your pause over the knee joint at that location of her breakage, and maintain a pillow above their shoulder bone as well.
Return and fill the empty spaces between the sheet'dictum (couch or bed linen), ensuring that any discharge is allowed to clot.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: When pressure begins at a strong point of heat over the location of the fracture within three or four layers/envelopes and as you move away from the site of the fracture, your pain becomes less intense and lubrication is applied with more moisture.
Here the tendons of the hand are extended to the parts entering when they reach the cavity of the foot, and gently stretched by the other ends of their sticks until they do not go out from their place again.
Here comes the sentence to translate: Apply pressure on that area so as not to injure the corroding or inflamed limb nor cause an abscess; if any of these conditions are caused by it, then rub yourself and correct what has been mentioned above in regular practice.
If bone is pushed against the other which has been pressed upon it by you, then immediately press that second part; if not possible, apply pressure to this place and cure what was remembered before healing begins.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And some measures are strenuous for this hip fracture, as we have mentioned in the aid and on the arm.
Even after such treatment in this manner does not heal the cramped thigh; and if it is restored alone, another cushion must be applied there, so that they continue walking with that leg which was previously affected.
You understand that the thigh is tense for up to ten days or a few months and everything depends on the complexity of conditions and other available means.

Thus, it may be understood as suggesting gentle movement is avoided until professional care can
If it is indeed just a crack or dislocation in their parts (shoulder), and only if the patient feels able to move without severe pain: "plagia" translates here as restraint ("rest") necessary for healing, implying that movement should be limited until professional medical help arrives. This maintains adherence with traditional treatment wisdom where one must carefully assess motion in relation to injury and comfort levels before proceedwards are made towards recovery or further action:
The restoration of the patient is achieved by applying water that has been broken up from their parts, and joining them together in a way that can be accomplished quickly for horseback riding (and ease) as well as construction purposes.

When vinegar is applied to the two bones of the arm, and by virtue of that application healing occurs there as well as in the arm itself, then this operation belongs entirely to him/her (the practitioner).
If there is an opening between two bones, then the cushion becomes all parts of it.
If the bone is quivering undernethy pressure, then the cushion becomes divided into parts as far downwards (Denant).
If there is a fracture in your bone, then immediately treat it now, and these are the causes that are not within your control.
Accordingly administer stretching and exercise of the joints according to that manner of treatment.
Even if the wound on the scabbard is not deep and bleeding profusely, make it swell up and place pressure with your action to control blood flow. And rely on your willpower herein.
When there is any cause for operation on the arms, and when you clamp down with tongs that complete the entire surgery, taking wooden pincers made of ash wood which has been allowed to dry after use at once where causes are paused in soles (likely referring to setting fractures), they will be used as forceps. Place these tools on what is being considered for growth removal and do not involve fingers; the length should correspond with that of the limb, and insert into it so quickly afterwards when entering pus afterward does not enter your hands.
Envelop a cloth over each garment according to its length, and pause one on the division of the cushion for each leg, ensuring they are within the putrid matter at the foot' extraneous part (presumably referring to an area affected by infection or inflammation).
Return the limbs' pins to three locations of pain and at nighttime, here is where they are not allowed to touch each other on both right and left sides for good measure.

From the breakdown of the ankle and bones in the leg and foot.
Although the foot does not break entirely; it's possible that some bones in the leg will have breaks; and when broken by them (the legs), they are only fractured within their joint spaces, where things get arranged according to positioning needs.
If the bones of the foot have been broken and sometimes those bones are raised above them, then let the humors stop in their place on the earth prepared for this purpose with antidotes administered herein.
Return the foot over what is lifted from those bones, and apply lime to them, then massage these limbs back into their places.
And apply pressure with an elastic bandage and place it under the patient's abdomen in which there are two small cups attached.
Return strength to that part of the body which lacks structure and have wrapped it in cloths along with other potential reasons for their condition. (Here's a line by line translation:
When three or four days have passed, then you loosen the bandage, and grate away the broken bones that are either fractures or dislocations, thus completing these operations with joints (probably referring to limbs affected by injuries).

The text provided is written in an archaic form of language that draws from Latin
This sentence appears to be describing a bone break, specifically mentioning the "coccyx" (tailbone) of women and possibly referring to breaks in both legs ("os pedis") as well as potentially involving other structures like ligaments or muscles ("vergua").
When the tailbone of a woman is broken (note: in modern medical terminology this would likely refer to fractures involving different bones such as sacrum or coccyx), she should lie on her back with one small part inclined towards, and be supported by something behind. This translation suggests an old method where the individual was positioned carefully for immobilization due to a spinal injury rather than what we would typically refer to in today's context as "fractured tailbone.
And place the matron on top of the potion, and pain is in it as hope; and put the maid into motion little by little until all that has gone out comes back inside where the body part (probably referring to the womb) was during coitus with desire.

And if it is necessary that its borders be sealed and kept for two days since the treatment has been applied, enter until healing occurs.
When the bones of either male or female become cracked, apply treatment and massage to that person'dict body fluids we have recommended for their hip joints.

When a bone is broken in an infant, the treatment for it often involves:
With such an injury where you apply pressure to the fracture on plaster, and primarily if your arm is significantly swollen like that of the thigh or assistant's limb, which resembles what we treat when performing amputation here today as described by our fellows.
If the child vomits after taking it in, then you must hold them down so that they do not spill over and regurgitate again if there is another cause for their discomfort.
When beginning restoration of the fracture on that day, do not extend it further unless gangrene sets in.
May you apply cauterization if there is an ulceration present, so that the healing of it can take place within one day until when said ulceration has receded and not on the third to fourteenth days in total; during this period, avoid causing any bad accidents.
If the bone is broken and protrudes above the neck (the point of breakage), then it must be reduced, which will make that very easy for you to handle and apply only a little extension.
May it not be your preparation and the equipment of you, then reduce that here with yours; this thing made of iron will have a length of seven or eight digits, its width according to the size of the patient—these are tools for me (the doctor).

Be very careful not to strain the child who has a fracture; this is what doctors have warned us repeatedly, and an accident could occur that harms your sickness or worsens it severely. If it is a looseness of bone that tightens and differs from other types of fractures.
If the child is large or small and fears those harmful accidents upon them that they have recommended, causing pain in the area above where it rests, do not stop over these pillows; perhaps you may bring it to this hard covering of sheets within the bed space and hold onto their hands.
When once or twice a day the patient begins to sweat itching (rash), which is generated under that cloth where you have placed your pad for absorption, and apply honey on these spots as per our custom when treating rashes with bee'dictum medicines mixed together.
And when you have prepared the ligament and considered the swelling in any part of the body during daytime or evening until it is consolidated and closed, ensure that the limb is ready for treatment according to this method.
If the child passes through days without rest and recovery is not achieved nor does it cease to be attached at its place, then understand that small pains are occurring there which you must investigate in order to prevent further attempts by the body (or 'plagia'). From those satagias (likely referring to the excess or accumulation of something harmful) that are separated and extracted from them, those which cannot be separated and place their limbs causing pain; for you, take note of each one according to what is possible in your ability.
If you crush the soft parts or joints (accidez), they will swell, which is either inflammation or decay and rot of some kind; then it's necessary to pause pressure on one of those same humors that have been brought for healing as described in this chapter.
When the fluid in which I hold my speech is present and you perform this task before me with your hands on the patient's thighs (and shoulders) as if they were those of large members, do not presume to draw it out or remove it for long periods driven by excessive bitternthy urges; have mercy on that which lies within where pus accumulates and treat it accordingly.

In English translation: "The knotting that occurs during these movements in the healing site of a fracture is mostly at joints, and it appears to be associated with how much force or movement on the limb; for this reason doctors forbid its usual operation." This passage discusses concerns regarding natural body motions impacting the knotting (a possible reference to scar tissue formation) during healing from a fracture. It emphasizes that these movements, especially at joints where more force is applied or there's significant movement of an injured limb post-fracture, can influence how and if such natural processes occur after the injury
Thus consider the recent knotting and administer in such remedies that have staunched blood flow to these areas; apply some or all of those treatments herein mentioned: worms, snails (eels), pepper, mirrans, and similar substances. Apply pressure with garlic cloves, raw onion slices, or gauze bandages tight enough for proper constriction over the knotting in linen cloth; compress firmly to effectively control these areas of concern. This segment provides guidance on how specific remedies were historically applied topical treatment methods that included localized compression with natural materials and substances believed by ancient practitioners (likely medieval or Renaissance) to aid healing, particularly when addressing the formation or management of knots—which could be interpreted as either literal interpretations involving physical injuries related to fractures, dislocations, sprains resulting in scar tissue that forms and behaves like a 'knot,' or metaphorically representing internal imbalances addressed through home remedies. The directive suggests an immediate application of natural agents for constriction—a practice not uncommon before the widespread use of modern pharmaceuticals, aiming to reduce bleeding (hence 'staunch') and promote healing in these ailments or inj

May cramping and knots be recent occurrences; if they are in the water vessel where your thighs reside (probably referring to a bladder or vascdict), take them away using poultices made from aloe, fennel seed, mustard, and similars—these substances also serve those on their legs. Apply these external remedies as healings with diallacrion applied well; or use the mucillage of fennel seeds mixed with hog's grease (or olive oil) for this purpose, and apply it here too—these being fatty fish concoctions ground into flour and poultices made from fleece. These are remedies named after medicinal women that provide consolidation of the body.

The provided Latin-like phrases appear to be related to a discussion on joint displacement or some
In translation: The speech concerns the treatment of joint displacement from any point within its locale, which prevents motion and necessitates intervention for a dislocated limb; this causes great pain in the groin area as well as large bruises or injuries.
So when you decrease the displacement of a joint, do so quickly and without delay; if delayed, it becomes fixed in place, making reduction difficult due to fluid accumulation there.
Through so much haste that there is neither gout nor inflammation in the hour of anesthesia, but moderate movement brings on pains and cramps.
When you apply heat, then cover yourself with the fomentation of the abdomen, and let it rest until the inflammation subsides; also wrap your member in water cloths dipped from head to toe, for ease of movement.
Every part of it is cured with the same water from which its memory will return there, in its place.
And when the displacement comes as follows after a fracture, from the upper portion enters into the lower portion.

Based on the fragment you've given, which translates to "From the reduction of the muscle dislocation," here’s a possible interpretation and
The provided Latin-like sentence in English roughly translates to: "You know that the muscle is not dislocated but by three ways, one of which occurs when it's torn away from its place." This suggests an understanding or observation related to conditions where a muscle may be affected. Here’s breaking down each part for clarity and translation into English line-by-line:
The second is that it has become dislocated above the muscle joint, and pain occurs herein; it does not concern the joints behind for the shoulder blade or in front due to nerves.
Mostly it is a dislocation and displacement outside of these parts that are tapped on the skin surface above where blood vessels course through (the areas with thinner flesh), there they become dislocated; possibly also in those places where muscles protrude, illness seeps out due to difficulty.
When ardor is directed towards the abdominal area through palpation or casting out (percussion/cauterization), and their body has already been twisted due to a previous displacement, it is subjected to treatment for inflammation.
Now cover that which you have spoken is overly exposed and now proceed with the treatment of it.
Here comes the translation line by line:
If it is a dislocation of either leg or shoulder and you have caused visible touching without fear, do not be afraid.
From this dislocation it is feared that reduction will occur when cold and inflammation ensues in the malady.
When the reduction of it is for lifting its mass to the lower parts below; and pause gives them timely rests from their pullings, and strengthens that joint in its place therein, and elevates its mass upwards into those places again, giving a pause afterward so as to return gradually.
May it return if not returned already, and as for the commensal that occurred today, then we bathe (the inflamed) malady in tail water and administer brown algae to soften and lineages with high-altitude chestnuts, fenugreek, honey in tail water, which is also given.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to reduce this second manner: and make present a home that is long than the limb (the affected joint or area), belonging from there (belonging within it, implying originating in the body's own humors/fluids), insert your muscle quickly into the space of the malady immediately upon its elevation to above-air level by another servant who pulls upward on this home. May it be that the hernia protrudes (is out), and you see what else causes its suspension, in order to seriously address this situation; once identified, then we can take immediate action for correction or restoration of position.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another reduction method is this: make a long staff with which figure can be taken away like a broomstick, that it should not be thick nor subtle; place its pause at the head of the stick lying on the ground as if lined with mortar, and let the part holding down below stay there without movement. Let it lie straight over the top of the staff's padlock, stretching out to each other piece from time to time according to their strength, so that when they are extended together for power, the joint returns quickly back to its place by speed.
If it is difficult to reduce him for all the reasons mentioned above, then use this treatment: grasp a staff with its length equal to two arm'se lengths and hold that stick vertically so that the top of it aligns with the chest button according to this method.
Ensure that clothespins are placed on top of their head, so that it does not protrude from the waistband.
Here the humoral excess is settled in the groin area immediately and arms are extended over it into the divisions just as quickly; similarly, the staff rests on assistants and arms and hand extremities.
Return your arm on an inclined plane according to the direction indicated by latitude, and stretch it out over the joints immediately afterwards; another limb is suspended from the other, where they meet internally at this point.
When the internal part of the patient is completed according to any possible manner and you pause intermittently his spinal cushion made from wool or alum dye with these quantities; a plaster massage prepared using powdered lead mixed with water, applied throughout all muscles until he turns over (assuming this helps him turn), continuous gentle manipulation of the spinal cushion on strictures, and his body is attached to its collarbone while lying down. It should not be said that his chest pad remains in place for seven days without muffling it up.
When food from indigestion is stopped and the body member feels comfortable, then it's placed on recovery.
Return food is given more and it's exercise with movement; therefore, if he closes himself up and does not soften, then already he gets well.
If the joint is dislocated due to humidity that you have caused or for another reason, then in that case apply three kinds of cautery as described in the treatise on cauterization.
If all this pain is present and the ligament or joint isn'thy not sealed for seven days, then reduce swelling on it occasionally with plasters/bandages; they will not be fixed in place nor prevent that arm from being raised to body parts above, as you know that their nerves are either located at the muscle head (cephalad), or extensions and mollifications.
Of the dislocation that you experience in your chest and thighs or parts behind them, reduction is done by forceful movement within where it returns to its normal position upon intervention.
When it is administered in that other stricture, and cure for it lies within being healed.
If you harden the body'gyma in their limb and slow down movement, then let humoral excess be washed away through bathing until that gravity is relieved and they return to their original state of health.

The provided text appears as an explanation or guideline in the context of medical examination and treatment for shoulder dislocation according to medieval or classical texts influenced by Latin language structures:
When you encounter hernias and reduce the displacement as much as possible until it heals after a cauterizing treatment, which is difficult if an abscess has formed; most of these are caused by all other species of dislocation and greater pain, accompanied often with urgent visits to those places.
When the restoration is possible, it means that their body should be extended with hands and arms spread out, and doctors or attendants stand on the hips and press down on the joints of his limbs until they return to their proper place, thus bringing them back into position.
If the dislocation is at the joints ahead, return as quickly as possible and bend it back to its place; when doing so, press on the area where you can feel the knee with your hand (located in the palm of your own).
If the displacement does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and strong motion.
When two ministers stretch out their arms and hold them together so that nothing is torn asunder.
And turn your arm completely over it (the patient), placing a long cloth or cord around the area of focus on them, binding tightly.
When the doctor touches the joint, apply some oil here to help with the lubrication of the joint and then press firmly on it until it returns to its original position; these are the causes that assist in this matter for ease of movement.
Here comes the sentence to translate: And for its reduction that has been placed on top of where there is stiffness and effusion in the place where fluid accumulthy are present under pressure due to strictures descending from above, with arms hanging down by bracing them.
And if it is necessary for it (the condition) to be loosened, and therefore when the joint formation occurs at that place, then loosen its ligaments and ease that position.
If you see the joint not strong or stiffened, then repeatedly apply the plaster and bandage, leaving it in place for several days until it is no longer extended; subsequently return that as well.
If you apply gravity to the reduction of the joint and its position is in movement, then administer moisture with warmth delicate touches, until it heals; if at that point a hernia appears above the movable fatty lymph node (which may indicate inflammation), securely bind it there, and place it on the bones of the chest and back during day and night. Here comes the first sentence to translate: Return that one and immerse it; when boiling, rub the joint where cold has congealed with warmth alternately for a day and another time (the third), holding their hands. Am inserted into that which is within (the body'thy cavity).
If you wish, rest on that moist and split cow'se edge and strain upon it; apply some times, then the place will become dry and return to its proper disposition.

The dislocation of the limb is some kind of displacement and its correction lies in other joints; perhaps even more urgent recovery when it comes to realignment at the moment or while an apatemyc (or avulsion fracture) occurs, whereby the location becomes immobilized. Here'dictation appears as a multilingual medical account detailing procedures for treating dislocations and emphasizes prompt action in case of joint displacement potentially leading to further complications that require immediate intervention such as apatemyc or avulsion fracture which necessitate quick stabilization, often by immobilizing the affected site.
The reduction of the dislocation is that you stop the joint between the thigh bone and pelvis on a table, and the attendant extends this part, while the doctor places his hand or palm over the imminent joint intersection, pushing it back to its proper place.
Even if it is considered that the palm has been placed on the belly of her (the patient), then let the humors be extended and reduced; and if dislocation comes before, place her body so that its abdomen rests upon a table to ensure that the doctor's belly covers this impending joint.
And if it returns soon, all is well; but if not, that part will harden and become an abscess, and you cannot cure nor treat with the reduction of its pressure applied today.
Indeed the knee joint according to its curvature; and there is nothing in the bladder causing it, but rather that the matter has become softened, and you cannot strengthen any cause for this—knowing that your nerves have been twisted or shattered, so do not engage them herein with cautery aimlessly.
So when the patient retracts, place your hand on what we have applied to them for this condition (presumably gout), and their limbs will be stretched out over it; meanwhile they should lie down with that layer upon them for days, while also being cut off from food.
If the patient' extrinsic motion is absent and feels pain in there due to some gravity or coldness of water/frosty conditions, then apply warmth until they are relieved (alleviated).

When any joint of those two (perhaps referring to the hands or abdomen) is dislocated from its natural position at the palm or in the belly/abdomen area, one must hold that part and apply pressure firmly until return. This advice indicates a primitive first aid approach where manual manipulation may be used—with caution as there's potential for further injury if not done correctly. The phrase "entro que retorne" means ensuring it returns to its proper place, which aligns with the traditional understanding of setting disloc
Hold up (or provide support) for the head of that particular joint which was dislocated and suspend it in place above ground level or resting position; keep this arrangement going for two days at a minimum to allow healing before reassessment, according to these instructions from historical medical practice. This statement is about immobilizing an affected limb—likely the upper extremity
Hold up and extend that part until it's properly aligned for its place in today (the current day). Here, the directive seems to be about aligning a dislocated joint back into position carefully while providing support or immobilization during this process—perhaps as an immediate treatment measure
Whenever necessary (indicating that the dislocation should not be ignored), keep it aligned with what's described in that account/narration, and do not allow for displacement during daylight hours; instead hold onto this position at night time—and continue doing so until firm. This sentence likely pertains to a routine or protocol wherein the joint must remain immobile except when specifically mentioned (perhaps as part of an ancient remedy), with specific attention given to its care after dark, implying that healing may occur better during these times due to various belief systems in historical medical practices. The use of "st

From the treatment of vertebral displacement in pairs." - This line translates to English and refers generally to medical intervention aimed at addressing issues with
When any of the vertebrae in the back or neck is dislocated and fractured outrightly (in situ), it cannot be treated here; rather, death must ensue within the womb." - This line suggests that if a spinal injury occurs where bones are severely displaced from their usual position to an extent not repairable in this setting ("here"), and these severe fractures happen "in situ" (directly), it is too grave for treatment, leading instead directly to death. The term “womb” implies the unborn child or fetus who would be at risk
A sign of the womb's expulsion (miscarriage) is that it goes against one’s will, and cannot be retained; hence, we soften or mollify their limbs/body parts here or there with cushions for them ('of him'), a spinal column from his location [or an inserted pin], which after initial insertion must also remain fixed while treatment is provided. After the removal of these objects (the pins), they are divided into four sections to be treated accordingly.
So now it is inflamed at the posterior parts and has no sign of purpling.
May the cure of it be that if there is a yellowish discoloration due to youthfulness, neither is its treatment nor recovery for this entire thing.
Might enter for examination or by touching to those areas directed towards recovery; might they already have discussed the curative speech in detail, from which I return with insightful understanding—might you also open and remove what causes discomfort from therein, due to its proximity bringing about clearer comprehension of their situation.
From those it is not healed except for that which you apply directly into them, as recommended by the water they possess.
And the humidity is spread over his face above the chest due to moisture from breathing, and it extends quickly downwards such that it does not touch his chest.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: E apone an ullu graffe reticulat sia sospitatus, set in terra firma fundamentalis pug entrancia super caput suum, et alii ulla fusti armature omni potentissimis pesibus eius extremitatem.
The minister holds a staff and does not leave it in the hole; another minister holds the second form like that.
Here comes the translation:
Here the minister extends the ligament to the part of the trunk, but they should not be tightened between the two staves and their joints where they are fixed; nevertheless (but), as we have said before.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: The doctor places his hands on the spine for strength as he returns it backward into place, and adjusts their weights within that position until they return.
May it not return through this manner, then take a table of which the length or breadth is three cubits, and carve into the wall where we have stated that the malady resides in an interstice between the ends of this table. Here is the translation line by line:
If you wish to turn the part that has been revolved above it; and you must stay on your back with the head of malady at the end of two sticks, whose lengths are one arm's length each, plus where the heads meet is a palm-length, therein already made in any stick which turns while being carried over land so that nothing else may happen to it.
And if it is a wooden staff that he holds and turns in both arms of the two sticks,
In the limb there is a defect where it forms the staff' extruded length which equals a handful of water when turned over, and in both other staves they appear similar to that one.
Return strength to the ligaments you have stretched in the groin of your thigh where it must be returned by lifting, and return those that are stretched between the knees back into place so they can support their legs again.
Return each one and place them in their proper position with the aid of a minister who turns them as directed by the doctor (and possibly others).
And place the spine back in position, and secure it with glue made from albumen (egg white), and apply wax; let this mixture thickly coat the joint of the vertebrae where displacement has occurred, over which the traction table's pulley is set up at three or four turns to pull out until movement disappears.
Return its ligaments as stated before and insert the patient's humors into where they will heal inside to restore health.
If there is any chance of healing at the end of recovery, it has been recommended that they be administered medicines to moisten and cleanse for a long time, which we have advised; and now such medicine has already been applied in this location with iron plates.

Capitolo XXVI. (This indicates that it is Chapter 26
Chapter XXVI pertains to the treatment of a dislocated hip. Here's how one might
Chapter XXVI discusses that the hip joint and muscle connection may only become dislocated without much force (not merely by chance), focusing on not causing pain at other smaller body parts or concave structures where injuries might happen otherwise when you cause harm to these areas. Here's a more comprehensive translation:
The joint of the wide is dislocated according to four ways, it can be dislocated at the divisions of these parts, or in front of them, above them, behind them, or under them.
Mostly it is displaced in various parts of the body and scarcely at or behind these areas.
When the dislocation of limbs is present among these parts it becomes long and hard to manipulate that which was healed within there; hence I apply pressure here causing bleeding from what used to be healthy, so that the head (the top part) of this hernia comes down into place. Here comes the first source sentence translated line by line:
And if that person'dicts displacement is at the parts beyond (i.e., distal to joint), then their accidents are contrary to this one.
E whosoever has dislocated their parts may experience pain at the joint above where they are placed on the couch so that it cannot move further; and if urine flows out of them when this happens (implying a possible injury to the bladder), an abscess forms inside, making walking difficult. They must walk with crutches on their feet for support.
Here comes the sentence to translate: The name of that person whose dislocation does not expand the joint or bend what is already bent therein, and who has a short leg placed where it should be in relation with others, which cushion calms down the joints, and the head of the thigh belongs to this place.
May the reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and indeed if the dislocation is old and ancient, it has already been addressed by your provided reductions here at home according to its disposition; therefore, there'se no need for further attempts in that treatment. And so now we can proceed with other concerns.
In the one where dislocation has recently occurred, and it is one of the four species of dislocation, then turn your head to restore the joint and extend that position to the parts before and after, as well as left and right sides; when this action returns strength without needing other treatments.
May it be that if the patient does not return in this manner, you must prepare strong medicines and extend the cushion placed under them from time to extraneous times or even more than usual; another servant extends such medicine above there where previously nothing was applied—and yet they tightly bind a rope over its length. Another attendant stretches out that same thread upwards, applying it directly atop their joints' tendrils; and with additional force secure the ends of this line upon each other so firmly bound together above there on top (of or near) said cushion to ensure immobility: tightening a rope over the thigh bulge in such fashion that no part escapes its grasp.
When it extends from this point or below the shoulder joint to the shoulder joint itself, or from the chest joint down to the back joint.
When all of these are extended within a period until the malady is raised to its head above ground and begins to break down,
This particular type of extension is common among all four (likely referring to different body parts or types).
So if the displacement returns with water we have mentioned, then do so; but if not, it is necessary for everything special that I can say about its treatment.
In the reduction of oneself, when dislocated and displaced to their parts, so that wickedness is raised upon one'thy back; and pause the ligaments in the place between the thigh at which they are located where the head of the thigh meets the location for lowering them down; and extend those ligaments along the part of the shoulder joint towards either end portion of the breastbone.
Here comes the next sentence to translate: "Apply another strong minister of cauterization on their wrists, and heat up heavily in the hollow parts of the affected thigh for effective retraction; that will return to its place.
This particular species is of purulent exudation for which this member has been reduced, and it concerns the other substances as well.
If you are able to stand on your feet and not yield to this particular method of treatment for all, then the two legs at the base of the thigh will bear us well together with both heels and knees, as well as both shins and ankles holding them.
Whenever any part of the body has a length corresponding to four digits (which would be roughly equivalent to two hands or feet), and when the groin extends as much as another digit, it is indicative of an imbalance in bodily humors.
Return (or fix) the hump on the patient'thy chest and make sure it is in its place; the length of his body from Earth corresponds to two braces.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Appoint a strong youth that will reduce the head of the thigh, and have another young man suspended above it; let another boy also lower the hip back into strength, whereby the juncture returns swiftly to its place.
In the reduction itself, when it dislocates from behind, where the hump of the sickness lies over the leg according to what we have discussed in this session; and its ligaments are placed precisely on the hollow of the illness and on the chest of him.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Each minister extends to his/her portion; and the doctor holds on with their mouth according to art.
When the dislocation occurs downwards, it is necessary to spread out that cushion and pause with one'thy hand on the sore leg joint; as stated in this medical advice, the doctor pauses his palm over the knee area of the patient suffering from a painful joint. Here we have translated each line into English:
If the dislocation is at the joints behind (the knees and ankles), it has spread out onto the ground; they have covers that are placed firmly on its cause as we described earlier for two wide areas; their face and ligaments should be extended, just like what we've said before—there will be no pain.
When compression is applied with a tablet at the location where pain occurs in the joint,
So when the reduction is complete as instructed, and you should not feel pain in your leg (the term for "reduction" may vary), extend cushions under their thighs; once again apply these same devices to loosen up tightness and expand slack spaces. Then adjust hinges and pauses between the knee joint parts so that there is no swelling on any of those sections, fasten a bandage firmly in place for three or four days.
Return the ligaments and bandaging back into place, comparing one cushion with another.
And if you see those lumps in the abdomen, you understand that the detachment has already been fixed, and thus make the humors move outwards.
If you see any cause for softening, then return and apply that bandage according to your first treatment technique, and leave it on for three days.
And bring that back into place, and make it walk on these crutches for as many days until comfortable.
Given that this text is written in an archaic form of Latin with
In translating "Curacio de dislocacio del denolh," we are dealing with a phrase from medieval or old Italian
The phrase "Le denolh es dislocat segon tres manieyras," when translated into English line by line from this old Italian context, would read:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: The sign of dislocation that you command is for the humerus (shoulder bone) to apply its cushion at the thigh joint; be aware, it has been dislocated.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When it is about restoring his position in which he lies, that part of the cushion presses against the thigh at its elevation without exerting laborious effort.
Here applies the plaster to that and fixes it on the couch at the thighs, applying those for three or four days, fixing them all together.
And do not use the humoral fluid for walking on painful days until it has healed and provided comfort.
If your reduction of it allows you to be excused, then apply force externally on the ligaments which were described in its previous treatment for the hip joint'thy healing process.
The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
Regarding the treatment of tarsal dislocation.
The heel occasionally becomes swoldoned due to slight motion, and sometimes it is dislocated either at the joints of fingers or feet.
The translation of the medieval medical treatise line by line into English is as follows:
May healing of his recovery be through gentleness and ease, and it is that which is extended to make things more comfortable and has the hand inside while returning.
When in the treatment when it is dislocated according to complementary position, make sure you stretch the thigh correctly and hold that servant firmly with your hand behind the back of what' extraneous there at this spot on its joint where they will grasp their hands for support during recovery.
Return yourself to the position of your belly button down to the lower part of the leg closest to the pubic bone area and place your left hand in that section within the hollow wherein lies its space (belly).
Return the leg to your left arm for three steps, and then move it to the left hand twice more, pressing on the chest with the right hand as you do so.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Employs the firmness of the foot to place it in position comfortably, and you are at the cradle/cavity (implied context).
So if he returns in a period of rest or two following this treatment and his foot is also swolthy (engular), then all is well; but if not, continue the operation again until that return occurs.
May you be prohibited from reducing (the condition), and the ailment will complain between your thighs on top of earth, with an immovable bed placed there; furthermore, wrap him/her in cloth so that he does not expose his illness.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: The minister of lie holds their thighs together, and another minister extends his/her leg up or over the collarbone above it; he/she also stretthy elongates each limb against its own stretching so that the body is not pulled apart from joint dislocation.
When the doctor extracts dislocation at their hands (patient' extrication), and another servant holds the healthy hip joint together until it returns to its place (the repositioning of the dislocated hip).
When the dislocation is returned and it's declared to you that there has been reduction of him/her, then apply strong compression bandage on that area immediately, and bind the foot limb to the cushion firmly.
When you fear or protect the tendons behind which are on top of the foot, to prevent them from being violent and leading that strength downwards.
After applying it for two or three days, and if the ligament becomes soothed, extend that as well.
Return that part of it either during day or at night for forty days and prevent the melancholy humors from entering the intestines. If you go ahead into that space without caution, it is not certain that the dislocation will not be loose and corrupted on its way, nor receive any treatment care.
If you apply poultice to it (the wound), then proceed as follows in the place where we describe this healing process herein mentioned above for treatment and bandaging; while ensuring that it is sufficiently moistened therewith, within these locations of care and dressing.

From the fragment "Capitol .xxxiiii.", I can infer that this might be referring to a specific section or chapter within another text,
Translating the provided fragment: When that which is dislocated should be gently moved back into place (suggestion of traction), and if it's not too difficult to do so without undue force ("abanzi"), then proceed with caution or attempt realignment. This translation attempts to preserve both meaning and stylistic elements reminiscent of the original language context, which may have drawn from various linguistic trad
If the dislocation occurs in either knee joint of the leg, take measures to lift up (or provide support) both hips and apply pressure as if holding them on a table or any stable surface; keep it so they feel steady like when initially supporting their body weight was taken. This translation reflects an attempt at understanding medieval medical practices for addressing dislocations while translating the language nuances present in such ancient texts into modern English, maintaining fidelity to potential original terminologies and procedural descriptions found within that specific context of care as depicted by means akin to "engual" or
Rest the body part that is affected by placing it in position and pause to allow for time at these joints (where you’ve aligned them), then apply calcite beneath where pressure was applied on the area; watch until returning what already has been placed there, ensuring no further protrusion appears. This translation seeks accuracy while attempting to replicate medieval medical instructional style concerning setting a dislocated limb and monitoring for complications or success of intervention as indicated by movements at joints after rest periods. Here I've maintained an effort towards the original structure suggesting body handling techniques, emphasizing positioning ("engualha") alongside preventive measures against potential issues during recovery phases in medieval medical practice contextually presented to
Return the stomach of his body into its cavity, and apply pressure to that area with two caps (presumably for compression), ensuring it is tightly secured firmly for three days; then allow rest from walking for a certain number of days until healed completely, at which point replenishment can be assured.
Given that "Capitol" does not provide any context or text related

When you address any cause of it and engage in its cure or restoration, success is assuredly leading to life' extrication from death.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And now you must urgently perform the reduction in the cause'thy cavity to prevent further development of osteomyelitis (an infected bone condition). Thus acting quickly is essential for curing this painful ailment.
And when the limb returns as we administer it, then apply the regimen that causes cautery and heals what is required from us for its lubrication of greasy ointments applied to dry liniments removed by doctors.
If dislocation is a fracture and you feel pain in the separated bones, then perform the setting of those bones properly, as previously mentioned for simple fluids encountered at these locations in their bodies.
Guard and avoid as your will directs that part of the body within which fear enters according to what preceded my preaching; for this is better from you towards your Creator, perhaps forever in honor toward him, and also health for all things here below during these times.
