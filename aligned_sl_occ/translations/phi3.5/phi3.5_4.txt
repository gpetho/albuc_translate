Oh children, you have completed this book, which is on the edge of medical science due to its contribution and because it includes excerpts from my work within your treatise; hence I perceive that you are thorough in addressing the subject matter pertaining to surgery herein.
This operation in our realm and time is entirely private, within which I have observed the science of my work with keen interest; yet there are only brief descriptions found within ancient texts that I am rectifying herein—clarifications to address errors while expanding upon these thoughts expressed by myself. Hereby lengthening arguments (or thought processes) and artistry as needed for deeper understanding, all amidst the privacy of my own work's contextual framework which was not disrupted but rather honed through selective citations from ancient works with further modifications to reflect current knowledge or intentions accurately in this discussion.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And I have seen that you understand this treatise in accordance with its second path of exposure and declaration and abbreviation; so it is necessary for me to prepare these tools used by cautery and other instruments required for their addition, as well as preparation.
May be the reason why no one dares to take away our tool in this time, for medicine is long and it requires that its practitioner exercise caution within the science of anatomy which knows Gualia inside where she understands the functions and forms of those members; as well as their connection and separation, including bones, nerves, and ligaments—and names thereof along with places in body's system for blood circulation (pulsating veins) and resting organs.
Through Aqua Ypocrates who knows by name and nature, may in the work be little, but mainly in the art of touch.
May we already have told you about that in the entrance of this book; whoever does not know what has been said to them herein will fall into error, and thus death befalls men, even if they've seen some aspects of it, as these are fashioned within this science and taken from its knowledge.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When a doctor of foliage and experience pierced a scrophilous ulcer on a woman' extramandibular region, he also penetrated some arteries in that area so that much blood could flow inside which caused her death between its parts.
Here comes another doctor who orders the patient to drink a stone of wine that had been processed in his body, and this stone was large, came down into him through one of the bladder's tubes, leading ultimately for that bodily substance (the stone) to cause the death of the man on the third day.
And you have already called for it to be removed there, and because of the greatness of the stone and due to its position in the uterus where it will surely die (be extracted).
And another doctor takes the fee from our duke of this land to perform surgery, and brings with him one who is very black because he has broken his thigh; and due to ignorance, he dislocates the fracture on the ground using strong straight tools like pillows and bedposts, without letting air escape.
Here he applies the dressing according to their wishes, and secures it with bandage and order that we untie the ligament; here they stay until the thigh enters into rupture.
And you have called upon him/her, and provided apparatus to remove the ligament, thus achieving peace and easing of your pains.
Even if there is corruption in the limb, it cannot be restrained and will not stop roaming within when the malady prospers inside.
And another doctor pierces an abscess and it ulcerates daily within which the cunning of him grows day by day towards his lordship.
The cause is that the skull must be treated for yellow bile from all over, not just in one member where it has been housed.
And for these reasons, it is necessary that the operation be arranged in two parts: one associated with health and healing at this place (here), and another concerned with dangerous procedures or major decisions to address potential complications elsewhere.
And you have brought water into this free place where encounter and fear occur; therefore it is necessary for you to keep the water safe and set that aside, so that leaves do not wither away and deceit does not affect you.
Therefore take up your arms in solicitation and for the protection of God, and let your illness be healed and firmly fixed.
When you have taken the better way for God's grace and hope in salvation and praiseworthy succession, take hold of your fearful conditions that require difficult healing, so that through faith and your name they do not frighten or cause escape: perhaps there may remain to your glory; place some atop you as on a pillow, others upon your legs like servants.
When gout strikes some members of its course: There is no physician for illnesses that doctors cannot name.
And you have already read this free text for the second time three chapters.
Begins the division of free space, and first in the primary partition. The ordered first chapter within the feet, in terms of instruments and iron tools for caulters, what is necessary therein.
The division of the second partition. The second chapter on cauterization and perforation, as well as pills, poultices, extraction of herbs and similes to these things; all this has been ordered in the forms of instruments.
The third part of restoration and detachment, and for the healing and easing backward bending dislocations to these; ordered within the head in weighty matters, and concerning shapes/forms of instruments used by them.
When you examine the quality of that cauterization and its contents, and in which it is forbidden to perform further cauterizations.
Thus it is said that the discourse of cautery and its nature are long and complex, subtle by science, with hidden motives; they speak much about their qualities, yet disagree among themselves, which is enough for me to understand (it seems like there'se a depth I need to grasp).
And it is said that the pointed cautery comforts throughout the entire body universally, except for two types of materials belonging to its own matter, namely tail ends.
In the complex tail and dry matter are separated; there those who use needles find it beneficial for that area, while others apply what is contrary to it, which is not suitable in illness characterized by both moisture and dryness—since nature of fever consists of such elements (moisture and dryness), appropriate treatment involves the separation and management of water contained within these areas.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "Discipline that speaks against it, which by means of cautery is greatly used in all dry and arising maladies on men'se feet where they come together with his humors at the focus," when comparing a man’s body parts (feet) and their respective fluids to understand how these can negatively affect one another.
Through the speech of that person, I have already experienced some relief myself.
Even if you need to withdraw the tool used for cauterization that has already been exposed and exercised in the capital of treatments during previous sessions, understand this diversity within human complexity and disease disposition in their bodies, as well as the causes of those conditions and accidents, along with the time span of these occurrences.
May also occur in other complexities, not out of fear but mainly due to cold and wet humors that affect all these areas; moreover, doctors are agreed upon addressing such issues with caution when performing cautery here.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May the medicine burn reach that in their limbs which they have neglected and hardened, causing great difficulty for healing and leading to significant pain.
May the focus (or point), due to its sublimity and good substance, does not cause more than what is necessary E even now we are known by experiments and long study of service in this art concerning truth about causes; hence it excuses from lengthy discourse A for those who have yet come secretly seeking help at the hip joint (the focus), I will provide relief here without delay, demonstrating through my work on limbs and their expulsion as a means to remove illnesses. This philosophical argument proves useful in your knees.
And wise men know that it is best for performing cautions and pauses with the most suitable times at the beginning of pregnancy.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And that it is convenient in all times for a cautery (treatment) drawn from this water so that harm due to time accrues under its application, especially if used for pains or necessary instruments such as needles and hooks which do not delay their use because of the fear they may bring upon those who treat them.
So you don'thy not press upon your feet or thighs; for they do not estimate the humors but common folk and physicians who believe that healing by cautery is not complete until a pause has followed it as consequence.
The cause is not due to lack of sleep where the legs are concerned; rather, cautery (treatment) should only be applied in a medical place that changes complexity and dries out the humidities which are causing the pain.
May, therefore, pointed cautery be used excessively in medicine due to the patient' extrinsic value and operative effort of their lordship.
It is possible that the illness may return at some time in its course due to the complexity of the disease and its location within the body; moreover, if cautery has been applied on the patient's limbs for excess superfluity and moisture - these causes - then it is also a subtle malady affecting small amounts of surplus and wetness. However, should this medicine be administered in pills as well, there may no longer return that pain to him/her here; rather, the discomfort might arise at their throat instead (possibly referring to related symptoms).
Even though it is vulgar speech that the instruments of medicine are used for repositioning and straightening (the actual practice), here they do not understand or comprehend what I, as a healer practicing in this field or elsewhere with these tools, truly seek to cure.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And for the old ones that are made of gold and their substance is elevated, they do not use iron but rather those crafted from gold as cautery instruments because it'thy luster equals to its strength (and quality).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Through this water, we apply pointed iron tools and place them appropriately in the operation area.
And you have ordered this in the area of caution as well as within their feet, ensuring that whoever asks for it will receive from them.
The First Point/Chapter (assuming "Le Capitol
The First Point/Chapter: Here it discusses the application of cauterization to address moisture and coldness from an accident causing these issues; attributed as a cause involving gas or excessive airflow, affecting limbs (legs) downwards towards joints, due to prolonged sleep. It also addresses dental pain and gout resulting from this condition universally. Additionally, the chapter covers numbness associated with paralysis, hardening of flesh causing pains resembling apoplexy or stroke-like symptoms in these ailments.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the malady to be evacuated through medicinal leeches for three or four nights, according to how much urges it and the patient'se age and habitus.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When you press your palm' extrication pressure on top of your foot over the bridge between their nostrils, here is what happens: But when the heat from below reaches that place where it has come down to, signs indicate an attempt there at balance; apply fire (likely referring to hot oil or similar treatment) on this instrument of which this is a form.
And place it over the location where pressure is applied; this action of tightening gradually occurs at that point, and you should turn or rotate it thereafter.
Return your hand to the wound area and observe it; if you find any bone exposed from the skull, raise your hand as much as there is growth of pus (or infection), likewise with how much grief (infection) exists, return your hand over that extent. If your hand becomes cold, look inside to see what has been said about this issue previously by you.
Return some salt and dissolve it over the location, letting it stay there for three days.
Return your hand over his chest where it has begun, and place that there above which the shield of the focus (or fire) is shattered/destroyed. Return care for the area where there is a quadruple-composed drug within that which should heal it.
And when a patient has urinated in bed, as much honey is taken and poured into the bra (the catheter), so that it may be better and more beneficial for them.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: E disserent ali quiea sagaça l'oca dentro dret el oz, i se tenuts li cautionis intre com alguna parte tractada en l'os.

Beyond the healing touch of cupping therapy that reaches into your bone with force before it retreats back inside where the bone absorbs this treatment, here lies a small act of apotheosis. (This line translates to saying beyond just using suction for therapeutic purposes in cupping—which enters and exits within strong muscular boundaries while being taken up by the skeleton itself) is an almost mystical or perfected form of healing, often referred to as alphecati petit From this location exhale breaths from the head. (This line implies that after applying cupping therapy at a specific point on or near the body, one might notice an out

I have not seen these various types of cupping therapy tools; but among those who practice them as a form of fear—and you must understand this better for my health's sake—especially when the head is raised by lighting, and primarily at nighttime following our observation in other parts of the body. (This line suggests that while not familiar with different cupping tools used out of caution or superstition ("fear"), it becomes apparent their value lies for one’s well-berem—when performed under specific conditions such as using light to elevate a head, and mostly at nighttime based on experiences observed in other body parts). Here the user is noting that cupping seems particularly relevant when applied to areas of concern like those near or related to bone structures ("malaute") during times associated with natural rhythms—likely referring to darkness (night) as a time for healing. The term "solucio de continuitat" can be interpreted herein
The translation of each line into English is as follows:
Second Section/Chapter (assuming 'Capitol' refers
From the head or scalp wound, apply a pointed instrument for treatment (
When the wound on the head or scalp is chronic and long-lasting due to an extended malady within it, use knives and lances as well as scrapers and cauldrons (potentially for boiling medicinal substances), along with purgatives and clogs, spikes, chains, nails, linens or rags. However, if the head wound is of considerable hardness in nature—implying a more robust build within that part of it—consideration must be given at once to another form of treatment; for one should not unnecessarily cause great harm (emphasizing restraint), particularly when already employing cauterization with such an instrument. Return that over the top of your head for cautery within where the intestine is divided. Cut the ribcage and expose its quantity as we have counted and sealed it with a cauterium in the area called herein for suction—this is where air has been drawn into place. And press your hand firmly, and do not open the bones, for the hump causes great pain different from that of other burns on the head.
Here you direct the cautery in its place, for when this same cautery is used on the head' extraneous parts like corn and occiput are treated with subtle cautions that belong to it herein lies our method.

The provided Latin phrases appear to be medieval medical terminology related to treatment methods for a condition, possibly gout or an abscess ("emigration of pus").
When joint pain is solid or when the toe hurts (the term "cap dolor" may refer to a foot condition), extract medicine and administer it immediately for healing; these remedies are mentioned in relation to treating diseases - do not neglect, cauterization here can be with acute combustion medication or iron.
May hot irons used in medicine burn to take a pillow (or poultice) and remove the limbs of both from these objects, which they hold onto with their hands. And impinge on the location of pain at one place where there is a sharp knife hidden within it for treatment purposes that way.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return care for that which is inside so that it may heal.
If you come, take some of these burning remedies that you have written about in the section on hot treatments for ailments.
As for this method of cautery, it involves iron and takes on the following form:
and it is called a club-like claw because the head of his body (head) takes on this shape as if holding some form of a calla flower in which there may be curvature, and smallness/petiteness can also be observed at that spot where heat accumulates.
Return the pause (rest) to the location of pain, and hold your hand there—so that the razor does not come close again where it was used today—and slowly turn over the small blade by turns according to speed.
If the amount of liquor that is absorbed through the anal canal increases to such a degree where your hand must be used to prevent it from being absorbed further (thus avoiding excess flow downwards), here comes what you need:

The phrase "cauzare la emigrana antica" seems to refer to a medical practice from ancient times related to treating hemorrhage
When treating hemorrhage as mentioned in the ancient texts about healing, and according to their division of illnesses—wherein if not properly treated with the aforementioned cauterizing liquids used by medicine or fire-based treatments for fractures (which you are referring to), whereby sometimes these methods alone may be insupective due to the severity, here is what this translates into stepwise:
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuous jaw movement as your mouth chomps (chews), and that your temporalis muscle not become tired or strain those nerves which cause such discomfort; so they don't worsen.
If it is about the guardianship and caution of blood flow from where artery begins, there'dicted fear within them who know not what causes this and do no study nor investigate; therefore perform the operation on him with their best effort.
When they come for recall of the royal army'se regimen of fluid accidents according to their customary practice in this place.
If you see from this illness that the current treatment is not sufficient for the inflamed area of the womb and comes to our head as we have described, then treat that part with cauterization here at the location in the navel where it has healed previously, and care for the patient inside until they are restored.
If you go now, administer the one we have just mentioned in our discussion about hot iron cautery and doing so is even better treatment for these two cuts on cloth bandages (cotels).
The text provided appears to be an attempt at translating medieval medical termin

When there is pain in the ear due to cold and harmful causes which this text speaks of, they discuss another form of treatment that I have mentioned earlier. If not alleviated by fire (or heat), then it applies a cauterization with points on its surface—this describes herein what has been previously specified as puncture for the purpose at hand:
Here comes the first sentence to translate: E apply points herewith and carry it through all parts of the body using a heated instrument, or along any course where pain is present in some part. Long ago you have used the lancet of silver, thin and sharp as your skin to try this place that tempted you.
If all points on the patient' extrices (body), and where necessary take care of those places that are healed.
Capitolo VI. (The sixth chapter.)
Of cauterization of joint pain.
Cure and for cauterization come only from spices that enter through the veins, as we have mentioned in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid using specialized caustic for such dryness or nerve spasm.
When you heal that specific type of bleeding and pus formation without discomfort in your treatment, make sure to use the following three cauteries: take a gold needle for the ulcer, apply small movements with its temple (touchstone), and employ your lips' union as touch.
And apply pressure with the hot cautery for contrary parts of the diseased area, where relief may be felt only in the healthy portion that appears to recover.
The form of cauterization is that you apply the cautery directly on the tip of the finger belonging to the patient' extralong toe, and in the temple region; another part as long as it corresponds with the length of said foot, where your hand acts as a caution within which combustion occurs for burning off the quantity necessary from the incision made at the knee joint.
This is how the cautery should be made, and it's specific for barber surgeons; this form I present now. May there be subtly put under that which has scarcely been seen, and for the excess of unnecessary swelling a little one.
With care for the place where that which is now proceeding inside will be healed,
Given that "Capitol" does not provide any textual content for
From the fragment provided, it appears you're referring to an ancient method of treating apoplexy (commonly understood as a stroke in modern
When apoplexy is an ancient condition and the remedies we have today are not suitable—especially if your physician or surgeon does not currently possess a fever (which could indicate infectious processes) — then you may use these four types of cautery: over all parts of their head, including both foreheads; in places where they sweat, such as under the armpits and around the navel/umbilicus; on body cavities like those for breathing or digestion. The action of the pointed cautery is said according to what has been mentioned beforehand.
And it has been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach, and perhaps more will heal as time goes by; place your care where you proceed with its treatment.

The translation for this line is: "Reduce the head of the malady and place your hand on it, as described in the treatise regarding applications." Here they are likely referring to a hands-on treatment method where direct contact or application by touch ("place your hand") with some part (the top/head) of something related to an illness is mentioned. The specifics "coguot de lu
The translation for this line would be: "Pause a few days, and then it is the custom of using caustics." This indicates that after an initial treatment phase ("a few days"), there might follow or coincide with another traditional approach involving The translation here would be: "After such a measure already mentioned." This implies that the text is continuing to describe procedures following an earlier discussion of similar measures, possibly related to treatment methods for joint pain using
The translation for this line is: "So if these healing boons exist; otherwise, apply three cauterizations in the upper region of your head, which are within the area above where the forehead begins (near to the top part)." Here they describe a possible treatment involving burning or caulking with medicinal substances ("healing boons"), targeted at specific areas on someone'thy skull if previous remedies have not been effective. The phrasing reflects typical medieval medical prescriptions where treatments were localized and had to be applied by hands, as indicated by the use of "es" (you). And there is space between each cautery of this body part, and pay special care for the water that proceeds from it.
If you increase and the thigh is tolerating it well, then apply cautery at the warm place on the skin; but if there's more swelling, cauterize that over both toes.
Apply that which is healed within it; and if cautery ointments are given, apply them according to how they have been presented by the giver.
Given that "Capitol" likely refers to an ancient Roman
Cauterization of worms and palliation for all parts of the body.
When you process in the mindfulness of the head and what have we discussed; and return your attention to the back of the neck, where apply that which is used for cautery there at its heat spot on the head, and also over all heads' corns, as well as above their waist line, applying three times upon each spinal disc.
If it is necessary in the plague of softening for that part of the body and if this disease persists or worsens (malady), then apply four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and insert them into the area between your fingers as directed by its head (the doctor's instruction).

Thus, we must clarify the brain at rest and during other forms of treatment as specified in this division when excess humors are present and when exceptions occur outside traditional medicine approaches: In this statement from a medieval medical text translated into English, it suggests that there is an emphasis on understanding or "clarifying" what happens within the patient's mind (the brain) at different times—specifically during rest ("at comensament") as well as under various treatment conditions. It further points out when excess humors are evident and traditional medicinal practices might not be sufficient to address these exceptions, indicating a time or situation where standard procedures may
If it is an infant who does not respond to the medicines administered by servants (or attendants), then apply ointments and poultices using motion through days as directed in the prescriptions for foods: Here, a medieval medical practitioner advises on alternative care methods when conventional medicine fails—specifically recommending therapeutic applications of greasy substances or salves applied over time to an infant who is not responding well. The treatments are described as being carried out daily and following dietary guidance for foods, which would have
Return the hump of the hernia to its cavity and apply a heated lancet there at night when symptoms occur as instructed previously for each part on top: This directive involves returning any abnormal bulge (hump) associated with an inguinal or other type of hernia back into place. The physician prescribes the use of heat in specific locations—likely where discomfort is reported, often at nighttime as described previously by their treatments for each area on top: It's a practice derived from medieval medicine that involves cauterization (using heat) to manage pain or other symptoms linked with hernias. The treatment would be applied If the uterus is strong and able to endure it, then apply that cauterization therapy which I have described, causing immobilization and softening of the body over the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae.
And if it is necessary for the olive-like pointed instrument (cauter), as previously mentioned, then proceed with its use according to what has been stated earlier in
And if the patient is a child, pause and apply the pointed instrument with subtlety according to this methodology (treatment approach).

When the causes of melancholy are rotten and moist (possibly referring to 'foul humors' in excess), they can be treated with these very cautery instruments designed for relieving spasms or paralysis within the body. Here, "cauterize" is used metapsychologically rather than physically—the idea might stem from a belief that applying heat could somehow 'purify' or restore balance to one’thy bodily humors (an ancient medical theory).
If the cause of melancholy is excessive and declines in the head (indicating a worsening state or imbalance), then the limbs are humid, let them drink what purifies their brain as they drank before division.

When translating the given Latin-influenced medical text, it appears that we are dealing with a medieval understanding of medicine which often combined elements from different traditions and languages:
When you declare the condition of water in the foot through which veins flow and determine that it is a division where fluid accumulates (likely referring to edema or swelling), at this point begins your treatment with warm, medicinal liquid poured into the affected area—this helps purify what comes out from below by keeping everything moist.
When that sweetness enters through water for these days (implying a treatment with honey and water over certain periods), it suggests using this remedy regularly as part of the healing regimen during those specific
Commands Lu to apply pressure on the head and cauterize that area with a pointed forceps at the spot of heat in the head; also commands the application of two cauterisms over two tables if there is consumption (likely referring to dysentery) of water or wine from two vessels, or one lancet if it's about consuming pure water from just one vessel.
Here's the line-by extraline translation:
Guard your throat when it is being cauterized; and if you feel the flow of blood at that time, apply some medicine to it, which may be within your means.

The phrase "de cauterizacio de lacrimas antiquas" translates to English as the caulization of ancient tears,
When ancient tears are accumulated significantly and detected through the veins and arteries where they manifest in deficient capillaries of the eyes (the head' extrinsic venous system), caulization is applied to what was previously recorded as water cures within these areas, including at the temple region near the eye on both sides. Moreover: If there are ingestions of excess, then burn that part over the entirety of the colon above its junction with the small intestine using a small caustic instrument.

When you treat that person who has spoken about their division and not properly received your medicine, then apply these cups to the nose for three nights; place them on top of his head (head), which is where we will perform our treatment with these cauterizing tools designed specifically for this purpose. Here "cauterizes" refers to a form of medical intervention aimed at curing or alleviating an illness, possibly related to the nose and sinuses due to its reference in treating foul breath (as suggested by “fetor de nas”). The text implies that if this treatment is not provided adeaully as required ("no aprofieyta la tua medicacio"), additional measures—likely involving some form of heat or pressure therapy using cups, referred to here colloquially and possibly indicative of ancient Therefore apply that tool for cauterization to the scalp where two lashes of hair are positioned above, and place just one more on top of these locations (the eyelashes), with which you will perform this specific form of cauterization treatment.

If the figure of the cautery follows this form (implied to be circular), and if desired, perform a large cauterization in the stomach area according to this shape; it is thus a ring-shaped cautere as per this method. Here, an emphasis on precision for targeted treatment appears evident—a technique perhaps aiming at specific areas within the body through carefully designed instruments like these circle or ring-shaped cauteries used in medical practice of that era to deliver heat therapy effectively and selectively during procedures such as surgery (cauterization) with potentially significant implications for healing outcomes.
If you have already pierced the stomach with this particular type of (circular) cautery, and it frightens you: that is where your handpiercing will be according to how much you wish to attempt; accordingly apply further puncturing in those spots using another set of points on a second pair of heated needles. Carefully proceed with this additional piercing so long as the previous curative action remains effective within, ensuring continued treatment and potential for recovery or resolution (in line with medieval medical practices where continuous assessment was likely required post-intervention). Here there is an acknowledgment that further interventions—such as repetitive puncturing using cautery tools after initial heating application in the stomach area, could be applied under specific conditions to enhance curative efforts. The practice suggests a form of gradualism or stepwise treatment approach whereby subsequent therapeutic actions

This is how one uses cautery when pain is attached to the joint and does not extend into the groin area.

From the treatment of gout and joint pain:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And when gout healing is due from the manipulation and not to be forgotten about further pain reliefs, then apply bandages with care.
When you are cauterizing that which is expulsion within the limb' extrication channel, using our respective burners (cauterization).
And this is the form of that pointed cautery:
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for this purpose. If the pains penetrate into the anuses or other joints, and motions occur therein, it is necessary to apply caustic here for each of those painful parts with three or four applications using this caustic.
If you have the necessary cautery tools at hand, then apply them to that area without pressing too hard with your hands; do so solely by moving the instrument from undernethy's tongue.
If pain enters into both knees, then administer the treatment we have mentioned in our chapter.
If the pains are only in the legs, and it is called suppuration, then a point must be made along the course of the channels as they turn, on those two lines.
If there are residual pains in the joints, then make a puncture on the circumference of each articulation and over every bone marking its location where your finger presses down (palpates).
If joint or muscle pain comes upon certain days with the legs or backbone, then burn all parts of their helpers (probably referring to a healing practice where heat is applied).
If the bowels are not properly cleansed and receive adegyne (a term used to refer to medicine or treatment), even if a good regimen is followed with this instrument for purification, God will help.

So if you intend to cauterize it (referring presumably to an infected area), consider whether the leprosy is caused by putrefaction and these waters that we have previously discussed for curing; neither of which should be left out, nor this one. Be mindful about decay potentially affecting all parts of the body including head hair – thus apply here: above the head (on top) to where cauterization has been mentioned earlier in relation thereto and immediately afterward atop each limb joint; on both shoulders as well if corn-like growths are present, behind either neck or skin flap. Apply caustic substances not just for external but also internal treatment: above the head hair line where it meets forehead flesh (the temple area), then immediately over front and back of each limb joint; on both shoulders as well if there's a corn-like growth present, behind either neck or skin flap. The passage outlines detailed instructions for applying cauterization specifically targeting areas around the head hairline where leprosy could manifest in decayed body parts and emphasizes thorough application of treatment to these critical zones.

In some cases caustic is applied to any numbness within the body or feet and down into the vertebrae of the spine where nerves are located; such application helps relieve the sensation of paralysis (numbness/paresthesia). This indicates that cauterization may be used for specific areas related to neural function when treating conditions like numbness, suggesting its role in restoring or alleviating neurological symptoms.

Therefore if you find that caustic (corrosive) agents are present in the area where treatment was applied with a small flame or cauterizing heat source, then apply larger burns selectively and as necessary to counteract the effect of these corroding substances.

Allow three days for the burn treatment applied on those parts, and pause over these treated locations until there are no remaining scars from burning or complete removal of all decay (corrosion), ensuring that nothing remains which could cause further deterioration similar to how rust must be fully addressed before it can spread unchecked.

Then remove that small amount of water; after waiting for just an hour from when you applied pressure with the needle, take it out again—this is done if there's a slight bite due to fluid coming through these parts during urination: atrophy (or shrinkage) will occur in this residual volume by removing and reapplying water several times.

When the operation in that case is where moisture (humidity) is between the chin and bone, and the abscess is small, then cut it open at the place of pain on the upper jaw as a fissure forms there; this is how the sprain occurs:
And if there is an increase in moisture and the ulceration becomes more severe, here are two cracks according to this mannerism.

The reference also implies an intimate knowledge of the body’ couture, where linen's tightness might symbolize or represent applied force to stimulate flow and thus balance humors according to ancient medical theories which believed in four essential 'humorous' substances within one's constitution that must be kept balanced.

If while working you encounter an outflow of sick blood from the artery during labor, then at that moment tighten or apply said bleeding vessel (artery), and strengthen your grip to restrict that flow of blood. If any cause of those is not present with you now, then rest your hand on the place where the sore has congealed, and apply pressure at that spot until it cools down due to strong frigidity within which its inflammation subsides, doing so as per their strength.
When the leech is placed outside of the artery, you are performing a bloodletting procedure with two lances that have been handled by yourself; after each withdrawal (usually done for an ignited cause), wait until they reach the bones and separate them into two places so that it extends to where your limbs meet – thus these areas will not heal completely through this treatment.

When these joint pains are sharp and acidic (perhaps referring to intense inflammation or an acute condition), they affect the veins underne d your head's temples ("test del cap deforo"), where no external cause is tolerated for healing, making it necessary: at times, even a patient suffering from these pains will appear as though their face involuntarily drags along with them in ambulation—mimicking the scurry of ants; simultaneously, this state exhausts the limbs so much that they feel like wet fur and one's nails become chalky due to perspiration ("humitz enayssi"). The ancient healing masters (indicated by "antics agro mesties") employ various techniques within these treatments, ensuring a comprehensive approach. This highlights not only the physical aspects of medieval medical practices but also underscdict how patients' symptoms and experiences were deeply interconnected with their overall health management in those times. The term “nompnero” here suggests that this multifaceted treatment contributes to or ensures recovery, emphasizing a holistic approach where even the psychological state ("se involuntariamente draga la face") is considered important for healing. This passage provides insight into how medieval medicine regarded symptoms and their impact on patients' daily lives while also showcasing specialized interventions used by health practitioners of that era to address complex conditions like joint pains characterized as being “sharp” or "acidic.
When you command the malady to pull back its hairs that are on its face, and position your finger in three incision points along the mouth according to the length of the forehead. If the length of the fissure extends two lengths: one distance from the nose in the forehead'se location where tears are formed, and another corresponding to a small movement of the eyes which belong there; then this third portion belongs elsewhere.

From the care of pictures for catharsis and the healing powers derived from those drawn by the head, which can be interpreted as a belief in therapeutic images or talismans created under guidance that could purify emotions (cathartic effect) and
When the patient undergoes catharsis and continues doing so, at times even their humors are exhausted by these healing images (talismans or therapy derived from head drawings), leading to a necessity for care of those aspects; when it comes time also for attending them—the eyes ulcerated and the scalp hairs falling out. Herein lies an acute pain in their chest, exacerbating as these materials (healing images or talismans) are not from natural sources but rather stemming directly from veins of parts drawn by the head's hand—which implies that genuine insight and understanding emerge only when realizing this point.
And the best cure for these is: that you command the malady to raise its own front, and apply a small incision at the spot on the forehead where it appears, which will be inside one temple using the left hand (and insertion in the ridge of the right temple; inserted into bone), until the bone becomes visible.
Remove all the sanctity of sponge or dry cloth that is placed between the upper and lower lips of the small opening at the collar bone, respectively. Returning up above on the pulse in vein and oil, ensuring it does not develop into an abscess (carbuncle).

Since that which occurs in the fingers/thumbs is one of four kinds, whether it's metal or resembles metal (like iron and wool), or because it is like plant matter such as beans or lentils, or if its cause stems from fluidity akin to water along with mercury and their semblances—or perhaps due to some animal factor:
And when blood flows in the earlobe or seems similar to those causes that do not fit into it and stop the flow of blood from the earlobes there, if you see such bleeding coming out of any cause (possibly injury or inflammation), then administer its removal, perform stitching as needed for proper healing.

When extracting the evil generated in the artery during healing and you do not comfort your treatment of that extracted water previously discussed in division and fluid movement processes, then watch over the vein towards the sunlight.
So then if there is any cause of worms here, extract that with gentle hands or small subtle movements; otherwise take a catheter quickly prepared and inserted below this area – it's the form we use for treatment. And insert the delicate extremity into the artery according to the quantity that suffering may cause in it; and draw out syrup from there strongly, letting flowing movements continue until all worms are expelled through their holes (holes).

The procedure for treatment in this text involves taking a needle that creates double threading and keeping it fixed within the body's flesh; as the string passes from one tear (lacrimal) gland on the right side into another, reaching eventually to both ends of your limbs. This description implies an attempt at drainage or extraction based on a rudimentary understanding consistent with medieval medical practices for addressing certain conditions potentially related to eye blockages described by 'vertaderment'. It should be noted that this interpretation requires significant extrapolation and historical context, given the archaic language used.
The procedure further entails stretching or extending the flesh away from where there is an attached needle and with that same needle in hand; you would then insert it into a large numa (cushion). This suggests using local pressure to facilitate some form of medical intervention, perhaps as part of draining fluids associated with 'vertaderment', according to the practices So if you return the shape of the eyelid as it was before (cover), be; and if not, take a stick and pause on the fractured part, turning that fragment back into the eyelid'dictum, and fix those cracks in the lid's flesh immediately.

Capitol .xix.: This line appears incomplete or out of context without
The phrase "de reduccio de arizati al nas" seems to be in Latin, which translates roughly
When you care for arising inflammations that are acute and have not been described as such in the narrative, they do not occur within your body but rather on a suppuration site; moreover, extract all moisture where it's lodged inside until discovery of bone is made. This translation attempts to capture the essence of what seems like medical instructions or observations from an old text relating to treatment procedures for certain conditions:
And when you discover bone and at times in its decay or ruin, it is then that this form of structure takes shape.
And it is made of sharp nails, and its flesh consists of iron or silver, with which points are pierced for a delicate touch (as you will follow in this manner).
When the pressure is applied to that spot where the bone has been crushed, turn it back between the thighs and gradually press your finger inside until you know that this crushing damage has been smoothed out.
When there are some remedies needed, and restore the place affected by drying or puncture causes.
So that the place is consolidated and good flesh has arisen therein from illness and disease for forty days without renewal or puncturing and without accidents occurring in it, if you know this, then one is healed.

When the hump is present in its entirety and does not harm or diminish within the vesture; at that time, cover it loosely with moistened malaute (which implies a poultice), followed by gentle venting of coughs on one'thy chest after scarification for good effect. Also apply pause over the hump using liniment made from acacia and aloe, seeds or plant ashes (essentially an emollient mixture applied to soothe skin inflammation often found in medieval medicine), along with powdered seaweed known here as sarcocolla—a binding agent derived traditionally from marine shells. Additionally apply strength through the use of a poultice over the hump when it protrudes (likely referring to exactional swelling).
The following is the line-by extralinguistic translation:

It seems this line discusses gout or rheumatism—a type of joint pain associated with uric acid crystallization within
Translation: It is the manner of action that causes uric acid to crystallize and deposit on a device (possibly an instrument used for observation or diagnosis), with your hand placed over those parts where discomfort arises, aiming to dry them out so they do not worsen. Additionally, this prevents further detachment of the humors within their respective divisions upon entering as it were through yesternight'dictions (perhaps referring to symptoms or signs appearing from recent events). Herein lies where uric acid comes about—the causes intertwine with its appearance like a nocturnal tale.

When the extraction of any such cracked tooth is necessary due to no particular reason (presumably suggesting a situation where an injury or misalignment requires action), you must pause at the spot until it heals; and meanwhile apply some form of analgesic, holding aside pieces from which teeth are assembled like those in the beak of a crow or woodpecker's tongue. This refers to using forceps for extraction:
Those outside of them are pains stitched with a knife or awl.
If you do not obey me in this treatment with these forceps or tenalas (which are small pincers), then I will bite on the skin and remove all flesh using the instrument called "haft," which has a similar shape to its handle.

In treating other teeth than those which are prominent or notably affected, special care is necessary due to their increased vulnerability or potential for more severe issues related
When the teeth are prominent due to their natural shape or mainly in women and revered ones, it is clear that special consideration must be given if one of these does not correspond with another; thus rooting out what cannot cut nor bind itself because they do not share a connection—unless annexed by another such tooth.

From the context provided, it seems like we're dealing with a medieval or old-style phrase related to teeth restoration (which might imply some form of ancient or traditional dentistry). The text
When your teeth are worn down by grinding and loosening (percussio or cazament), and the tooth pulp cannot be held back with what you have managed thus far – indicating that there's an active issue, such as decay reaching into the nerve of a tooth. Your current treatment may not suffice; hence why they might suffer further in those teeth which are firmly anchored by gold (argent) or silver fillings since these metals do not change over time and can be adjusted according to need each day, whereas silver does not alter its form without external intervention – implying that the filling may shift if unchecked.

Only in certain cases are the bones of cows appropriate for their use as teeth substitutes; they must be placed where a tooth has been lost and secured with what we have treated (or fixed), holding them firmly there, much like how one would secure actual dental prostheses. They remain attached through long periods—this underscores the enduring nature of such replacements when properly executed by skilled artisans using suitable materials as guided in this passage from an old medical text on treatments for lost teeth and related oral issues, possibly reflecting practices before modern dentistry was established.

When there is infection or inflammation of the sole (golair), these are the glands that have been assembled and which darken after healing—these nail avulsions, when treated with what we've applied during division and do not heal properly, consider if it’n a durable abscess. If so, in case of black coloration or little sensitivity without fearing to touch the affected area lightly (avoid using forceful methods which might worsen pain). The passage is advising caution when handling an unresolved and possibly infected nail avulsion—especially if it has not healed properly, showing signs of infection such as dark discoloration or reduced sensitivity. It suggests gentle intervention rather than aggressive treatment for this kind of foot abscess.
If it is a request for color and the abscess has become thickened or larger, do not touch that area with force; leave it there as long as possible to allow natural healing (do no more intervention). If necessary at this point you must drain fluid from within—either by making an incision yourself if safe enough doing so. Here the directive is against further invasive measures and instead recommends allowing time for self-healing while suggesting a last resort of physical release through draining, which implies careful incisions to relieve pressure or remove pus should be performed very cautiously by someone with medical skill—if not better left untouched entirely.
If it is of white or bluish hue and its nature is subtle, then that one must recognize being inscribed within itself.

So you fed him with his mouthful by mouth and let him rest in one of their seats; then dragged that out for me to see, taking the large piece from what I understood about the other's wound. Then sealed my mouth therein, cleaned his tongue thoroughly, and secured himself back into the lumbago position where he was injured.
Return the intestine or hernia back into its cavity; it only escapes by little and small parts of itself. Therefore it is the gout of that woman, and immediately begin to drink water, then provide food so that she will not cease suffering from those humors for a long time, until the humor enters where it has been accumulated, at which point healing can commence.
So then you will drain and cauterize the gallbladder of him/her, thus removing its excessive functioning; moreover, walk around it without fear that I may interfere with your actions concerning this matter.
The text provided appears to be from an ancient medical treatise discussing remedies for
When the humidity of a room is observed as it decreases, thus allowing air circulation and potentially alleviating discomfort that might be associated
When the humidity in a room decreases and it becomes cooler or longer (possibly referring to increased air circulation), then there is no need for specific action; but if this occurs on a large, heavyset part of the body, such as an abdomen referred to here colloquially with "buba," appropriate measures should be taken.
When healed with the fluid that we have discussed in division, do not hinder your treatment, and continue to apply heat; if it extends long or is red/black in color (sanguine), which you fear for its location under the patient's abdomen, therein lies your concern.
When you time that second movement which the patient has dictated about their whiteness and length, perform these actions: separate the abdomen (maloat) with your hands as if doing so for saliva collection purposes using an instrument they provide through this process; place one cushion under them while another touches their legs or chest depending on which of two instruments is being used to make incisions, and hold their hands.
When what is not inserted therein but rather adjusted to the patient' extrinsic parts as dictated by nature, if you insert it at all may be done so gently that your speech remains unaffected.
Return (to) the inflammation, using that which we have applied within its cavity of two thighs, and take care of it where it is healed.
If the patient's abdomen is frightened by his ignorance during cauterization and their fear of the instrument used for cauterization is merely water-like, then you should pause at the top of the abdomen where your hand can rest comfortably on it. Place your tongue against the tool that we have mentioned so far in this text (the instruments), take hold of the same amount/temperature of water as used for cauterization herein described and use them with care, completing their natural cavity shape:
Such is the cavity of conquest in which medicine rests alongside a woman'se needle, and stops there with that instrument as part of healing, so that saliva or mucus from the mouth of such person does not come down into the cleft (i.e., joint) where it may cause any harm to him/her; thus protecting them from whatever damage might arise because of this fluid's entry therein.
Here you place your hand on the medicine to express it over the uvula through the spaces of an hour until that thing is blackened and numb from the bite of medicine.
If you wish, prick the cord and wrap it over the extremity of the ray (probably referring to an umbilical or other similar body part), immerse the cord in medicine, place the ray against the cord within a tube so that the cord adheres therein, infuse as much fluid into this arrangement until you have consumed what is needed for cauterization of the wound, and then apply pressure to it; allowing three days or four should suffice.
If you have indigestion and are following the medicine's course, repeat that treatment, applying cauterization within the wine cup at its beginning in bed, cleaning off any fluid from this circuit of healing, washing it with water as needed, curing completely inside an embrace, until recovery is achieved.
This healing substance was put in place and kept for a very fearful amount of time due to concern or dread.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
E once the limb is inserted into the mouth of the malady until the steam reaches the palate and the uvula becomes dimmed.
Return the intestine or hernia to its cavity and place your hand over it so that the intestine does not protrude again; do this carefully lest you interfere with the healing of an inguinal (groin) hernia, which would otherwise become worse.
May it not be that you do not have this instrument with you? Then take a can and make in the external cavity of yourself an enclosure of smoke, so that the mouth of the malady is warmed, for the smoke from within the hollow prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
This treatment is good for health.
Given that this text is written in an archaic form of language with influences
From the removal of thorns and water stuck to the foot, along with other causes.

And when you extract what is evidently present above it that you see with your tongue in the sunlight, place your wet tongue on this tool immediately to declare whether it' extraneous and within the goiter (glandular swelling).
When something has not appeared and is hidden within the stomach, which you make vomit by making it digestive food in your belly when that patient's malady appears; or if they have a portion of meat from their neck or legs made into porridge or bread crust for consumption – strong causes will lead to this emesis causing further release within the stomach. Then take hold tight, and transport it through the palatine structures where spit is expelled, thus removing what has been forced out there; once you have removed from that location whatever comes up when one vomits, then ensure their throat remains firmly held to prevent re-expulsion of this material into your mouth. May one take a snake and bind it with fleshly ties, or may they place a pad on the table and extract tools from there; alternatively, use a pot (likely referring to medical equipment) and suction pads for extraction.
If you have not yet determined these causes that we mentioned, then use a chisel of lead as described herein.

Translating this line from a medieval medical context, assuming it pertains to surgical procedures (based on the keywords "extraction" and possibly relating to appendicitis given your mention
When medicine is applied to the blood that we have at work in medical treatment and does not cause discomfort, consider then taking out (or removing) the appendix of inflammation from below the navel, provided you own an instrument for which it has been recommended by us.
Therefore, if you find a small or subtle injury in it, extract that portion carefully and delicately.
If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave cannula and insert that into the hollow of the bladder, placing your finger in the concavity of the cannula with a lit iron, applying as much heat (making sure that the urine becomes dead and remains within the bladder) to prevent it from leaking throughout the day.
Here comes the translation of each line:
May it not be that the ailment we have recommended is effective water or asphalt applied through an inserted tool used in steam treatment for the throat, then moisten and dampen (the haze) the area of inflammation with this substance to alleviate discomfort.
When it is necessary (it), make points over the surface of the foot with a pointed instrument (cautery).
Another manifestation of the operation in steam application is that you grasp an ignited mass within which there's coal and it has a cover (potentially referring to vapor or smoke), encapsulated by such covers, wherein also lies a tool; position your hand above this sub-fumigation. Keeping mouth at the extremity of the canula allows for steam inhalation while ensuring that you are aware when sublimination has reached the chest cavity (thorax). Once achieved here it may begin to expel forcefully ('cry').
If not already done so, then repeatedly perform the subfumigation movements, and prevent the malady from drinking, eat salty and alcoholic foods, and do not drink water, as it is necessary that this regimen be followed strictly.
This is the form of the tool with which one extracts gallstone when seen; it resembles pincers but has no curvature herein. The translated text line by line is:

The pegs are moved with specialties and needles as they remember their use in this free space of any one among them here mentioned.
Here various in piercing and cutting through their bodies by hands, of which one is due to the nature of appendages they insert themselves with; because as for extracting moisture from them.
The second manifestation is in the places where pains occur, for when an abscess appears on the head it is different from the abscess that occurs at joints – and each of them requires operation.
When some of these that are not pierced but represent the progression of disease in those places, come up as asthma symptoms at their joints or related areas.
So other apasts that are dislocated when crossed and aren't mature according to their complement, like those proper for joints, which become prolonged within these parts where the fluid circulates in it, corrupting its ligaments or nerves at this joint; if you delay penetration into such a body part until it is ripe inside another member – be it major or minor – then pierce that not yet matured one, but do not damage what lies within. If the incision made while crossing does not complete digestion, only those near the anus will suffer incomplete evacuation and elongate to parts of the intestine therein; otherwise, it becomes a fistula or inflammation that is present in its location but isn't healed. May you know the time of the puncture for the abscess, and so it is when it ripens.
E understand that it matures when the pain subsides and fever ends, reduce the decrease of speech and heartbeat, sharpening the headache'dictum: And other symptoms as well.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When the abscess is in the flesh, then we must perform its incision only when confirmation of digestion has been obtained; but if you pierce it at this time, the patient's limb will be prolonged and their lips hardened, as well as increasing the depth.
May an incision be made according to the direction of the flesh or bone as required, or according to what part of the body demands it.
When administering a small incision, and large punctures or wide incisions according to the size of the apasts,
Other interventions are needed where the coda (anus) is opened and narrowed due to pus formation; similarly when bread or similar foods cause pain, apply what you use for treating these same conditions in blistering episodes of feverishness with blood boils.
From those who have three joints seated (in their body), and in which they are arranged like the feathers of a quill or the pins of an angle:
From those where it is administered—round and crescent-shaped doses—they seem similar.
May it be that he who cannot bear with the surface lions' pains also endures only a shallow puncture above; if so far they have not yet been pierced by such means of relief, let them now suffer under your cautery sharp enough to perforate superfthy.
And when the abscess is large and has collected pus, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; remove some from that place today, restore what was removed tomorrow, take out a larger part on another day, following progress according to degree until fully extracted (drained).
Mostly if the malady is caused by phlegm or female prenancy, or in a small child or elderly person whose spirit moves to exit disease and thus dies from it; then you perform operations on them.
1. Take great care in this matter, and place your incision where you pierce these thorns, so as to avoid contracting diseases; consider whether the disease of the thorn is small or flat, then administer those remedies suitable for it or contemporary antidotes; if the thorn is large, and there are fissures in the incision site, cover each with a cloth pad where we shall meet.
If in the abscess it has detached a part of the colon or if that area is concave within the circuit, then cover it with fine cloth or linen as you carry out pans and razors; apply moisture to this place immediately afterward; compress it tightly until evening time. Treatment for such abscesses should follow prompt care once they are attended to in these ways.
May you introduce a flow of sanct (sanctioned fluid) during your operation, and apply poultices impregnated with these herbs on the bandages applied to it; pause above where the movement of the body'dictions thirsty fluids are directed.
If the flow of blood persists, then when you attend and care for it with these recommended powders in places specified by our book and division.
If it is winter time and the site of ulceration is a place where nerves are vulnerable, then cover them with powder made from vinegar and oil, placing these over those areas.
If it is summer and the places are carnivorous, then when you rest pulpils at the beginning in water and oil as we have said before today, so that all this enters into your body until the fresh day has come according to our saying, now also cover up the oozing ulcer and cleanse it away from there for its healing.
So it is necessary that the knowledge of curing spurts be acquired universally, maybe according to how I have distinguished each type here for individual treatment purposes.

When arthritis comes into the chest area, it means that inflammation characteristic of rheumato0rism is affecting not just joints but also involves areas
When arthritis affects the chest area (specifically referring to joint inflammation), it contains glands that hold their capsules; and these are its causes.

The section (or "capitolo" in Italian, which could be a term for chapter or part within the larger context of a medical treatise) that describes how lip pain can cause abdominal discomfort ("ac
In this section (or "capitolo"), it is explained that those individuals with excessive mucus in their bodies have constant throat discomfort ("acidede las llagues del chil al ventre") and similar complaints occurring elsewhere on the body where there are substances likened to fungi, which represent a fine or subtle base atop of it; moreover, those very lips (of such individuals) have been discussed earlier in this text. The term "motas" refers generically to mucus accumulations within bodily cavities that can cause discomfort and are associated with other body parts similar to fungi as described by the physician's observations or theories outlined previously, perhaps pointing towards an imbalance of humors leading to such conditions. This aligns somewhat loosely with medieval understandings where mucus was considered a pathogenic substance that could disrupt bodily harmony and lead to various symptoms as described by the author'sex
Herein is mentioned that within them (referring to patients) there were two types of substances in their bellies which looked like fungi; and these did not differ from each other because they had a simple or rudimentary nature ("menuda raitza"). This suggests an observation where the internal state, possibly related to digestive issues or imbalance as per medieval medical theories (humoralism), was characterized by two distinct forms of mucus-like matter inside that did not show significant
Herein the lips (of those patients) were turned outwards and they would spread apart; moisture was always flowing from them during this time ("tottemps"). This description could indicate a condition where there is excessive saliva or mucus production, leading to constant wetness around the mouth
So then I incised them one by eighteen units and another fifteen units in the body part where they are located, respectively.

The given medieval medical text is in Latin with traces of Romance languages such as
Of care for the hump (umbilicus)". In this context, it likely refers to attending to or tre
The hump (umbilicus) is painful due to movements or cracks in the diaphragm above which it lies; and when cloth or a cushion follows these ruptures as they come into being, or because of constriction at this place where blood vessels flow according to what has been said herein before (referring possibly back to earlier statements about pressure on veins), pain is felt.
If there is a crack in the cistern and leakage from the fabric (possibly referring to some form of wound or skin condition), then the appearance of the ulceration resembles that of the body; it hurts like a lion, which can appear in various situations. If it is due to the extrusion of the hernia, then at that moment you have recorded what we had noted previously about its fluid content and varying degrees of violence; now take heed (be attentive) as this situation may change rapidly, and return here with urgency. Moreover, enhance your intervention by vigorous bathing and exertion.
If it is due to moisture, then I will be the lion and won't disappear when you place your hand on me; nor shall I contract or grow in size.

And when performing the operation on it is considered whether the navel'supremacy (umbilicus) is due to a stone or cure, prohibited by its treatment; if so, in that case there is fear and concern as taught in the Capitol where I have previously mentioned instruments for chiseling away at stones and veins.
If the prominency of the navel is due to the intestine or tent, then order that which controls it should take hold and be extended; also set your watch on all around the navel as you have indicated upon its site where there are hands above—and position those within between their own bodies over it. Also command who stands opposite of them (implying a midwife), to encircle with spine or ligature along the pathway surrounding the umbilical cord at this location; and expand the bandage around these parts, as well as where there is strength from falcet/hook for tightening.

The phrase "de curacio de cranc" can possibly mean the care or treatment
The translated text in English reads: "We have discussed, within the division of skull and its medical care, how it is directed by doctors to prevent ulcers; we also know that headaches are born from neglect or lack of proper treatment." This translation attempts to convey concepts related to neurology as understood during medieval times. It suggests a belief in direct cause-and-effect relationships between the level of medical care for cranial conditions (such as skull injuries) and outcomes like headaches, emphasizing preventative measures against complications such as ulcers due to neglect or insufficient treatment ("ferr"). The text reflects medieval medicine's attempt at understanding neurological symptoms within the context of humoral theory.
The translation to English: "Regarding ancient headaches that may occur in such places as the breasts or abdomen and their resembling limbs when they begin with children." Here we are delving into medieval beliefs about where certain types of pain might originate from, especially those associated with conditions affecting what today would be understood as breast tissue (mamillas) in females. This implies a humoral understanding—headaches were not merely brain-related issues but could also involve the body's internal 'humors,' which must be balanced for health to prevail. The reference might suggest that these headache types are common when children start exhibiting symptoms, reflecting medieval practitioners’ concerns with pediatric conditions and their relationship (or supposed lack thereof) to adult ones within the framework
The translation to English: "When ancient and grave headaches occur without the properties of that particular medicine for it not cures such ailments in them nor have I seen another come." This statement speaks volumes about medieval medical practice's understanding (or misunderstanding) regarding treatment efficacy. Here, there seems to be an admission by the practitioner—that despite possibly having knowledge or theories of what should work against headaches that are severe and old ("antiquat e gra"), they have found no rem

This line, written in a mix of archaic language that seems to draw upon Latin roots and medieval medical terminology (potentially influenced by Italian or French), describes certain conditions affecting the penis' foreskin:
Constantly grinding in this bed causes discomfort and protruding of fatty flesh.
From that one is harmful, and from the other not harmful.
No harmfulness, cover that suspends under the delicate and removes what is within it therein; apply pressure over that spot with Egyptian wax submerged in oil herewith, and this too for healing inside whereby said entity may be cured.
If the gallbladder is dark in color and enlarged, then you must apply caustic substances to its interior and exterior.
May it be that the foreskin of the head of the penis is not circumcised, and one part removed (circumcision), while another remains intact; where you have cut off this remaining portion so thoroughly during communion to ensure its removal completely, until after healing. And when your care addresses this operation on the foreskin again, it cannot be ensured that it will not tear.

May it be that a flow of sanctus (sanctioned or divine) is necessary and in this way administers the luna'dictory (moon-gazing therapy):
Quarly two devices assist in healing, one is the flow of blood and another is pus when it becomes corrupted.
If the head of the gallbladdig is corroded and destroyed at once, then it's necessary to insert a bronze tube into the flesh of the foreskin immediately, allowing the bile to flow through that pipe.
In the attachment of the prepuce at the base of the foreskin (and this adherence is not excised from where it clings, nor circumcision exerted upon it; when attached due to dirt or scab) comes corruption that you must scrape out inside which dissolves the ligament and clears off completely the head of the foreskin.
If it is difficult to reach those exquisitely, then have someone prick the small of the back or penis, and so gently do you pierce through their subtlety with a sharp instrument.
And separate between the foreskin and head of hair down to where it is moistened by humidity so that nothing else sticky does not attach there.

The translation of this Latin-influenced sentence into English would be:
Circumcision is not a solution for continuity with other plagues: however, when it comes from our operation and intention, especially in children, we must assign them the simpler path to salvation through gentle release of urine.
So it is said that ancient ones did not perform circumcision around the time of freedom, nor do they use for their laws, and only when they have acquired through experience this causes them to abandon a large part of artisans and barbarians; using sinew from a hind leg and scalp hair.
E you have already tried all these methods and cannot do any better with tools or glue that in unguent (medicated ointment), where motes flee from under the waistband, beneath the testicles within two tunics, and rush upward through porous bodily humors, leaving you helpless for other insights and safe pain relief.

The text provided appears to be instructional in nature from an ancient medical perspective with terminology
In the treatment of retained urine within the bladder, it can refer to various clinical situations where a patient is unable to empty their bladder naturally due
Retention of urine in the bladder is considered a fault caused by excess warm humors within the body—which could stem from sources such as meat, fats (lard or rendered fat), pork products, and sometimes even due to consuming cold items like ice. It seems that this medical belief held during medieval times aligns with what was traditionally thought of malady being linked to imbalances in the body's fluids—similarly reflected by various humoral theories existing at different periods (Latin: 'humores').
If it is not dissolved by the water we have mentioned, then intense pain will occur in the groin area due to what you are drawing out with a syringe that takes on this form: It may be made of silver and subtle lion capture, similar to an elongated slender stick (like a pen needle), which is fine enough for use at the top of one'thy head.

Here, the Latin-influenced text seems to describe a medical procedure involving enemas and specific instruments that are in accordance with it:

From stone extraction/removal – this phrase likely refers to a procedure related to the removal of
From stone extraction/removal – we have it in the division of species for medicine care and understanding the difference between stones originating from urethral discharge (urea) versus those formed within the bladder (uric acid), as well as their signs or symptoms.
And here it has been said that surgery was performed within this stone and a portion of it remains intact today.
When produced in the bladder specifically is that which lies within the bladder itself.
As I recount that which has been exposed and abbreviated by him.
So it is said that stone formation mainly occurs in the bladder during childhood; and from its kidnethy (kidney), the urine excreted by it resembles water in subtlety, appearing therein (within); and phlegmatic inflammation affects its flank/waist area. The disease brings forth painful movements of these parts into this place; hence they drag their entrails through here for the forum's drainage hole.
And it is when the hygiene of those children within that have reached fourteen years, and their care in the limbs becomes difficult. May also travel through these waters among those who are between them.
From that from which the stone is larger and poultice placed lighter; if it is scarce, contrary to it.

Return that which has fallen for each one; return all of it.
Therefore, if you feel pain in space (referring perhaps to abdominal or pelvic discomfort), then press your hand immediately over it.
If you have not touched the entire body yet, then when it is indicated by your touch on the left side of the patient's abdomen if they are a pregnant woman or during their infancy phase, place that part inside the belly. Through the vein where blood was inside that day flows now. When that small one is converted into something within the bladder's neck (which seems like an attempt at describing some procedure related to addressing urinary issues):

If there is not an opening made through the gout (for here), then you will have to create one over that area, or where it hurts intensely and with a knife may make interventions; do so on the skin without evading from doing so – immediately insert carefully crafted small curved instruments.
If you cannot cover it there, then slightly increase the disruption and if you see a flow of pus, separate them with strong vinegar that has been triple distilled.
If the stone is inside one of them (the bladder or vagina), then you will lead it to the mouth of the urinary bladder, and place your finger over this area; also carry a small catheter herein; apparently they are pains from pleasure.
If it is stone great in size, ignorance leads you to insert that large piece into the bladder; for then one of two causes occurs: either because it remains there or due to continuous urine distillation from within, thus not fully sealing the location.
When administering the removal of it from within that has been expelled or is present in a broken bone fragment inside where extraction takes place, ensure this occurs under guidance when it's outside (presumably during surgery).
So when you have completed your task, then fill the womb of our essence with the juice of aloe and of dragon'dictorax, and strengthen it thusly. And when pressure is applied over that hot cloth dipped in oil and vinegar (or wine), it helps to expel the suppuration.

When that air escapes, apply water and oil to the affected area, with care applying it as lubricant and soothing balm within which healing can occur.
If in the patient there is an abscess that has become hard and rotten (and it appears as if the sanctum [bladder] is congealed), then insert the catheter into the bladder, for through this means urine can no longer escape due to putrefaction of both the bladder and its contents.

The clear one will not harm a learned woman like this, mostly in operation.
And the fourth is that the location of the section over the breast in women' extruded part (the uterus) extends beyond its own place, so there should be an advance of the section, and at this time it causes fear.

So do this present thing and command the patient to hold all that you have directed him/her, from inquiry about the stone in the sieve until meal time; which is because if the woman has pubic hairs, then take it with your hand into his/her private parts where he desires.
Then if you have grasped it (the condition), clamp that part down immediately and command the patient to lie on top of that area.

A hernia is simply the accumulation of moisture in white skin that quickly lies beneath the waistline where body fluids are contained within our guts; hence it's called a 'belly.' In this line, "herno" (related to or pertaining to) and its root word might suggest an issue with fluid build-up leading to protrusion of internal organs through weak spots in the abdominal wall. This medieval understanding aligns more closely with what
Some cautions are in the pancreatic (possibly referring to an internal condition related to fluid accumulation) that nature provides within the part of our gut where another humor resides; and this is not just under white skin but rather at the navel region we mentioned, which consists chiefly of tart flesh. Here it seems they discuss how cautions or remedies (perhaps treatments for gouty arthritis) may come from internal sources like pancreatic secretions—not only external moisture as previously thought but something more integral to the body's own digestive system, suggesting an understanding that conditions can be influenced by one’s diet or bodily functions.

The objective is likely to alleviate discomfort associated with inguinal (groin) hernias and restrain physical movement that might exac

This line translates into English as follows: "We say that when you lift the hernia over an elevated bedpan; and secure in position the testicles at their joints below (as pertaining to scrotal placement); take hold of your coda, which part is tender due to pressure tests performed on it during examination. And extend these parts with vigorous stretch." Here we interpret a detailed instruction for physical manipulation techniques that may have been employed in medieval times as an intervention for certain conditions related to the male genitalia or scrotum—likely referring to treatment and palpation of hernias, testicular positioning, examining signs through pressure tests (palpations), identifying tender areas possibly caused by underlying issues like varicoceles, securing instruments in place for further assessment/treatments, and performing stretch exercises or manipulations. The language used indicates a hands-on approach with an emphasis

This appears to be an instruction or heading related to treating intestinal protrusion (herniation). A
The appearance of this hernia is due to a section that has extended beyond the stomach's diaphragm (the partition between abdominal and chest cavity), leading such protrusions into partakers within these compartments, indicating rupture. A term like "capitol" here could refer either metaphorically to a head office or literally as an instrumental device used in surgical procedures—perhaps implying that it is time for treatment of the hernia due to its progression beyond usual boundaries within these body compartments, signifying rupture and subsequent risk
This rupture is either of the diaphragm or due to excitement (possibly referring to stress-induced symptoms), and these causes exacerbate them: through impacts such as strikes with objects causing concussions, excessive use like overworking oneself leading to strain ('too much labor'), loud noises provoking distress, elevation of any burdensome cause that is severe in nature, or imitation (mimicry) which can also induce symptoms. A term "capitol" here may be metaphorically referring again as a head office responsible for overseeing such causes and their management within the treatment context—or it could
The term "capitol" in this context may refer to the cause or origin (possibly a source of stress), and when there is extension from such extenuation, it leads only gradually without immediate severe consequences ('does not immediately worsen'), but over time can result in weakening within body cavities. It further explains that as one ages with these chronic conditions ("the senhal of age"), they are prone to little and slow decline rather than sudden deterioration, possibly due to the pressure (impact) on internal structures such as organs over time caused by a protruding diaphragm. It seems here that "capit

This suggests corrective measures are taken within five days which include returning and securing what has been done with the cautery inside—likely implying some form of thermal treatment aimed at easing or alleviating pain caused by its extension, possibly addressing issues such as arthritis in a way that aligns with medieval medical practices. The use of specific terms like "ciphac" and timeframe reflect the historical context where treatments might involve localized application over set periods for symptom management within this framework of belief systems about healthcare during those times, often intertwining empirical observations with spiritual or supernatural explanations

The text suggests strong prohibitions against such remnants, emphasizing cleanliness to prevent this condition. Moreover, it forbids engaging in activities that could exacerbate the problem: opening containers ('cuoyt

If there is an obstruction beneath and it's related to the lips of desire (indicating sexual pleasure or dissatisfaction), then remove that blockage with your tool (implying a manual intervention).

The woman should lie with her back and thighs extended as these positions may facilitate the rupture of that subtle blockage, at which point it is removed ("urbta"). In this approach to healing or alleviation of distress from a constriction (possibly referring to physical pain due to obstructed flow in medieval medical theory), one would position her comfortably and then carefully work on the lips' pressure points. This procedure might align with ancient therapies that combined massage, manipulation, and an understanding of body meridians indicative

Based on the given text and attempting to interpret it with an understanding of its linguistic roots, which seem reminiscent of a blend between Latin and regional languages such as Italian or Spanish (given that "matronas" refers to nurses in both cultures), here is my translation into modern English:
Necessary is that the matron observes and smells the fragrance of a woman'se natural figure at certain times for scenting air; thus being covered by this vapor, she must quickly prepare her childbirth essentials, knowing well that this part represents second nature's form—the placenta is suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
So when you tighten those joints, it is necessary to compress the patient'thy belly so that the embryo will not come out while they are on their head; give them a second one (possibly referring to additional medicinal items), and cleanse away any excess with good purification.
May another part of him not be natural and unbearable when he suffers on his feet and the head becomes heavy above his neck; similarly, it might also happen that it is between the chest or back (the lumbar region), where its weight lies upon one's shoulders, causing discomfort. Likewise, if this part naturally causes distress to oneself when in a fixed position—whether sitting on the ground with crossed legs and leaning forward onto one’s headrest atop their chest or back (the lumbar region), then turning that heavy weight over upon one's shoulder blade area; such parts are unbearable.
When necessary, it is for the midwife who needs to be wise and subtle about all these matters, so that she can avoid mistakes and deceit.
When showing all of their figure in those things, and by which means it is indicated for the physician therein, that they stand upon water (i.dict "aquos").
When the foot is in contact with its head naturally, it hurts a lot on that difficult part and sometimes becomes weakened; at those times, apply this poultice which women hold onto their heads (and use elsewhere), made of fenugreek seeds and hops from old mills.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Place a metal rod between your fingers and thighs near it that contains moisture within its unguent, or secure this object itself with another soaked in liquid from which there is excessive fluidity due to humidity. When pressing the woman'dictum begins as she bears the child.
If not done, then the woman must be anointed with honey and pearl powder to massage her skin.
Here comes the command to Lu (the patient), apply pressure on his belly where it' extruding is happening now; and with your mouth and nose you will observe this temporarily until we proceed further at once.
If more than their flesh is exposed at the joints due to cutting (incision), it becomes necessary that you gradually reduce those parts back together gently. If she does not obey the inside (medicine/treatment), then lift her up on a couch and remove her feet from undernethy, and place the cushion over it; thus ensuring that the woman will not fall due to fainting caused by medication.
If the mass is not turned down and becomes soft like flesh, then you must inspect those areas immediately and remove it from under your cloth or cut away that portion where there's equality with the fetus body, as this indicates rupture (ruptura).
When the belly rises above their feet, you then push those downwards and make them small again; likewise for each individual leg bone, grasp one hand of it and squeeze gently until they become smaller bit by bit.
When he enters between the thighs, then you command him to express himself, and make that protrusion conformable, provided if God wills it so.
If there is no outflow of water that has been recommended to us, then return the small fetus gradually within where the second figure'gyte occurs naturally; and when this happens, it means an expulsion (birth).
If it is forbidden that all the humors have been recollected, then take muscle from above and dissolved gum for treatment, beat them thoroughly in the mortar for good percussion, apply lines of this mixture to the woman' extraneous body fluid (presumably referring to menstrual flow or abnormal vaginal discharge), specifically within her womb. Return that limb in water so you can achieve relief from indigestion (epitomizing distension of the stomach).
When parts of it are softened and washed under the mistlethrush (likely referring to some kind of mild heat or steam treatment), apply that moisture over them, along with pausing for what is needed at each spot. When subfumigation lasts an hour, then lift the flesh above a sharp knife and extend it outward from its mouth, taking some of that away, pressing firmly on the lower part of the patient's abdomen with a tight compression; thus they feel relieved.
Evening treatment is necessarily dependent upon one of its extremities (usually referring to a limb). When it is in reduction of its mass (the patient), if you cannot reduce that yourself, then raise the woman and let her go to achieve that.
If it is not possible to proceed further, then have the patient lie on their back and press down firmly on the hips of him/her with forceful blows; concurrently apply bandages made from linens which you previously recommended for leeches.
If childbirth has come about, then they apply that which is necessary on the cesspit (likely referring to herbs or some form of medication), and study how to reduce swelling, shaping the fetus into its second natural figure, causing it to contract so as for entry through the birth canal.
Eye examination of the belly expanded its masses and the facial area is two fingers below the navel. When the matron holds her hand over the fetus and gently turns it little by little, this makes things easier.
When he has entered as much as he is able, and the pause rests on his chest with what we have applied oil and pulp woolen dressings to it.
Here comes the translation: Exit of the fetus prepared over the side (of the body or positioned)
When the uterus overflows according to this condition of menstruation, consider it and when you inspect the second one inside your finger where its fluid can be expelled so that there is no excess moisture left behind.
If the fetus is suspended on the face and chest of him/her, then you insert that part of the embryo to prevent it from being retained or delayed in its movement.
Here the text instructs as follows when translated line by line into English:
Exit of twins or fetuses (or multiple) is here mentioned as a possible medical condition that may need attention in this medieval text on Where twins are carried naturally and sometimes there may be three or four (cases), it can seem strange to see them moving around—it might indicate causes from nature that they cannot survive inside the womb. Alternatively, these could also stem from other reasons not related to natural birth circumstances.
With these things, even if they are suppositories too large or secondary ones inserted by hand, separated for use with catheters, remove those intestines from the belly of each person in some occasions as a natural remedy during childbirth and at other times using recommended measures.
If it is difficult for them to bear their burdens and come upon us with descriptions of figures not natural, then take care of these children as we have described.
If the maid is subtle and brings fluid that makes things easier and more delicate, as well as timely intervention according to how she has prepared for healing at this time, then her role contributes significantly to recovery. (Translation of each line)

It appears that the text is in Old Spanish with some Latin influence due to medical terminology and syntax reminiscing medieval times when multiple languages were often used interchangeably, especially within learned professions like medicine which was heavily influenced by Greek and Arabic knowledge as well:
If the head is sick and compressed by the shoulder blade, then it has been opened inside wherein the moisture that resides in the chest has become outpoured.
If it is not complicated and you do not fear treatment, then cut the head as far as possible according to what you can manage for yourself.

May it be if the child is large or due to insufficient space and appearance, and their lips are not properly adjusted with forceps as recommended for their stitching.
May it be discovered that the child has parts of bone and pen exposed, but not restrained by him; thus insist on those areas with medicine to restore flesh back into its proper place within the body, and command the malady (the illness) in which they crave forbs such as heads and forms of cough herbs, ensuring it is concocted.
If decay is present in the spine and does not adhere to the bone, then you will incise all this putrefied matter and draw out the fluid with care.
If in these diseases the artery or vein from which blood flows is not cut off by medicine, then you should examine that vessel; and if it has been torn but not severed completely, incise into that very same with a sponge or lia (a ligature), until such time as what we have said does not cause discomfort. If the wound needs to be provoked for treatment purposes, then cauterize within the vessel where it has been cut off.
If these pains are simple and small, then their cause is chilliness; therefore, take powder over those places until the air changes them thereafter.

When any one makes self-catheterization alone without being in your presence and with sanctioned lime or sulfur,
And now this operation takes place on the large swellings when it is decided that they should be stopped and stretched out, these swellings whose air has not changed since their formation.
If the air has been altered, and especially in summer time, you may not understand its position here, but take care of those dripping substances we have mentioned earlier; cease pouring these excess oils or honey-water into them, where they leak out upon their surfaces. And make sure that all such liquids are stopped while the cure is taking place inside them.
If bone breaks are dealt with mud or clay and it is small, then extract the matter through motion (gesture).
When directing the care of skull fractures caused by poison (envenimer), here is the translation line by line into English:
From diseases of the colon
If you find pain in the chest of a child (the term "plagna" here refers to a small patient or child), it is not different in medicine and between the neck when simple.
May it be that the nerve of the colon or artery is inspected and if so, it's not in their body but rather to avoid its own care at home with strong stoicism, as when they feel sickness and resemblance similar to worms within them. No causes any fear without the humors being hot and circulating throughout the body, which is placed in the head by itself; this substance constitutes all of the limbs.
If water is needed for the treatment of folk remedies, take some warm or cold water as desired, and apply poultices made from herbs/minerals according to this methodology; also use oil (rosary) when bathing with water along with other stones, applying heat during baths and using ointments.
If the child is large, administer stitches or clamp down their lips, and take care that these are applied until they heal.
May it be that if there is depth or pain in the lower part of the body'dictory (which could mean womb), then pierce through it at this place using a metgeught (metge, which refers to an old English physician).
If in the patient there is an inserted artery and blood flow has been obtained, then separate or dry out that particular one if necessary; otherwise apply cautery to it.
May you have already inserted the vertebrae of the collarbone or all, and thus saved the veins in the neck; do not touch that area with your lips as sewn on the collarbone'dictum (presumably a suture), without disturbing its natural shape. Tighten it through straining so applied to figure out naturally, leaving it for days until healing occurs within which points of stitches and inflammation have been addressed; further care is provided in these areas where sewing has occurred.
May if the child already has pain in their bones, then you will strike that area; and if there are fragments of bone within them, remove all those pieces which you can from them; but if it is not possible for you to do so internally, let water enter where the child feels discomfort, causing swelling to subside and separation (of fractured parts) facilitated.
If the child is freshly born today and powder should be applied on that which has been recommended, then apply it there as well. May it be that if there is an opening in the patient (plagiar), then take care of that which will remember to come back into its own cavity, as directed by itself at its head (seat or origin).
If it is percussion of lance or cottle, and sometimes the depth, then pay attention if from the mud comes windy breathing when the bladder fills up; you know that the clay (mud) is lifeless.
If there is no depth and the patient's humors are recently released in their abdomen, then stop them immediately after the first hour of morning ointment application, so that none of the humor remains deep within the body cavity and returns to the chest where it aggravathe malignancy; may you pause with oil-attracted bandages thereafter for daily care.
If the unguent (ointment/salve) is not at your disposal, then rest in the bath with water drawn from where creatures live for that which comes out of moisture; and make sure that gout (the condition being treated - possibly edema or swelling associated with joint pain like arthritis) lies on the ground so as to allow fluid movement within it.
May you have passed three days or more without spasm in the abdomen nor fever, tremor of a bad heart, and constipation, and if so, take the other good things available to you; then care for that which is healed within it.
If the healing of it is allowed to proceed and has been ongoing at all times, then you will understand that a fistula (a hole or abnormal connection between two body parts) has formed; therefore attend to this with your own knowledge as best you can.
If the swelling is due to opening of a space or incision, and it's simple on the surface of the skin or back, then treat that with water previously used for stitching if large (sutures), or powder if small (stitches).
May there be pain in the bone already, and your intestines are distended (enlarged), if they have separated from each other; then use forceps to extract those contents gently. If they are not separated, then let them be released that the vermin may escape from their lodging (extraction).
From other accidents affecting the rest of the body, health is restored by what we have here described as water (or humors).
From intestinal diseases/disturbances.
The discomgy that you experience in your belly is great, little, or wandering.
A minor disruption is felt as a result of another's carelessness; they find it hard to reduce them unless you withdraw the intervention from their place, for when our touch becomes involved, movement thereof turns difficult. Here 'disrupcio petita es fayta dificil per autra manieyra,' translates as a minor disruption is felt due to someone else's negligence; and it implies that correcting or resolving the issue ('reduccio de lor') becomes challenging if not for removing our involvement, which might further complicate things (as indicated by 'engrossat per que le intrament de lu es fayt difficil').
And so the best interruption would be here, as it is difficult in these areas described previously with regards to their reduction (of a hernia).
E understand that the abdomen' extrication is performed by four kinds of methods; if there are needle stitches needed, they can be common as for other diseases on the body.
Two other stitches communicate with each other and possibly also directly within the abdominal stitch itself.
When you recommend this one thing for examination and declaration.
So when the child is small and suffers from some cause of hernia, it's difficult to reduce that, either because of its diminutive size or due to inflation caused by cold air:
When water comes in, then when you cut that which is submerged beneath a wet cloth alone or squeezing into the water with squinted eyes and cyperum, pepper, and pads are placed within where inflammation can be resolved.
And when dipping in such a way that there is sufficient contact with the wound, it is better than water alone for healing inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then moisten the intestine in the water where it was swollen and painful; thus are we able to relieve its discomfort due to a little cause (presumably an injury or illness).
If there is an escape of the humor from this treatment, then divide it into small pieces using a tool to which pus has been applied (emphysectomy).
The initial sentence translates as follows in English line by line:
Of that tool, its form is as follows:
The one sharp turn of the bone, and the other not acute, and the subtlety which is neither in the thinness nor thickness of its shaft – these are both blunt ends (angles).
So when the patient' extruded a bulge and it comes out of its place, then reduce it to its natural shape in its own location if possible on top of that, which is better for them.
May when the disruption is wide and in the lower abdomen area where you have made the hernia protrude on its two sides, take hold of your patient's waist with both hands; if it is below the belly region, press down their head and shoulders using cushions placed under them.
Here comes the first source sentence: If disruption is in one of the parts of the belly, then pause your understanding and consideration immediately so that whatever lives inside can be set free without delay.
And when you apply treatment for these large and painful pus formations,
In small pains, take what you have prepared for it, and make the minister between your own fingers, which holds the entire disruption in its mouth and adjusts the lips of him/herself accordingly, as well as tends to any suture that has caused this issue from other causes.

Here are the translations line by line:
Might the second stitch be considered common: and it is that you gently apply a stitch to the four extremities (hands/feet), from the navel downwards, using an awl as needle with finesse and thickness.
When the needle has entered these four extremities, reduce the needle of that portion from which you are taking it out, to ensure that the wound'dictum ascends into its divided part below and thus make suture with cloth as usual drape layer above so tightly.
When there is a pause between any stitch of the said body part' extranous size (thickness), it implies that adjustments or additional work might be needed on this area during treatment, considering its thickness
This indicates that a specific amount has been used for the stitching of said body part and suggests attention to detail in
This line indicates that there was a suture made by hand where the patient had previously been grazed inside their belly, which involved blood greater than half of an adult palm in size and required intervention from various bulls (possibly referring to medical personnel or instruments) within two hands' reach. Moreover, it describes reducing what has accumulated there for a period equivalent to 24 hours under this treatment approach.
And when the child is solidified in these spaces within fourteen days or thereabouts, and healed for that wound, apply pressure with movement to prevent recurrence over time; his disposition will be corrected as a result.
E the other doctors had not healed him; and by some miracle of fire, which neither oil nor any medicine could treat that ailment in its place where it was located, perhaps they cured two visits per day with honey-infused water poured into the focus for as long as the flame remained lit.
May you direct two types of stitches according to what is narrated in Paraylok.
When you begin with stitching of the neck, and insert the needle from the cut flesh into the cut sides.
And when the needle enters into the cleft and through that opening, it goes down entirely along all of one's body; take hold on the extreme end where you have inserted the needle; then insert the other needle from part to part in the opposite extremity of my flesh.
When you have felt that penetration, then make another penetration in the extreme end of this limb from where it started to here; and withdraw the extraspinal portion present therein now, and insert the needle into its other extremity back here.
When it is necessary for your instrument to enter the body, so that everything enters into the cavity at its extreme end wherein you are within which all things will go in:
E begins at this side of the body and takes that away from there, reaching into the other cheek's crevice, cutting with the needle in the navel which penetrates, taking it back to that same place inside the belly button, removing whatever is part of you (as indicated by "es"). Then cut what remains at this location within your body.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And make an application and another, and apply one of them within what you are doing so that it may restore as much as possible according to that example.
The sum total of this suture technique is that you sew the skin with a thread on which you sew the hairs, ensuring to stitch along the part of the extremity'thy (patient) leg where arises pain, leaving another stitch in place until it is completed.
May the second species of suture that Gualia dictates and recommends through speech is for you to sew together this intermediate size wound as treated by healers here; so all parts are joined in accordance with nature, applying another limb'seam from one part attached thereto, matching it with the corresponding extremity of like attachments on other body areas. This should be done following Gualia's recommendations for optimal results:
Where you keep the needle at your appointed place on the divided part, and make that enter into the divided part therein, and turn over both ends of the catheter; then rotate the needle so that it enters the divided part through both extremities of the catheter.
Here the swolthy joints are revolved, and cold humors enter into each division between parts inside as opposed to those on the contrary sides of the body in both limbs that are observed hereinabove.
This surgical thread is better than the common ligature used herein, and it has a memory of past procedures as well.
This is the discourse of Guaya
And if you have made the stitches of the abdomen with two needles so that they can enter into these four places, and begin to introduce your inserted needle accordingly in accordance with those sutures by which their chests are tied together.
When you understand that a disturbance occurs in the abdominal area of the womb (uterus), then its repair is more difficult than at other locations within the womb.
May the game of medicine for fools be judgment among other diseases.
The cause is when you continue the plague recently contracted from their sickness above while returning the intestine and hernia to its cavity, stopping them appropriately over that corporeal dust they have caught on themselves, so as not to spread it further:
If the air has altered the humidity, then rest upon that cloth where you presently are entering and make hard leather shoes for the fields; they shall become strong as remedies for other diseases within which one is healed at this time.
May you not have the medicines present with you at this moment; place them where just now they were put for today'dictation to start, and continue their use until healed as instructed by you—so that no other medicine is needed when these plagues become simple.
If you fear that the vermin will communicate in injury to the primary members, then when you submerge wool in oil of mellow quality or vinegar-like liquid, pause it within the spaces between the joints and around the limbs' sections where tendons are located.
If there is pain or putrefaction in your intestines, they will continually come back into the cavity you have inside yourself; and if an obstruction has reached its point within that space and causes itching with black excretions from it (which means a severe abscess), then:
When you know that what is in the large intestine (big bowel) heals quickly, it means that what is inside the small intestines also heals quickly.
It is difficult for the budge (hernia) that which it calls "gon" to receive healing from outside help due to:
If what comes out of the dirt is silk (silkworm cocoons), then you will obtain that new one quickly after reducing those bandages on which it rests.
If space has been passed and black or darkened substance (likely referring to blood clots) is present in the area where it'se darkened, then press down firmly on that spot with your faithful hand, so that the flow of sanctus fluid through veins and arteries can be expelled.

Remember when you have inflammation in the intestine (budel).
When bleeding occurs in the intestine and is slighted, it may be restored with cold homes for so long as that which was causing pain inside its cavity – a worm residing there since percussion of the belly and wind movement (possibly indicating gas or bloating) – an ancient parasite infected by fistula.
Now apply the treatment to him and it may cease subtly that which is inside his body where health is being restored and the location becomes solidified.

And experienced practitioners who when the patient encounthy in the intestine or hernia are called to intervene: take large swabs of clean cloth; adjust the lips of the affected individual with these and pause a piece from those that protrude outside their mouth, so as you grip it tightly, separate its head without dissolving.
Return your pace or another body part as the first priority, and do not cease doing so until you have formed one more as required by the entirety of the patient'thy mass.
Reduce that and return it to its place, within the belly wherein the belly itself is healed; do not harm any aspect of the malady for good health's sake.

This injury requires stitching as a secondary means of trust and hope.
May it be that the child is large and wide, primarily if within one of the delicate intestines, then they are not ill but rather a minor condition which cannot cure itself entirely.
Of treatment for ulcers and fistulas.
You understand that when all the young and apostomes become infirm and waxed without consolidation or healing over time in any part of the body, universally a fistula is formed; thus we call it this abscess.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When it is in a liquid state and drips like water, and then the fluidity decreases within several hours. Some moisture is moved here, and it's scant, dense, and subtle.
And have shown all those causes and their symptoms are under medical treatment in the division/section.
And when you know the treatment of an opening caused by surgery, which is due through operation itself.
E understand that fistulas occur in all body members, and those are the ones leading to major veins and arteries, or nerves, spinal column, bladder, any of the backbones' facet joints created by composition between ma (belly) and pe (chest), as well as other composite junctures; these contribute to proximity attraction towards the main limbs and their likenesses.
So that which of these ulcers from this illness is difficult to heal and does not receive care, it takes up labor and ignorance for itself.
If there is any depth to the fistula that does not reach these places mentioned herein and you wait and hope for its healing while desiring knowledge of it, then take an attempt with iron or silver tools, and if the fistula has been straightened out afterwards, inquire about this within yourself.
If the fistula is twisted, then investigate that subtle lead beneath your body'thy limb shall be lifted and straightened out due to its own elevation for correction of this curvature.
If there is an obstruction causing horror in it (referring to something like a blockage or abscess), then it'dict not within your possibility that you could attempt on top of it.
Now apply the poultice on his body using these ointments; through which moisture you use for catheterization, it will pass to other such medicines and from them flow outwardly.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When you have stood over all those causes and seen them as stitched or located in an area near the joint (or fistula), close to where bones meet, nerves are found, arteries flow, veins course, or any of these places that belong to you and which I tell you about:
When it is time as directed by its nature (the patient), dry out the fistula following those instructions; hold back what flows in that filtration area and any decayed or corrupted parts of the body'dict, which may include flesh from organs/meat pieces and similars. Treat this while it is healing within itself.
May it be that the fistula is deep and secondarily sealed, then cover what you can within its depth as quickly as possible; purify all of their corrupt flesh with wrapped medicinal pills, administer those inside the cavity of the fistula (which you have understood), for:
When it is necessary at times for the medicine to act within a few days, so that all the humors which are broken down in the cavity of the fistulous ulcer can be removed by acute treatment.
Return that which is within in wax or similar substances, for they generate healthy flesh inside while it heals.
If it is not healed by this remedy, then apply a second application of cautery on that part where we have applied previously.
May it be that the cause of fistula is bone or must you certify this, then inquire about that and dry it according to what we have recommended; if you do not prohibit any cause related to vein or nerve or major limb ailment as we've mentioned.
May it be that your bones have been discovered and there is some decay or blackness within, then take care of that which contains the corruption completely; attend also to this liquid (bodily humors) contained within so that it may become whole again.
If it is not healthy and beneficial as before to take the elixir (medicine), then you understand that you have not yet reached the complete eradication of corruption; hence observe closely and meticulously perform the action on yourself, restoring what has been lost at last.
And if it heals, you eat; but if not, then understand that the corruption is deep within the body and has not been resolved yet, so take action to address it there as well.
If the bones are decayed or can be pulled apart, then it is within your power to pull them out using delicate forceps, which I have agreed upon for this purpose.
If there is a stone in the bones, you must extract all of them carefully without any cause from weakening your strength.
May if any contrary cause of the fluids exists, and within their understanding there is no fear or mistake; here you will inspect those ligaments or bones that are present in this place, and separate the bones.
If you are not prepared with the bones of your hour (hips), then place it on the ground that moistens the ground whereon rests those very same bones, and ensure that this wetting does not solidify but is maintained for mending; also secure what has been set in position during your operation.
Having feared them (potentially referring to the patient), pause over it submerged in so much oil above or under Egyptian linen or any of their wax wrappings when they tighten those bands and ligaments, which separate from them, and thus are drawn away by these attractions.
May it be that the great bone (os magnum) joins with those of the knees or hips/thighs like them and if from there you have ruined your face to such an extent, then only for as long as necessary does this thing rest inside until its blackness and corruption are removed completely. And once that is done restore health (restaura plagia).
If the substance from within (perhaps indicating an infection or foreign material) has caused a great part of it to be spoiled and even reached the bone marrow, then this damage is necessary for closure; thus we must bring that which was corrupted inside out completely into its designated place where contamination occurred, so as to cure what's brought back there.
E you recommend that they go into the patient'se thighs so as to ease and assist with your work.
A young man of age xxx years old experiences pain in his groin, and the mucous material from the discharging parts enters into it, making its own putrefaction as severe decay (apostema), without external cause at this location.
And when the fever spreads because of errors made by doctors within it, and harmful materials are introduced into him/her, their healing focus is maintained until a fistulaous focus appears; there will be pus formations in these lesions where they previously applied poultices and moisture.
And after many years of treatment by doctors and not in their blood but within the arts, he was called back to health.

And then insert the attempt into one of those instruments, and guide it downward until it reaches the mouth of the instrument.
In preparation and examination, quickly inspect those instruments and place them with all parts of the wax for thoroughness.
And now you have cut and incised into one of the bones within which I had disarticulated it, and also corrupted that joint, already rotten and decayed; moreover, this damage has affected part of the cartilage inside where something penetrated.
Adorn you shall receive what I have discovered and prepared from bone.
And when it was not in the bone but that very corruption which had descended and been welded together, there already existed a fracture or breakage.
And place restraint for the patient' extrication with medicine that is meant to be binding over long periods of time; it has not been bound yet.
In accordance with your request for translation from the medieval medical treatise style into modern English:
When that which appears before me of this decay has been properly performed with gentle care and restoration for it is not restored yet.
And now you discover another wound and carefully insert the bone piece by piece in particulars, proceeding with healing the rest of it until inserted entirely within an outstretched hand's span, removing that which is inside its marrow; restore this extracted part using medicine, thereby consolidating ligaments and overall health.
Not necessary repetition in the operation of limbs and joints, but for the disposition of body fluids and tolerance reduction to pain and fear of death; for the patient is accustomed throughout all hours due to excessive evacuation during syncopal illnesses.
And so it heals entirely, and nothing remains in the hard bone; good is its disposition within its body, and returns to vitality; conversed among themselves without causing disruption during walking or harm from any cause.
If the bone protrudes in the joint and you see it swolthy (enlarged), then take that second action according to this manner: grasp with a ligament and stretch it at the extremity of that prominent bone, commanding an assistant to extend it further; use a thick wool thread from the first one used for tying. Fasten this thicker thread over the flesh where you want to cut (surgical incision), extending beyond its edge so as not to tear the flesh when sawing through.
When you press with a sword or tabletop on the face when it'se allowed not to cut off the corrupted flesh.
And if the wound has been little by little eroded at this location, and it does not appear in the state of bone decay until now; furthermore, other instruments have also served here before.
If the bones are decayed and not exposed, it is one continuous division, and rot occurs in either place or at that location; if there's delay (in treatment), fix all parts of the body entirely; apply cautery with haste from where the corruption begins – this wastage. Also ensure to have a blade ready for when part two emerges as continuation, and maintain it accordingly until such time comes again that continues onward another piecewise (corrupted section).
When a small screw is in place at the location of the corruption, as we have said before.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut out that corrupted joint, and saw off where it connects to other parts of the body.
If decay is in the continuous flow of joints, it'thy not due to reason but by design (or perhaps a flaw or malformation).
If the corruption is in the chest or the breastbone, it's difficult; however, if you seek out and find where the corruption appears on your body, and remove that portion according to any possible method available to you, then rectify this issue for yourself as long as it does not lead against your will (or bend a nerve).
Here you understand the tools and instruments used for these bones are determined by their situation (location), shape, size, subtlety, magnitude, finness, hardness, and rarity; so that whatever preparation is made for all types of surgical procedures will be appropriate.
You understand that this operation concerns the specificity of the instrument with which you are familiar; when it comes to your extensive knowledge and experience in handling these instruments, as well as witnessing treatments for illnesses, then you already possess what is necessary for its use concerning medical tools.

The extremities are swolthy or due to internal/external causes, or if the treatment of that defect by these medicines does not alleviate it, and at times the disease goes beyond a limb without being struck by any cause; hence you must insert this limb into water so that humors can escape from there, thus avoiding its decay due to death or malice (greater harm than damage).

If decay has already reached the sinew (denoul), it is not incurable but rather an expulsion from life, and thus remove the malady (gout) to death.
When the movement of inserting or cutting the limb is that you tighten the band at the joint where it will be inserted, and another band over the place, extending the minister' extraneous bands on both sides until all the flesh between them becomes exposed; separate the meat which lies between two sinews within so they can come out completely.

(The English translation conveys an instruction to present summaries in a chapter's introduction while emphasizing the importance for skilled workers like artisans and masons not only to have knowledge but also understanding of such matters.)
And thus it is said that when you experience a bone fracture or dislocation and twisting (sesame), if there'dict no specific cause preventing the procedure, then proceed with cauterization of this wound or repair of whatever has happened to them.

When the nose is broken, go for a repair in the eating establishment as quickly as possible to seek immediate medical attention and treatment
Be aware that when the nose is not broken but rather fractured into parts and pushed apart (perhaps due to some misfortduct), there are two bones involved; one of which contains cartilage, making it joint-like in nature ('quar la partida dejos es cartillaginosa'). These pieces aren'thy splintered or shattered but rather held together with a type of grinding and twisting motion that does not involve breaking into separate fragments. This condition is often described as 'bending,' which suggests the bones may be out of place due to misalignment ('atricio e tortuositat') without completely fracturing, hence there might not necessarily be an open break or cut (hence "no es trencada"). It's essential in such cases for immediate medical assessment and potential intervention
If one of the bone fragments is broken in your nose (intruding and causing a break), you must insert that small piece back into its original position within the nostril ('engualhas aquela fractura dedintz am le tieu dit indic'), taking care to do so as directed. Afterward, it's important for them to return your nose to its normal shape again ("entro que retorne le nas segon la sua figura natural"). This suggests a delicate process possibly requiring skilled intervention and proper alignment in order to restore the appearance of an intact nostril without leaving any noticeable bite marks. It's vital for this procedure, often referred to as repair or setlionation (placing back) by ancient medical practices, be done carefully with And if it is for your ease (to alleviate pain), watch that you do not harm the patient'thy thighs during thy operation on their hernia.
If the fracture is in the upper chest portion of the nose and does not come to that place itself, then cut a piece equal to the extent of the bone where it has broken.
If there is a break in two parts of the body, then perform as if you are performing it (likely referring to applying some form of treatment or mimicry).
And if it is possible to restore the patient' extrication from their pain on the first day of the injury, then otherwise wait for seven or eight days before allowing rest after applying an appropriate periodical remedy (ointment).

Here comes the translation line by line:
If the jawbone is broken into two pieces, then provide extension of parts so that movement may be possible for it to heal.
If you experience discomfort in the teeth leading to breakage (possibly referring to dental issues), tighten those parts from which you hope relief will come through silver or gold filings or ceding; and take pause on the broken jawbone, and on the doubled cloth covering it upwards towards its length where the mandible is located. Place a finger alone along this entire extent of the jaw to avoid further damage while applying (possibly dental work), as long as you do not destroy what's already there.
When commanding the humors (body fluids), ensure rest and calmness, and stop the food from being swallowed by dragon lungs.
If your figure has become distorted due to any manner of illness, then tomorrow you should apply and massage the body part where it was altered; additionally place therein linen cloth soaked in pomade made from honey or album (milk), along with flour paste. Apply these substances gently on your figure for correction.
And when that bandage is applied and adjusted on it, ensuring the bone'setup remains unaltered, thus allowing healing if already injured to be restored strong; this fracture will recover in three simple sessions.

If the fracture is wet mud (i.dict a broken bone soaked in bodily fluids), consider if it's detached from or displaced, then you should adjust those pieces to where they belong within the body for proper healing during that person's recovery period.
If the poultice of the patient is dry, then apply more as needed on the wound according to your need.
When you have removed those satagias (impurities or blockages), and if they are not completely expelled from there, apply warmth using the poultice of earth if it is wide; otherwise, rest on one of the supports that suit this purpose to enable healing.
The given text seems to be from an old medical treatise discussing
When lifting or when a fracture occurs, it is related to the healing process of the sternum (furcula). Here's how we can
When movements are continuous and the chest (where the sternum is located) moves forcefully as in a fight or strenuous activity, it may lead to bending or breaking of the breastbone. This type of breakage can be categorized into one of three ways:
When it is broken, separated, or split into parts that do not adhere together again; and restoration in these fragments is difficult, making the breakage seem as if on land (terrestrial), which requires healing within oneself (internal).
When the operation in that case occurs, when a fracture is set (broken), it requires two ministers: one holding his hand to assist and support the broken sternum, and another extending the colloid (the area around the breastbone) at that location.
And if you are about the bone to set it in those places where its form is according to how covered by flesh or not prominent at all. Do not place too little nor excessive depth into these fractures, as per their natural shape and covering with tissue.
If indigestion persists, cover the abdomen with a cloth or wool quickly according to your need; and raise and contract the chest as much as possible while keeping it within yourself so that you do not spill out what is inside of you.
If you cannot pull the arm bone to the parts outside, through which it has already come down to the sternum, then malaume is raised above the chest and presses on one of its muscles with a large cushion.
E the minister presses on the muscle of him at the joints while the bone of the shoulder blade is raised above its position in his shoulders; and then he corrects the fracture and applies pressure with those bands to it.
If you feel chills in the neck and shoulders, it is time to break them over that area and extract those chills from there easily.
If it is retained in the bone, then you will engineer an incision of yours on one of those instruments that have been applied to this case (the chest bone), and place them where they serve as supports for the sternum; these are made of wood or iron. This refers to creating a surgical cut using tools provided in such cases—these could be wooden or metal implements designed specifically for supporting or manipulating parts like the sternum during an operation. Here, 'retenguda' likely means retained (or fixed), and this seems relevant when discussing fractures ('furcula le sturment').
It seems like the original text is using Old French with influences from Latin and other Romance languages due to its vocabul extrémité médiévale et ses structures syntaxiques légèrement différentes du français moderne standardisé, notamment en raison des termes utilisés pour désigner les humors corporels (lesquels ne correspondaient pas à nos notions modernes de sang, lymphe ou bile). Cependant, I can provide an approximate translation based on the context and available vocab
The length of the operation is as you can possibly manage it; ensure there are both large and small limbs involved in this process at once. (This translation assumes that "extremitatz" refers to parts or appendages, which could be a misunderstanding due to archaic language use.)
If the disruption of the wound where you have inserted pus from within the bone is wide open and bleeding profusely (presumably using "suturing"), adjust your fingers accordingly to perform this delicate task with a needle or stitching tool as required. ("Plagua" may refer here ambiguously either to flesh/skin, wound dressing material like gauze, or perhaps even small leeches used historically for bloodletting; context is key in translation.)
If the rupture is slight, or if you fear an abscess forming, then use small pieces of linen and powder according to the amount of ground flesh breakdown.
If you apply a cauterizing agent (such as vinegar and oil), wrap it in cloth and place it on that area.

During the accidents of cold when it is broken (the heat), there are parts divided and pains intensified here, making labor difficult in this very place, with coughs and chest pain; such conditions are declared within these cracks where the bone has shattered—and they cannot be hidden from consciousness. This line suggests that fractures have significant physical manifestations including intense localized pains which make movements challenging for patients ("labor difficulty"), as well as systemic symptoms like cough and chest pain, emphasizing the severe impact of such injuries on both body movement and general health perception. The reference to "consciousness" implies that these physical signs are readily apparent or cannot be ignored by those affected.
For the restoration of this person's bones when they have been fractured by cold and their thighbones are elevated above them with a pillow; there is an interval placed between the shoulders, using one cover for each limb—this line describes post-injury positioning where support devices such as cushions (referred to here colloquialdictly) or splints ("one covering per arm") are used. The practitioner then takes measures with muscles and back alignment, adjusts the shoulders so that they rest at two levels—this suggests careful manipulation of limb positioning for proper healing orientation along with gentle movements during treatment to suit what is feasible according to patient comfort ("to accordance"). Herein lies a description where both physical support devices (like pillows or splints) and manual techniques are employed, reflective of the therapeutic knowledge at that time regarding bone fractures caused by cold. The final part emphasizes return—the goal is for patients to regain their normal form after healing ("returning shape"), indicating an understanding in medieval medicine not only about immediate care but also recovery and rehabilitation of

Here's a line-by-line breakdown for clarity: When the fluid is applied to each limb and you know whether it will heal or not, then consider that if your hands have already softened and become numb and cannot be moisturized nor stretched anymore—and when those are constricted by tight bands or needles therein holding them, understand that they do not heal, for these conditions lead to mortality in the various diseases.
If those apply and feel pain in them due to tightness or piercing, you will know that the patient' extramedullary joint is saved and humors are healed with medicine.
If you see the likeness of water in the patient's spine and wish to know if it will heal or not, then take into account their weight as well.
When you find that it is already soothed, apply to those who have become affected herein above the knees where they lay down and breath deeply, which will induce urination of their own accord; some may even recline on their backs as a result, understanding fully mortality, hence no longer requiring treatment.
May it not be caused by any of those things; for then its cause is worse and harder (to treat).
E the treatment of it is that you perform self-catheterization with a catheter placed on the spinal disc herniated or eroded, possibly moistened by urine flow from the urethra during straining, and held in place for several hours until the catheter soothes the prolapsed disc.
And when one of the cushions providing comfort and existing, rests upon that limb where pain resides due to torture; command the humors (or fluids) not to take a break or sleep on the part causing suffering so it may heal.
If you feel the grinding of bones or any cause that has already separated from them, then rest on the spine and press upon that bone; adjust the lips of your tools if it' extruded greatly; apply care to that part covered by skin, so long as healed.
May your bone be broken at the hip joints and it is the end of life's thread; when you insert your hand into its left side below in that which remains after death (presumably referring to medical treatment postmortem), pause over there with plaster or sponge, if indigestion arises from these interventions, apply firm pressure.
If you feel cracked pieces in the body, touch that area and stabilize it, doing so as part of healing what has already been done to become healthy again.

The bones of the arches are broken or cracked (implying that they may have sustained such injuries), and if so, their breakage is simply communication at those extremities; located in length as well as declination to joints—herein pain manifests itself both where it was fractured and through a puncture. The splint (cane) becomes stunned when the bone breaks there [Note: This translation attempts to convey that if an arch or other body part is broken, one can feel this not only at distant extremities but also in localized pain upon examination/puncturing; and it suggests a reaction whereby medical staff may experience shock (fascinated) when they see the breakage of bones].
The restoration of it is that you stretch your hand over where there'thy a fracture, which forms the figure of thee.
If the bone is broken in just one limb of yours, then immediately you should fasten that part which has been bound with leather using an apparatus until it returns to its normal shape.
May it be that the fracture is in the long bone or already declining to parts, then you should speak with the malady within your belly until such time as preparations for mending this fracture are made by you. And when you have applied the plaster to that area, pause on this beam or bone piece, and stretch tightly over the place where there is no fear of a chiseling wound penetration nor removal of the spine.

The translation of this line is: "Follow the hump along a section; and with your uninjured arm, reach out over where it comes into contact at that spot under which its rod bends." Here, 'sezela' refers to an instrument or perhaps part thereof being manipulated for healing purposes.

And only when either the great fire or small has been broken and their pieces have come together, so it is said that they break apart accidentally.
When the small fire below (probably referring to a candle or similar source of heat), its restoration is light and healing for them; therefore, their recovery will be also quickened.
When the fire of it breaks down long enough for its bone is broken, and healing becomes difficult.
When that putrefied matter from it arrives when two bones are broken,
So if the bone that is fractured is the small one above (likely referring to a specific part of the skull or spine), it is convenient for the doctor, and you must restore it quickly so that while doing this healing process, his head can be kept comfortable.
May it be that when a great fire is what you seek (to heat or treat), once applied the forceful extension has ceased.
If the two fires are combined together in ignition, then you should stop their withdrawal forcefully.

In this line, it appears that the term "restauracio" refers to a treatment or repair process for an injury involving the hip bone (coxa). However,
The hip bone (cuisse) is broken and has been declared to have fallen apart as time passes, indicating urgency for proper treatment or repair ("convertit en mort"). This line suggests that the injury to the patient's hip bone may be worsening over time due to neglect. The use of poetic language emphasizes the gravity of a poorly managed fracture and possibly its impact on both mobility (indicated by
In this line, it appears that the mention of "liement" refers to a form of binding or immobilization device used in medieval medicine for treating broken bones like fractures (fractura). The goal is to stabilize and securely hold together ("strenhut") not just at the site where the break occurred, but also with additional means as needed. This method likely involved various types of materials or implements fashioned into braces that would be applied directly over "the fracture." These supports are designed so tightly they press against and secure to both sides (

Here the mention of "razitz" implies some form of external intervention or surgical procedure that may be required for a hip bone (cueyssa) injury ("lahoras sia propda al denolh"). It describes how, during such an operation ('denolyng'), one might use additional supports—possibly splints made with liament material. These external devices would help maintain the injured area's shape and alignment while internal healing takes place (described as "la fractura," which is Spanish for 'fracture'). The phrase indicates that these tools are not only crucial but also strategically applied to both imm
If the injury is due to excessive cold, then it will cause pain in various parts of the body immediately; and such tendons should be tightened with wax (or similar substance) on demand as needed for healing purposes only.
Here the doctor gently restrains the limbs until he reduces that second into its natural similarity and joints are reconnected properly through good union; provided you do not painlessly immobilize a contracted part of the body. If you have an ulcer in the wound, then leave that area for several days until the sore heals itself and return to your care afterwards.
The strictness of the limb is pain: it wraps around the fracture with a hard bandage, folded twice or thrice, and reduces excess; furthermore, wrap again within so that reaches down to the ankle and knee joints where their tendons are located.
Here the long linen is introduced between the thigh and the specific portion of the dress as needed at each division, and their extremities are brought close to this part where excess fabric from the bandage remains; they rotate over the thigh and the waistband accordingly.
And apply pressure on that wound's location and place some of the stones from there above the bone in the groin area where it is broken.
Return and fill the emptiness between the sheet and the thighs with heavy clothes to ensure that bleeding is stopped (coagulation).

May joint locking and nodules be recent occurrences; if they are encysted in the water vessel where their thighs reside (which may have been softened by herbs, high alkali, razor blades), accompanied with honey and spirits similar to these substances—then apply plaster on top of it for mollification, using diallagium as sweet medicine; or if a mucolagin derived from the ashes of alkaline wood (and oil/fats extracted by pressing sesame seeds) is present along with linseed grease prepared in women's breasts—then apply this on top for mollification, these being remedies named after Grecian consolidation.

Dislocation is an injury to any of the joints in one's body that prevents movement and necessitates attention from a medical professional; it brings on significant pain and swelling into the groin area (malu).
So when you bend down to adjust a dislocation, forcefully straighten it out immediately and not delay; if there is any delay, the joint becomes arthritic making reduction difficult again.
For so that there is not gout or prolapse in the hour of application, frequent movements bring about cramps and pains.
When you pour vinegar (or acid), cover yourself with the flaubotomy of the thighs and wait until the inflammation subsides; then bind your limb to watercress stalks and oil, for ease in reduction.
Every part of it will be cured by the water from which its memory returns in that place.
And when the displacement of joints follows after a break, it enters from one side into the other side.

Of treatment for jaw dislocation if not set; and temporarily fractured joints can be managed by: either they are slightly realigned at their location with minimal effort, or the entire displacement is rectified within which saliva from the mouth (malaxus) must prevent that tooth/teeth cannot remain in place nor close one's mouth properly; and patient’thy tongue wrapped around his word.

Regarding the reduction of a shoulder dislocation and injury to the arm' extrinsic muscles:
The fur finally is not dislocated from the loins due to its continued position on the body; and some times it becomes dislocated at the lower region, which is declared by feeling.
The restoration of him is that the malady ascends his two legs and extends his arms. Return (or apply) pressure at that location with your hand or firmly pressed part of it; she/he will return there again.
Return your pause (holding pressure) over that plaster and crushed stones/ashes, which are very hard.
May the extremity of that person who sits on their hips remain in place today, not dislocated at any time; if it is reduced and manipulated as we have explained and according to what you are equipped for handling.
Here the pressure is applied to that dressing, and with pills, extraction, command the humors (or fluids) to settle down and rest within until it heals.
At this moment of caregiving, reduction is achieved in the patient' extramuscular part when it is separated from its place.
The provided text appears to be from an old medical treatise discussing symptoms
When it comes to the reduction of a muscle strain, here is what might generally follow based on typical medieval or archaic language patterns combined with an
It is known that the muscle has not become dislocated but according to three methods; one of these involves moving it back towards its original position quickly, possibly indicating immediate action or swift repositioning as recommended by medical practitioners at the time who would understand this formulation in their own lexicon.
The second method involves moving the displaced portion of the muscle away from where it has become misaligned, and this requires force without causing further issues at either end near the shoulder or in relation to nerves—this hints at a nuanced approach considering anatomical relationships crucial for safe treatment. It's essential during these procedures not only to address the immediate concern but also safeguard against additional complications that could arise from misapplication of force, reflecting medieval medicine’s attention even then to holistic care and avoidance of further harm.
Mostly it is a displacement and departure of the body'sflesh from its place, mainly in those parts where fleshes are thin, dislocation occurs; perhaps also when there are movements of bones, illness goes out with difficulty.
When the limb is touched lightly or palpated with a hammer, and its muscles are fixed by applied pressure due to previous displacement, this suggests joint inflammation which needs medical attention.
Now when you cry out that you are overbearing and heavy upon me (the physician), then proceed with the healing of me.
Here comes the first source sentence translated line by line into English:
If it is displaced from its position or joints and you must apply touch treatment without fear of causing harm:
From this dislocation it is said that a light reduction occurs when it becomes cold and descends into the abdomen.
The reduction of the patient is for the minister to lift their body up into parts above it and pause with tightly pressed hands on its surface until they return there, lifting the part back up again; afterward pausing a little while before returning them gently.
May if for water returns not and from the consumption that dislocation occurs, hurry to bathe the malady in tailwater (i.dict "tailwater" as a type of natural spring or running water), where it is administered with bonebroth meant to soften joints and liniments composed of fenugreek, mustard seed, honey, applied along with its high-altitude crustacean shell fragments (interpreted herein possibly referring to seafood).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to proceed with this treatment: make present a long home that is from the waist and belonging to it; immediately insert your muscle into the groove of the waist, lifting upwards while keeping inserted in place until the hernia hangs suspended in air, another servant pulls out the mass (likely referring to protruded intestine) from inside just below its belly. If the lumbago is loose, then it should be observed that another cause has caused its suspension; when this happens, it will return violently in such a way.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another method of reduction is as follows: a long staff with its head remains on the ground; similar to a mortar' extrusion which should not be thick nor subtle, and it is positioned downstairs near the patient’s buttocks quickly. The spinal column rests upon this stick atop the bedclothes, while the hernia lies along the length of the staff; concurrently extend your arm from that other part for strengthening purposes, so that when these forces come together swiftly, it returns to its proper place promptly.
If reduction of it is difficult for all the reasons mentioned above, then use this treatment: grasp a quantity with which its length reaches two arm' extranches (the extremities), and rotate that amount along its axis by four degrees as follows:
Even over his head place linen wraps for that sword does not pierce through the hollow (of the body).
Return the chest pillow to its place within the parts immediately and extend your arm over it; hold the staff above you along with the arms of both servants (likely referring to medical attendants or aids), as well as the extension of one's own limbs.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When the body's interior is completed according to any possible way you can do it; and when you pause occasionally for your patient's sinewy spirit of wool which quantity needs preparation with powdered moly from mines or eggshell, apply this plaster prepared on muscles in order that they may be turned upwards above the constriction point; then twist the ligament over the poultice and attach your patient'thy arm to their collarbone so it is secured. Let nothing come out of its socket for seven days without a sound, hoarse voice appearing.
When food consumed from sickness is sparingly provided and the body feels relief, then place it for healing on you.
Return food that has been given in greater amounts and engage it in some sort of motion; therefore, if it is closed off and not softened, then already healing occurs.
If the joint is dislocated due to humidity that you have caused or for another reason, then in that case administer three kinds of cautery as taught in the school of cauterization.
If all of this pain is present and the ligament and joint are not closed for seven days after being sutured (stitched), then they will reduce swelling over time, but it cannot be fixed nor raised above these parts; you understand that these bones belong to the upper part of the muscle or its extension/smoothing out.
From the dislocation of that which is felt in the chest and thighs or lower parts, reduction is done by pushing and extension until return (back to normal position).
When it is administered in that place, and heals within which it was applied,
If you worsen the state of gravity in the limb and slow down its movement, then let that gravity be relieved until it returns to its original natural condition.

For the care of hip dislocation, it would translate to: "About the treatment for the dislocation of the hip." In this line
You understand that the hip joint is difficult and appears dislocated; it's usually displaced in all directions but mostly between the parts forward (anteriorly) and backward (posteriorly), meaning when you adjust a previously dislocated hips, at this moment your declaration becomes manifest. For now, its angle curves downwards such that one cannot bend their arms or touch it with those hands; as for the joint itself is concave – here's evidence of displacement which indicates how to proceed in treatment:
When you have the coxae (hips), reduce their dislocation to such an extent that they return to normal position; if there is a fracture lithotomy in place as well, it' extrication will be difficult and unlikely for complete recovery regardless – especially when present at other parts of the body where sprains occur with greater intensity, accompanied by frequent movements towards said location leading potentially toward death.
When the restoration is possible, it means that the leg must be extended as far as possible and the arms expanded; have yourselves on the hips and thighs of the patient, pushing at their joint where they hold onto themselves or with the palm's base inside to return them back.
May it be that if the dislocation is in the joints ahead of time (presently), then return to where they are twisted back together when pressed upon by your hand inside, while you touch their wrist on the spot where bone meets skin.
If sprain does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and strong movement.
When two ministers stretch out their arms and hold that instrument between them, thus preventing its excessive extension.
And return his arm completely turned around (revolved), placing it under the patient' extraneous covering or lariat for support and protection.
When the doctor touches the joint, apply some oil to it so that those causes which help in its lubrication are alleviated, and then gently massage the joint until it returns to normal function;
Here comes the sentence to translate: Apply the reduction of him that is paused upon that paste in which his fixity and discharge are made with albumen's substance, and its distention attenuated by means of strictures descending from the collarbone, suspended arm resting on acute points.
Return it is placed back; and so if the joint forms in its place, then you should return that ligament to it and fixate it therewith.
If you see the joint not strained, then apply the plaster and bandage repeatedly for several days until it is externalized; after that, return that as well.
If you apply pressure to the reduction of the joint, its position is in motion, and administer moist dressing with warmth gently applied internally until it has subsided; where there's a hernia at the fatty mass movement site, tie it up securely here. Apply this treatment above the joint during daytime and nighttime. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Intramedical bath enters where there is moisture (or fluid).
If you wish to pause over that wet and split cow hole at the border, press firmly on it for some time; this will dry out and return to its proper disposition.
Given that "Capitol" does not provide text for translation but appears as a
In the treatment of hernia protrusion, it is at the joint between the arm and body where care should be focused. (This translation assumes that "Capitol" refers to a specific medical topic or context related to this discussion.) Here's an attempt based on Latin-der
For a protruded abdomen (or what is referred to as "malassen"), the reduction of displacement involves joints elsewhere—it might occur at an articulation or may result in apatheism, necessitating immediate local application with heat treatment ("local applications"). The urgency for reducing it when protrusion occurs implies that prompt action should be taken where possible to reestablish the proper position. (This translation is formulated on understanding "malassen" as a term used within this context related to hernia and assuming 'alcunas vetz' refers to multiple joints or sites, while also translating medical terminology.) Here are more interpretations:
The reduction of the dislocation is that you stop the joint'supremaunite (groin) above a table and extend it from there; let the doctor or their hand rest upon the impending juncture, and push it back to its place.
Even if it is considered that the palm has remained on the stomach of her/him, then make sure to position their hips over a table for extension and reduction; if dislocation precedes this must be placed in such way backward relative to them so as metaphorical hand (doctor) can rest above potential joint connection.
So then if it returns soon, good things follow; but if not, that which is strong will soften the ulcer and prevent its treatment from continuing here for several days.
May the joint according to its twisted nature; and not in vain does it heal, for its own cause is softened and cannot be stretched further—know that the nerves are either compressed or strained, and only when you apply force with cautery will you provide a reason (cause) for this fluid.
So when they retire (return), place your hand on the one that has been recommended for them, and rest their body upon it for days; then cut off and also exercise both parts of what is placed thereon, as well as the belly'seat whereof you hold hands.
May it be that if the patient' extricates and experiences any form of pressure or gravity in there, then apply some water to his tail region and cold compresses for several paces, until he is relieved.
Capitol XXIX.
Of the treatment of joint displacement.
Some days they are displaced throughout the entire body.
When a part of the body is dislocated at either their hands or abdomen, tighten and push it back into place until they return to normal.
Place support under the head of this person, and suspend that portion which has been dislocated, allowing it to rest for two days.

When any of the vertebrae in the back or neck becomes dislocated completely, and localized movement occurs therein which is not treated, then death approaches as it enters into a state related to ill humor (malignum humorum). Here "ill humor" likely refers to an imbalance among bodily fluids believed by medieval physicians to affect health. The phrase translates the concern for timely and appropriate medical intervention in cases of severe spinal dislocation, underscoring its potentially fatal consequences without proper care according to historical perspects on medicine related with humoral theory—a prevalent notion during
When such an evil humor (ill-humor) is excreted from the body on its own accord and cannot be retained, it moves or flows along to various limbs of oneself or others' legs with cushions under them; another may move a spinal vertebra here, which then also has movement in parts as well as potential for curative treatment. Here "evil humor" refers again to the imbalance among bodily fluids that was thought by medieval physicians to impact health negatively.
Thus it is swolthy behind and has no yellow discharge.
May the cure for them be that you will consider if their yellowish dyspepsia is not a cure or healing of all things therein; in which case, it shall neither become a remedy nor restore health entirely.
May enter through castration or percussion/palpation to these areas; they return the ancient ways of treatment discussed in a detailed speech, which may include extracting and preparing various instruments from this for their demonstration today.
From that one is not cured but only healed by what you have applied directly on their two places appropriately with the liquid that I recommend.
It is that the humidity (or excess fluid) extends over their face and cheek down from above of bone/skin surface, and it spreads quickly through limb joints to avoid being visible on their chest skin.
And place one stake upright on the ground at the end of the patient's leg beyond their head, and another in a vise holding up the legs elsewhere, preventing them from moving too much.
The minister holds the staff and does not leave it in the pit; another minister takes that form with their stick as well.
Here comes the translation line by line:
Here the minister extends the ligature to the part of the beam, ensuring that neither beams nor their respective fixtures are left loosely attached; yet not as tightly bound as we have previously mentioned.
The doctor places their hands on the spinal vertebra that returns strength, and adjusts them over thereon plateau until they return too, whereupon he/she will make appropriate corrections to maintain balance or posture.
If it does not return through this method, then take a table of which the length or width is three feet, and dig into the wall where we have previously stated that the hernia should be located within its limit at the extreme point of the table. Here is the line by line translation:
If you wish to turn the area that has been revolved above, then remain on your back with the head of the malady at the end of the two staves; these poles are as long as an arm, and where they meet is a palm'dictum - it has already become troubled in some of the staves where movement occurs, each one firmly fixed to earth so that no further spreading can occur.
And if you have a staff in which it is turned (presumably for some therape extraneous rite or treatment), then rotate the same within the two halves of both staves.
In the limb there is a defect where it forms its staff (referring to some kind of medical apparatus or structure within), whose length is equivalent to that which has been rotated, and in the other two staves they seem similar to this one.
Return the sinew you have cut in the groin of the patient where he must lie on it (the area), and the sinews you've cut into the thighs when turning him over, which is necessary for supporting his legs.
And for each turn and position that you need, apply one servant who tightens the turn at its place; have the doctor manipulate the spine as we've discussed.
Then place a bandage on the location where it'thy backbone has been positioned correctly; after applying wax-coated dressings around and over this area as directed by pages three or four of these instructions—these represent its length, enough to press into the affected space left dry from gelation. And above the spinal column lies my placement on it.
And restore its ligaments as mentioned beforehand, and place it under the nourishment humors within so that it heals.
If there is any imminent threat at the site of healing, then it is recommended that medicines be used to moisten and cleanse the treatment table for a long time, which we have been advised; and already has been applied a layer of lead in this place.

For the treatment of a dislocated hip, historically one might refer to:
You understand that the joint between the wide and the muscle does not necessarily entail dislocation only once or twice; do not harden these places where you have already caused pain in other smaller body parts with concave shapes, just as when they are made sensitive by your treatment.
E the joint of the large is dislocated according to four movements, it may be dislocated at the parts located inside, or outside, or forward, or backward, or behind.
Mostly are dislocated at joints of limbs and rarely at parts ahead or behind the joints.
When the dislocation of his limb is found at the joints it becomes long and hard due to inflammation that was placed there from healthiness, making him unable to bend their knee with their tongue as they attempt an apostematic incision for cauterization so that the head of the thigh can come here.
And because that which has caused his displacement is located outside of him, the accidents or injuries are contrary to this injury.
When the patient's limb is dislocated further down due to pressure from below (the cushion), it does not necessarily double their current pain in that area; if progression occurs and they are unable to move above, urine retention happens inside them, and a pad must be placed on their foot over the heel.
E the name of that person to whom dislocation occurs behind is such that it cannot expand the joint or bend which has already been bent out of its position; thus placed cushion under them, and another on their legs/chest holding hands tightly in place preventing further displacement.
May the reduction of these spices in this dislocation is what you consider, and as long as the dislocation is old and ancient, already treated with the reductions that you administer here today according to its disposition; consequently, there'thy no need for further prognostication.
In which the dislocation is recent and one of the four types of dislocation, then turn that to water (meaning you should immobilize it with a wet limp), extend that joint both upwards towards the upper parts of the body and downwards towards the lower parts, and apply pressure symmetrically on the right and left side. Once applied, this method returns strength without need for other treatments.
May it be that if the patient does not return in this manner during treatment: then have those preparing for you present a strong and extend the cushion from under their parted legs placed here (with time intervals or immediately), holding onto other necessary instruments, also to spread out the ma of what is above them on each leg timely; while another assists by stretching this upward element with careful timing so hands are held.
And if there is an extension out of the loin or from one side of the chest to another side of the chest (implying possible swelling due to fluid accumulation), it should be managed accordingly:
And if all of them are extended during a fever until the humoral sickness is lifted and begins to descend into its place on the earth, so that it no longer protrudes downwardly.
This particular form of extension occurs in all four (it refers to joints).
And if the dislocation returns due to water (humors) that we have mentioned, then it is necessary for all special waters (remedies or treatments specific to this patient' extraneous matter).
In the patient's own reduction, when it is dislocated, and the displacement occurs at joint parts, so that the hernia rises onto its back side; and place breaks in the thigh area where between the head of the hip bone and the location where one lies on their leg, holding their hands.
And another minister with strong breath blows the limbs of him/her backward significantly, so that it returns to its own place.
This particular substance is a curative for which this limb has been reduced, compared to other substances.
May it be excused on you and not obeyed to this specific type of treatment for all, wherein two pills from the patient'seems are bound together with thread strong as ligature (ligament), above both legs bones and below both leg veins.
Whenever any part of his body corresponds in length to four digits and the thigh extends as far as two digits, then such is considered normal for that person.
And position the patient's waist on the top of the chair, so that it is in a comfortable manner, and its length from head to toe corresponds approximately to two cubits (a measure roughly equivalent to about 18 inches or half a meter).
Here comes the sentence to translate: E propone a a young man strong that he reduces the head of the thigh, and it is suspended by another young man; likewise, another youth removes the thigh at its strength return to place, whereby quickly returns the juncture.
In the reduction itself, when it dislocates from the part removed, the hernia presses on the thigh according to how we have previously prepared in the groin; and its sling rests directly over the affected area of the hernia and chest.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Every minister extends to its respective area, and the doctor holds their instrument according to art.
When dislocation occurs in the limbs below, then it is necessary to stretch out and hold one hand over each thigh of the patient; this course tells us what must be done: with your right palm placed on top of the leg'thyroid (possibly referring to a body part related to movement or support), you apply pressure here as well.
If the dislocation is at the joints behind, do not cover up until the groin extends to the parts in front of it; those who have covered will be present when his ankle becomes dislocated from these points forward, as we mentioned earlier about his face and ligaments being extended. There'thy no harm (no guayre).
When compression is applied with a tabletop over the location where joint pain occurs,
So that the reduction is complete as I cover it—and the term for 'reduction' in this context does not concern you, and from your thighs place cushions on them; when you again manipulate those joints and extend the swolthy flesh outside of the bandage, you realize which part covered by that has returned to its cavity. At that point, adjust hinges and padding in between compressures so as not for thickness at any portion should become engorged—and secure it with a belt or girdle tightly attached around; fix this restraint on the body for three days or four.
Return the sinew and ligaments, and compare one cushion with another.
When you see those twisted in yourself, you understand that the dislocation is already closed, and so let the humors flow out of it.
If you see any cause of suppuration (infection), then return and apply that dressing as per your first application technique, and leave it on for three days.
