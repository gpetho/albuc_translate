Oh, sons, since you have completed this book, which is the last part of the science of medicine, for its completion and its consequences in it, and for its explanations and declarations, it seems to me that you will complete what I have written in this treatise, which is a part of my operation with my hand, so it is surgery.
Because the operation with my hand is spread throughout our region and in our time of total privacy, until it has fortified the science of it, and its vision has been stopped; and I do not remain silent about it except for some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which muddy the waters and lead to those errors and hesitations until the intentions of it are closed and its force is elongated.
And it seems to me that you will vivify this ordering of this treatise in the second way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and so that you may come to the forms of the instruments of cautery and of other tools of the work as it is for addition to the declaration, and for preparation of it, which cause is necessary.
The reason why no artificial hand is found in this our time, is that the art of medicine is long, and it covers the skillful actor who has been exercised in the science of anatomy which Galen understood until he knew the juices of the members and their forms, and the conjunction and separation of them; and had knowledge of the bones, nerves and ligaments, and their number, and their position; and of the pulsating veins and quiet ones, and of the places of their sensation.
And for this Hippocrates said that a name is not enough, but rather in the small work, and more in the art of the hand.
We have already said that in the introduction of this book; because whoever does not know what we have said about anatomy, is not exempt from falling into error, for which many men die, thus you have seen many of them, because they are formed in this science and get away from it, and its experiments.
Because you have seen a foolish doctor who has attempted to incise an scrophilous aposteme on the neck of a woman, and has cut some arteries of the neck so that great blood flowed until the woman almost died in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who promised that he would remove a stone from a man's bladder which had progressed to his state, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone in a piece of the bladder, so that the man died on the third day.
And you have already called it a futile effort to extract that, and I saw that because of the greatness of the stone and because of the disposition of the patient's body, I knew that he would die under my hands.
And I saw another doctor who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and he made a bad incision on the patient's leg which was broken in his thigh; and because of the doctor's ignorance, he extracted the fracture, above the wound, with pincers and tongs, with strong traction, and did not leave the wound to heal.
And then I dislocated the joint according to their desires, and then I relaxed it, and then I left it for several days and commanded that they should not move the limb; and it was thus until the thigh and foot were apostematous, and I came to a loss.
And you have already called it a futile effort to him, and I had dislocated the limb, and consequently it was tranquilized and thus relieved of its pains.
But the corruption was confirmed in the limb, so that it could not be restrained, and it did not cease to spread the corruption in the limb until the patient's condition worsened.
And I saw another doctor who perforated a cancerous aposteme, and it became ulcerated after several days, until the evil of it was magnified in his lord's sight.
The reason is that the cancerous aposteme was pure of melancholic humor, and then it did not cover how it would come to him in entirety, but rather it was a member which suffered from everything, as if it had been besieged.
And for this, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation with my hand be divided into two devotions: one is an operation associated with health, and another is a work in which there is danger in major dispositions.
And you have already existed everywhere in this book where I found operating in which there is error and fear; because it is necessary for you to watch over this and leave that, so that the fools do not find a way to speak and deceive you.
And then take up your arms in solicitude and protection of God, and your evils are fallen and are confirmed.
And use the best way for the grace of God to lose salvation and laudable success, and leave the terrible evils of difficult healing, and stop using your arms of that which makes you fear, so that it is established in your faith and in your name you are not evasive: because more remains of your glory, and afterwards in the world and lastly in your sanctities.
Some people daily drink from certain sacred springs: "There is no bad medicine for a bad patient, because bad doctors are not named."
"And I have devoted this book to three chapters."
"Here begins the division of the book, and first of the first part." "The first chapter deals with the head and feet, in the forms of instruments and in the furnishings of cauteries, and what is necessary for the operation."
"The division of the second part." "The second chapter, on scarification and perforation, and on cupping glasses, and on plasters, and on the extraction of arrowheads and on similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of instruments."
"The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on the cure of twisting and on similar things; a chapter ordered from head to feet, and according to the forms of instruments."
"I have described the quality of the juices of that cautery and its instruments, and in what complexions it is prohibited to use cauteries."
"Therefore I say that the sermon on the quality of the juice of cauteries and its instruments is a long and prolix sermon, subtle for science, and secretly hidden; and already many wise men have spoken about it, and they are discordant, and to me it seems sufficient to take a small part of their sermons, fearing prolongation."
"Therefore I say that cauteries conform universally to all complexions, which is a matter or several matters, except for two complexions, which are cold complexions without matter."
"In the cold and dry complexions there is a disagreement; for some said that cauteries are useful for those, and others said the contrary, that cauteries are not convenient in illnesses which are by quality and by dryness, because the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that cold and dry illnesses are healed by cauteries which are hot and dry."
"And I say to him who says the contrary, that by cauteries it is made a remedy in all cold and dry illnesses that are found in men's bodies, because when you compare men's bodies with their humidity to the complexion of fire, you find that men's bodies are cold."
"And I say by the sermon of that, that experience has already taught me many times to discover."
"Moreover, I do not think that it is necessary to speak about that which has already been experimented and exercised in the chapter on cauteries by last exercise, and to know the diversity of complexions in men's bodies and the disposition of illnesses in their metesises, and the causes of those, and the accidents of those, and the space of time for those."
"Moreover, in the other complexions, it is not about your fear, and especially in cold and humid illnesses, because all doctors have agreed on those, and they do not disagree on the remedy with cauteries in those."
"And know, sons, that the secret of cure by cauteries is fire and its goodness, so concerning cauteries as a burning medicine, it is because fire is simple, the action of which does not penetrate except to the member which is cauterized and does not reach another member unless it is adjusted with a small benefit."
"Moreover, the action of burning medicine penetrates to that in the members where it is needed, and makes them come to the ailing member with difficult healing and makes them hear."
"Moreover, fire, by its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do anything except to overflow; and it is already known to us through experiment and long service of study in the art about the truth of causes; and for that I have been excused from the length of the sermon; and if it were not that I did not leave my book open in this passage to you, secretly hidden with fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and of the expulsion through which it expels illnesses, a philosophical sermon demonstrated, which would be acute in your feet."
"And know, sons, that they disagree on the time at which it is convenient to use cauteries and pause at the best time of spring."
"And I say that cauteries are convenient at all times, because the harm from the accidental time is submerged in the remedy of that which has been attracted by cauteries, and especially if cauteries are for pains or necessary pains, strong and steadfast, which do not suffer tardiness because they fear those that bring evil, which is greater than small harm entering through time."
"And thus you do not catch in your feet, or, sons, that which they do not esteem except the common people and foolish doctors, so it is that at that illness which is healed by cauteries, it is not returned to all time, and pauses at that consequence."
And the cause is not so much in the skin as in the cold humors that alter the complexion and dry out the humidity which is the cause of the pains.
Perhaps emperor's cauteries are excessive in medicine, to show off the value and truth of their operation and greatness of his noble lord.
And it is possible that his malady returns at some hour of time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his malady, and the truth of it, and what is prepared in the course of his body by the aggregation of excessive heat in him, and what has come to him through his acquisition of vices and similarities to those causes; but that the malady in which cauteries are administered is a subtle malady in a member with few excessive heat and humidity, thus as cauteries of teeth for pain and similarity to that, it is possible that in him there will not return that pain, but rather it will be made small.
And it is a common saying that cauteries are the last resort of medicine, and it is a desperate remedy, not because they understand it in him, for they believe that it is not a cure that profits from medicine nor another cause that profits from cauteries.
And the cause is in contrast to that; and the intention that cauteries are the last resort of medicine is not but when we administer many ways of cure in certain maladies, and those medicines do not confer, and then at the end of the cause, one administers thus cauteries, and profits from that. And henceforth I reject the idea that cauteries are the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and foolish doctors understand.
And they said that gold cauteries are better than iron cauteries, and they didn't say this except for the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance.
And they said that the place of cauteries does not make a breach, as if it is not absolutely true, because you already have it and have experienced that it does not do this except in certain bodies, and cauteries are good and better than iron, just as they said; but when you make cauteries with a focus of gold, it is not for you to declare, because it is ignited according to the quantity that you want for the rigor of the gold, and prepares to receive heat; and if you adjust on the ignition it makes the gold flow into the focus, and sometimes in the focus certain layers so that the artisan can take advantage of it.
And therefore it is done to make iron cauteries, we must push lightly and more profoundly into the right direction of operation.
And now I have ordered this chapter on cauteries according to chapters, and I have ordered those of the head within the feet, so that the demanding one knows what he wants from it.
The first chapter.
This cautery confers on the humidity and coldness about the sudden accident of which there are two causes, so it is a cause of swelling and multiple fluxes of rheumatic flow, called corissa, from the head to the parts of the veins and ears fluent, and multiple sleeping, and of toothache and gout, and universally of all maladies that come from coldness, thus as paralytic, swooning, and apoplexy, and similarly in those maladies.
The form of this cautery is this, that primarily it commands the patient to be evacuated from medicine by a mild evacuating remedy for three or four nights, according to the truth of the patient's virtue and his age and his custom.
And then it commands him to shave his head with a razor, and then to sit between his thighs on a heated bench and place his hands over his own feet.
And then he places the razor in the palm of his hand, then puts it on the razor's edge between the nostrils of his nose. Perhaps emperor, as the finger of my middle finger has arrived, it signs that place with tension, and then ignites the olive oil cautery of which this is the form.
And then he places it on the tender spot with tension, in a manner that descends, in which the finger of my hand is constricted little by little, and you revolve it.
And then he lifts his hand lightly and regards the spot, and if you see already some quantity of head being discovered, thus as the quantity of grain of errors, then he lifts his hand, and if it does not return to that iron, another of that, if it is frozen, until it is seen by him what I have said to you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the spot and leave it there for three days.
And then place it on the wrapped cloth in a bundle and leave it there until the scar of the focus is destroyed. And then heal the spot with four-part medication until it is healthy.
And they said that when the Roman plague was lifted, so much better did I get the arm, because it is better and more jovial.
They should burn some of those that are to be cauterized on the outside of the bone, and hold the cautery so that it is adhered to some part of the bone's specificity.
And then return it to its adjustment on the bone, and then it will be cured.
They should burn others with the cautery penetrating deeply, so that it enters the bone strongly and grips the bone firmly, and this is the method of small alleviations. They esteem that from that place issue the vapors of the head.
And it will be held in the open wound for a long time, and then it will be cured until it is consolidated.
But I have not seen these two special kinds of cauteries at all, unless in some homes according to the way of fear; and thus, you see, my better health is due to salvation, when it is; because the head is revealed by solution of continuity with the aforementioned, as we have testified in the other members, and especially since the head of the patient is of frail nature.
And the species of cauteries first mentioned is most safe and better for me; and from that house and in that work I am healthy.
It follows accordingly.
About the cautery of the head.
When the whole head is affected by chronic and long pain and it is in prolonged illness, and uses remedies of poultices and of bandages and of cupping glasses and of emplasters and of ointments and of catheters and of gauzes, and especially if it has been cauterized with a cautery that recounts and does not provide relief from any of those causes, then consider that the head of the patient is of strong creation in its nature; and it is not frail and troubled by great cold, then that cauterying with another cautery below that one is insufficient. And then cauteries that one on the horn of the seven-headed beast with a cautery until the bone is divided. Cut the bone and uncover the part of the bone that we have recounted and cauteries that with a cautery at the back part of the head in the place called "vas" — and it is that place where the windy pause is made. And lift your hand in that way, and do not uncover the bone, because the patient will suffer great diverse pain from the pain of all the other cauteries of the head.
And you will direct this cautery to its place, because it is necessary that the cautery which is being used to cauteries the horns of the head and the occiput is more subtly applied than that which is cauterized in the middle place of the head; and this is the method of it.
Chapter three.
On the cautery of non-ancient migration.
When there is pain in the head's part, or it is extended pain to the eye, it should be evacuated with medicines that mondiginate the head, and another cure should be administered, which you have mentioned in the treatises on illnesses; and if nothing helps, then cauterying is done in two ways: either cauterying with acute burning medicine, or with iron.
The cauterying with acute burning medicine is that you take a handful of salt, and scrape it off and bind the extremities of it to both heads. And then incise the place of pain in the temple with a sharp lancet until it reaches the hidden bone, until it is concealed.
And then strengthen it over the place where it is stopped by constant constriction, and thus leave it for three hours; and then remove it and extract the salt, and leave the wound open for two or three days, and then pause on the submerged edge in a bandage until the place forms a crust.
And then cure that one with an ointment until it is healed.
And if you see, do as I have written about some burning medicines which I have described in the second treatise on burning medicines.
The cauterying with iron is done according to this method: ignite the iron for cauterying, of which this is the form.
and it is called "claus clavilhs", because the head of it is thus like a form of nail in which there is some curvature, and in the middle place of it there is a small prominence.
And then pause on the place of pain, and hold your hand — so that the acidity which is beneath is not adhered — and turn the small iron slowly with velocity.
And if the quantity of it that is adhered to the specificity of the bone thus as its magnitude, and lift your hand so that the artery is not adhered to the one beneath, so that there is no flow of blood.
And then dip the edge in salt water and pause it on the place, and leave it for three days; and then pause the edge much in a bandage, and then cure it with an ointment until it is healed.
And if you see, cautery the extremity of the cutter according to the cautery, and beware of incision of the artery in this non-ancient migration properly.
Fourth chapter.
On the cautery of ancient migratory diseases.
When you treat migratory diseases in the way that we have spoken of previous treatments, and in the divisions of the illnesses, and do not hasten the treatment, and sometimes due to the illness that does not allow for what we have said about the first cautery in medicine or in fire cautery, then it is necessary that you ignite the cuticular cautery until it is whitened, because it signifies on the line of long duration of the same magnitude, or that which; and pause your hand for a while and strengthen it until you incise the artery and penetrate into the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuity of the jawbone, which is weakened by chewing, and that the ligament is not injured and the nerves are not damaged in such a way, and that there is no spasmodic contractions.
And if it is about the custody and caution of the flow of blood in the artery that is constricted, because in the constriction of it there is fear, and greater harm to him who ignores what he does and is not skilled and experienced; and thus the operation begins with him at the beginning.
And I will find a remedy in the memory of the regulation of blood flow accidents in the artery, according to the usual method, in the same place of this book.
And if you see that this disease does not respond to this cautery and the body of the patient is tolerable, then cautery it in the same place on the head as we have recounted, and cure the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have said in the chapter on stretching of arteries with cautery having two handles, and it is a better cautery for this and more convenient.
Chapter five.
On the cautery of ear pains.
When in the ear there is pain from cold and it is treated with causal remedies and another treatment which has been said in the division, and the pain is not alleviated, then ignite the cautery, and this is the one that has been named punctual, of which this is the form.
And point the cautery at the ignition, and it should be led around the entire ear as if it were being turned, or in a circle of any shape if the pain is anywhere. Also, I will teach you about the cautery of the root of the ear, little by little, because you should sensibly touch the place with your finger.
And if you make points of cautery in the entire ear, and thus it is, and then cure the places until they are healed.
Chapter six.
On the cautery of gout.
Gout, which is treated and cured with cautery, is not only of the species that come through flux, according to what we have said in the divisions of the illnesses.
It requires cautery of the species that proceeds from dryness or spasm of the nerves.
When you treat that species of gout with herbs and head purges and gargles, and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary that you cautery the patient with three cauteries: the first at the root of the ear, the second a little below the same temple, and the third at the joint of two lips.
And pause your cautery for the opposite of the affected part, because mollification is not seen except in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cautery is that you cautery it with the cautery at the right of the extremity of the ear, slightly above the horn of the head, and in the temple another, the length of which is according to the length of the aforementioned finger, and pause your hand on the cautery until the quantity of the magnitude of the species of the codena is consumed.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species of cutting, the form of which is demonstrated on the table. However, it is more subtle because that one is a little thus as you see; and it is necessary to cut in it with excessive abundance a little.
And then cure the place where it is demonstrated, until it is healed.
Chapter seven.
On the cautery of ancient apoplexy.
When apoplexy is ancient and you treat it with what we have said and your medicine does not succeed and the patient has no fever, then cautery it with four cauteries: on all the horns of the head; and with a cautery in the same place on the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the neck. And the manner of the cautery is done according to what has been said above.
And then it is cautered on the mouth of the stomach; and it is more hidden; and then it is cured with what proceeds.
Chapter eight.

Chapter 12.
About the cauterization of water descending into the wheel.
When you have declared the commencement of water in the wheel through the signs which you had said in the division, then begin and give to drink to the patient who is afflicted with that which moistens his head, and guard against total humidity.
And make that sugar dissolve in water for some days.
And then command him to shave his head, and cauterize that with a cautery on the middle of the head; and then cauterize that with two cauteries on two temples if it is the commencement of watering in two wheels, or one side if it is the commencement of water in one wheel.
Including the veins and arteries which are beneath the codeina; and you will place the cauteries in that long length at the latitude of the temples.
And beware of fluxes of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see the fluxes of blood, or stop the flow with some medicine, which is as much as possible.
And you will find wisdom in the extraction of arteries and in the excision of those and caution against fluxes of blood.
And some veins are cauterized at the neck beneath two bones with two cauteries, producing derivative effects.
Chapter 13.
About the cauterization of old tears.
When the tears of the wheels are old and assuaged and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest place of the head before, and it is verified that this is superfluous fluid matter, then cauterize that with a cautery which we have recounted in the chapter about the commencement of water flowing from the wheels, and cauterize in the middle of the head and with two cauteries on the neck beneath two temples, and with two cauteries on the neck beneath two bones. And if you find indication of addition, then cauterize that on the entire side of the wheel above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
About the cauterization of foul odor of the nose.
When you medicate that with what we have said in the division and do not hasten your medication, then prepare and give to drink to the patient the cochias for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize that with a cautery, mingling a cautery of olive oil. And then cauterize that with a cautery nail and two cauteries on the two eyebrows beneath the hair, a small one.
And beware of the artery that you do not injure it.
And of the cautery nail, this is the method.
Chapter 15.
About the cauteries of softening of the eyelids of the wheels.
When the eyelid of the wheel is softened by disease or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery and this cautery is lunar; and this is its method.
And if you do so, cauterize that above the two eyebrows, a small one with two cauteries in the entire affected part, and then elongate from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the quantity of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, rather according to the quantity that the third part of the eyelid is affected.
Chapter 16.
About the cauteries of the eyelid of the wheel when the hairs are converted into the inner parts and puncture the wheel.
When the hairs of the wheel are converted into the inner parts and puncture the wheel, cauterize in those cases according to two methods, because the cautery is either with iron or with medicine combined.
If you cauterize it with fire, command the patient to place that beneath the wheel so that they can burn those hairs thus as those which are worldly, until they are prolonged and engulfed; and if you puncture that of his lord's naysement, then strengthen the wheels of it with a band so that it is not moved until the hairs are born.
Since they are born and engulfed, then stop the head of the patient in the tieu seat, and place a sign above the eyelid of the wheels of it with a tent, making a signal according to the figure of a leaf of myrtle, and let it be the commencement of the proper signal of the hairs.
And then stop constricted bowel in album of Huou or in mucilage of ptilli above the wheel.
And then ignite the cauteries of which this is the method.
And then cauterize above the figure which has been signified, little by little, in well-veiled motives, until the surface of the codeina is burned, which is thus as a leaf of myrtle, entirely apparent properly.
It seems that the sentence should be translated to:
So lift your hand and let it stay there for three days, and then place your hand on the outer thigh to eradicate the scar. And then heal that wound thoroughly so that it may be healthy.
But if the skin returns to its former condition for some reason and the eyelid becomes swollen, then do another time the cautery on that entire area as you had done previously.
But if the skin is on the eyelid below, then cauterize that until it returns to its natural location and is equalized, so that the skin does not press on the eye.
But the cautery is a burning medicine that commands the patient to lift the skin until it is prolonged and equalized, and then make a sheet of paper in the form of a leaf of myrtle.
And then take soap made from congealed goose fat and living worm oil. I think there may be a mistake in the original text. The phrase "caus viva" doesn't make sense, and "worm oil" is unlikely to be a real medical ingredient. Here's the translation:
And place the finger on the medicine and press it a little and do not move it until the patient feels the biting of the medicine, because the biting is in it thus as from fire.
And then as you perceive that the strong biting begins, then remove the medicine and wash your finger in water; then when the biting ceases, then remove the medicine from the eye with water; and then consider if sometimes the eyelid is lifted thus as it was washed from the constriction of fire or incision, because then it will be; and if it does not return to that place where the medicine was not applied and does not become discolored until your operation is equalized and the eye is contracted.
And then place your hand on the outer thigh to eradicate the swelling of the adjustment, and then heal that wound thoroughly or otherwise until it is healthy.
And it is necessary for you, from your operation to keep diligent vigilance so that in the eye no residue of the medicine falls, and if the eyelid after several days is swollen and some cause of the skin presses on the eye, then repeat your medicine on that place where the eyelid is swollen, and properly thus as you did at the beginning, and then heal it thoroughly until it is healthy.
And this is the form of myrtle leaves.
And you know that the eyes of men are diversified according to magnitude and smallness, and thus according to what was done your contraction.
And it will not be misleading the way of direct treatment for he who is studying in this art.
Chapter 17.
On the cautery of fistula that is in the tear duct of the eye.
When you cure a fistula with water that we have spoken of in the divisions of illnesses and do not confuse your cure, then it is necessary to cauterize it thus in this manner: command the patient to place his head in a warm place, and hold the head of some minister between their eyes in such a way that it is not moved nor agitated by the warm head.
And then place cotton wadding in an album of wool or in a mesh of little threads over the eye of it.
And then ignite the cautery of which this is the form:
Which should be conical, thus as it is in the form of a reed or a point of a wing, from one extremity to which the cautery was made.
And if you see, it should penetrate into the other extremity. And if you want it to come out thus as it was intended.
But I think that one who is skilled in this art is better at the third age.
And then take out the fistula if it is opened, and draw out its humor and dry that. And if it is not opened, then operate on that and extract the pus from it.
And then place on the eye the cautery which was ignited, and you have that in the warm hand a little away from the cautery of the eye to the parting of the nose, so that your hand does not err or the patient is not disturbed, and then place the cautery in the gray areas of the eye and corrupt that.
And then at the beginning of the eye's cautery, you see into the bone, it is; and if not, then repeat the cautery one or two times, if it is necessary; and leave that thus for three days, and then place on the outer thigh to eradicate and wrap it in a thoroughly dried poultice until it is healthy.
If it has been passing eleven days and there is no health, then stop using the sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is discovered and is scraped according to what is convenient in the seventh chapter.
And there is another manner of cautery for fistula, which first-time doctors use: then at the place of the fistula and make a hole in it, and place a subtle instrument like a thin rod; and put in it a quantity of one ounce of melted lead; and hold your hand firmly with good retention, and do not let the patient move so that the melted lead does not penetrate to the hollow of that; and cover the hollow of the patient's body with albumen or egg white, or water, because the lead adheres to the place of the fistula and heals it miraculously.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about the cautery and the cure, it is well; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a treatment through the nose and reduce the fistula to its proper place in the body of the nose, as it will come into its own location.
Chapter 18.
On the cautery of the fracture of the toes.
Wounds caused by accidental fissures in the lips, and especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat those fissures with what we have said in the divisions and do not deepen your treatment, then apply the small cutting cautery according to this form that is described:
And it is the conquest of it according to the subtlety of the scalpel.
Then stop putting that initiative carefully into those fissures until the cautery penetrates to the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat it with wax until it is healed.

On the cautery of fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula or in the palate or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess is formed and then breaks, and then it bursts, and then it becomes chronic, and the pain increases and a fistula is made, and you treat it and do not deepen your treatment, then stop, so that you ignite the cautery according to the quantity that has been received in the fistula, and place that ignition in the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand inside until the iron ignites at the bottom of it, and afterwards makes a wound or two; and treat it with what we have said about the cure until it is healed.
And therefore if the wound is abscessed and healed, it is well; and if not, then it is necessary to discover the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
On the cautery of teeth and softening of gums.
When the gums are softened by humidity and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and do not confide, then stop, place the head of the patient in the tieu seat, and ignite the cautery in the form that will come, thus you stop the gum on the tooth and insert it into the ignited cautery, holding your hand firmly so that the patient feels the heat of the fire at the root of the tooth to be penetrated.
And then lift your hand, and then repeat the cautery with some wounds according to what you want.
And then let the patient hold his mouth full of salt water and keep it for an hour, and afterwards stop, because the loose tooth is strengthened and the softened gum is stiffened and the corrupting humidity is dried out.
Chapter 21.
On the cautery of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or if there is cold or worm in it, or does not confide in the cure with medicine, then cautery is applied in two ways: either cautery with a cow's horn, or cautery with fire.
Cautery with a cow's horn is that you take a cow's horn and boil it in iron culhe, and then take the tip and wrap it around the extremity of the tent, and then immerse it in the boiling horn, and stop it on the painful tooth firmly until it is cooled.
And then repeat it several times until the virtue of the fire penetrates to the root of the teeth.
And if you wish, submerge the wax or tip in the aforementioned horn, and stop it on the painful tooth, and stop it on that ignited iron until the iron penetrates to the bottom of the conquest of the tooth.
However, the emperor prohibits the cautery with fire because you attend to the quantity of iron or of fire, and it is in the heart of some grossness and the acuity of the fire does not penetrate to the mouth of the patient.
And then ignite the cautery in the form that will come, and stop it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled; and do some wounds because the pain will be relieved or on that day or the next day.
And you should cover the area where the cautery was applied to the patient's mouth with a good bandage and hold it for an hour, and then scrape off the residue; this is the form of the cautery.
You should cauterize as much as you can reach to the extreme parts according to what is possible for you.
And this is the form of the pipe or tube.
Chapter 22.
On the cauterization of clubfoot.
When clubfoot is caused by flux and cold humors and does not respond to digestion through medications and you see the digestion of those lightly, then you ignite the cautery in the form that is as follows: having two hubertas of extremities so that the smoke goes from one extremity to the other, and pause that ignition over the aposteme for a while, and another servant indicates that of it, until it reaches the root of the aposteme.
And if the aposteme is small, then pause the cautery according to the quantity of the aposteme, and leave it for three days and pause over the area affected in a good bandage until it is remedied what the fire has burnt.
And then heal that limb with ointments and dressings until it is healthy.
Chapter 23.
On the cauterization of gout of the foot and contraction of the thigh.
When humidity comes over the canal of the lung, and especially when that is with frigidity of complexion, then it is necessary for the patient to be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medications, and then cauterize from the root of the gout in the affected area.
And beware that you do not reach the cautery to the gout nor burn the cartilage of it, but only a little.
And cauterize that with another cautery from the joint of the neck to the posterior spine of it. And the cautery of it should be shaped like a key in the previous manner.
And then heal that limb with what has been previously mentioned until it is healthy.
Chapter 24.
On the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humidity and the patient has no fever nor tiredness and it is an old disease, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the furcula in the affected areas of the loins and chest; and another cautery in the middle area of the chest between two nipples; and shape the cautery like a key according to the previous form.
And if you wish, let your cautery be pointed with the cauteries that are called points, the form of which is previously mentioned in the puncture of ear pain.
And let them be points until they reach those; and then heal that limb with what has been previously mentioned until it is healthy.
And now the cautery has three levels because cauterization is in that: one time you can do three cauteries according to this form.
Chapter 25.
On the cauterization of stuttering which is a help for the head.
When the head of the stutterer is dislocated due to lubricating humidity and does not stay in its place at the time of its return, until it is in its usual custom of returning, and then by a small movement it is dislocated thus that it is ended, thus as we have testified, then it is necessary first to reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be turned over onto their back or left side; and then lift the cartilage which is in the upper part of the citillic to the upper parts with your left hand, if the joint is dislocated below.
And then ignite the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the cartilage until it penetrates into the other side; and you will find the figure of cauterization then with four heads of cauteries.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count and because they are the eight cauteries.
And then pause over the cauteries for a while, and then make the patient adhere to tranquility, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is comforted.
And if the dislocation is above and it is done thus, then cauterize over the muscle with a key-shaped cautery or three pointed cauteries, because the joint is confirmed and the humidity is removed and the patient is healthy.
Chapter 26.
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and humidity enter the stomach to the point that it extracts its completeness and is multiplied into it, and if you continue the manners of cure and do not confide, then it is necessary for the patient to be on their back raised, and extend their arms and legs, and then cauterize that with three cauteries: one cautery below the chest for the quantity of a finger in a key-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below the two sides of the cautery, until the triangular figure of the cautery is obtained; and elongate between those that are not adjusted so they do not make putrefaction.
And if the depth of the cautery equals the amount of the two thirds of the thickness of the cartilage.
And this is the shape of the cautery according to this form, and if you wish, make a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery according to the circular form.
And the stomach should be cauterized at the point where it is frightened by this cautery: and it is that you feel on the stomach point according to the quantity that you wish to hold, and then cauterize it with this cautery at the points; and then cure it with the cure that precedes until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the cauterization of the cold fever.
When the fever is induced by coldness or humidity or gross ventosity until the normal complete complexion is gotten through excessive egress, and it is cured with the medicine that we have said and not comforted, then it is necessary that the patient be resupinated on their bed, and feel with three cauteries according to this form and this measured quantity on the feverish place below the hip, where one perceives the decubitus of home.
And this is the space which is between each cautery according to the thickness of the finger, and it should be a cautery according to the length of the right body.
And do not include your hand in the motion of the cautery.
And if the amount of water that has been absorbed is equal to the amount of the marrow of the cartilage, and it is not yet adjusted; and if the patient stands on their feet; and if they are not standing, then let them sit, who has already extended their thighs, and lifted their legs.
And it is possible that you can cauterize these cauteries with a cutting cautery, when you are with subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too quickly in the cauterization, and it is absorbed the specificity of all the cartilage so that it is absorbed throughout the body and penetrates into the intestines, because the cartilage here is subtle; and you will know this.
Chapter 28.
On the perforation of an abscess of the fever with a cautery.
When there is an ulceration or abscess in the fever and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the fever or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the fever, the patient will be troubled with grave gravity and pain will be acute.
And if it is in the tunic of the fever, then the pain will be greatly acute and many times the doctors are exhausted from curing it.
Therefore it is necessary that the patient be turned over onto their bed; and then feel the place of the abscess with your hand; and then ignite the cautery which is assembled like a rag, in the form of which has been described on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the cartilage is burned away, until it reaches the siphac, until it makes a sane scar.
And then cure it with the cure of other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that from this form of cautery use except that which the student in the art of medicine has prolonged, and in the hands of which many maladies are known; more I have experimented on some vague occasions and have been bold about this operation, more I have left those writings to you, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of ulcers.
The ancient cauteries of the roots of aristology ulcerate according to this manner of being made, and it is this that you take from the roots of aristology a long dry root which is found, and it should be of the thickness of a finger.
And then submerge it in oil and expose it to fire, and then cauterize with a cautery at the place where it is between the continuation of the furcula and the neck; and there are two small cauteries below guiding, one slightly declining towards the part that is below the beard, and there are two cauteries in what is declining between the fifth rib and the nipple, declining slightly towards the back parts; and there is another cautery at the middle place of the foot, and another on the stomach, and three cauteries on the back parts; and there is a cautery at the place where it is between the two shoulders, and there are two cauteries of the two sides of the foot, below the cautery that is between the two shoulders.
And it is not fitting that you include your hand in the cautery, but rather it should be in the manifestation of the cartilage in operation.
And thus I have described the ancient ways that are ancient among men who use iron-like cauteries resembling a ray and ignite them, and place them at the place where it is between the ribs, until they reach that abscess and make a sane scar, just as we have said in the abscess of the fever.
In this perforation, do not use pointed cautery, because too much humor accumulates in the location of the fistula, which is not healthy.
Chapter .xxx.
On the cauterization of the thigh.
When you treat the thigh ailment in the way we have discussed about treatment in division and do not confuse your treatment, then cauterize in three manners, all of which are direct, one of which is to make three or four lines according to the length of the thigh, following the shape of the cauteries of the foot, whose shape has preceded.
And let there be between each cautery the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of the cautery should be the manner which we have mentioned in the cauteries of the foot, similarly.
And do not comprehend your hand at the cautery; and the patient should be seated on a stool with two legs.
And there is another manner of cauterizing, that is to ignite the cautery having two vertiments, which causes we have mentioned in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and it raises the codeine which is at the end of the thigh where the patient feels the pain on the affected side.
And let your elevation be the one that raises the codeine according to the length of the body, so that you make pointed cauteries according to the width of the body.
And then insert the two vertiments, ignite motion, in that entry where they penetrate the codeine of the other part.
And then extract the cautery; and thus make four pointed cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three vertiments.
And then you will cure the cautery better than having to grasp or bend for three days, because it is more comfortable than the other causes preceding in the treatment.
Chapter .xxxi.
On the cauterization of dropsy.
Cauteries are not made in dropsy, but rather in a specific location properly.
When you treat the dropsy, in the manners of treatment which we have mentioned in the division and do not confuse your treatment, then it is necessary that those cauteries are four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery on the stomach, and another cautery on the foot, and another cautery on the thigh, and two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right side of the foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the specificity of the codeine.
And then leave the cautery open so that you hold or bend for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment then with the cautery as it is necessary for them to be added to the two intentions, and it will be fastened to the doctor's healthy aid.
The shape of the cautery that is cauterizing the belly is club-shaped according to the shape of that which precedes, and it is that which is cauterizing the back and is olive-shaped according to its preceding form.
Chapter .xxxii.
On the cauterization of feet and of the thighs.
When the feet are apostematized in dropsy and are full of stagnant water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot at night, where it is between the auricular and anular, and raise your hand on the cautery and do not twist it; and then raise your hand, and do not return it entirely, because the stagnant water recedes.
The cauteries are according to this form: And then make pointed ones on the two thighs, and in each thigh a pointed cautery at the extremity of the cutting cautery. And the cauteries are according to the length of the thigh: one on the denolh and another on the middle place of the thigh; and on each thigh two cauteries.
And then leave the open plague for a long time, so that some water recedes from it.
And then cure them with those causes which we have mentioned.
Chapter .xxxiii.
On the cauterization of the belly and abdomen.
When the belly and abdomen are cold and humid inside so that they debilitate the vertebrae, it is the digestive and retentive virtue, which are in the stomach and intestines, and it is cured with those manners of treatment and do not confuse, and sometimes the patient suffers from exhibiting vertebrae cauteries, then cauterize them with a large cautery on the navel according to what has preceded in the cauterization of the stomach, with the circular cautery and four cauteries in the subtle circuit of the navel, with a subtle club-shaped cautery; and with a cautery on the alcatin above the great aloes, or with two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humidity exhibits and the patient tolerates, then cauterize them on the pentenilh and on the intestines, and strongly adjust two cauteries on the stomach and near the inguinal region, because it is a perfect cure of youthful vigor, from which you do not err.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of ancient hemorrhoids.
When they are in the nature of old hemorrhoids or one of gross humors that corrupts or humidities corrupted, and are cured with what has been said in the division and does not conform to the proper cure, then cauterize with three cauteries above the pus below the spine of the small back, and with a cautery above the umbilical region for two digits.
And if it happens that their stomach is inflamed and their food is not digested, and their face is often apostemated, then cauterize that above the stomach with a large cautery according to what has been prescribed; and with a cautery on the side, and another cautery on the navel of theirs with a clave-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery for some time open, and then cure them from the inside so that they may be healthy.
Chapter 35.
On the cauterization of athelia, proper for their abscesses.
When you abscess athelia, then you ignite the cautery that is assembled in a row. Then insert that ignited cautery into the abscessed athelia, and ultimately apply it inward so that you bring the cautery to the orifice of the vein from which the blood flows.
And make a vein or two, because if the achieyl are too many, then cauterize some of them according to what has been recounted, and then cure those who have veins that conform to their own joints so that they may be healthy.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on the alcoves, it is more durable in youth.
Chapter 36.
On the cauterization of fistulas that are formed in the nature of their own parts.
When the nature does not obey the work that has been recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by it, then heal with a cautery.
So when you have a fistula in the old nature, and it is antiquated, corroding their health and humidities corrupted, and so that which is more worthy than the one that covers is that which proceeds with a subtle tension, and then conveys the quantity of the profundity of theirs before the aforementioned tension.
Then ignite the cautery that is similar to a row. And then insert that ignited cautery into this fistula, and according to the quantity in which you introduce the tension.
And iterate over that cautery inward so that they burn those corrupted bodies all together one or two or three times, according to the quantity of your necessary need.
And beware of combustion of nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all those places; and do not do it unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it does not penetrate.
And then cure the place inward so that it may be healthy.
And if the place is sealed, and you have abscessed from them the materials, and remained thus for a long time, then you will know that it has been fully cured.
And if the materials are not abscessed from them, then you will know that it is penetrating or in the region of their corrupted bone, or thus because of those causes which will bring remembrance to its place.
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of the kidneys.
When in the kidneys there is pain due to cold or gross ventosity, and thus the coil of the patient's thigh is weakened, then it is fitting that you cauterize above the kidneys with a clave-shaped cautery on each kidney, from which proceeds the remembrance.
And strengthen their cauterization in the second little behind, so that three linear cauteries will come, and then they will be more durable in youth.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When there is debilitation and mollification in the bladder due to cold and humidities, so that the patient's urine does not retain, then cauterize that in the part below about the bladder, where the skin of the perineum begins, and cauterize with a cautery on the right part, and another on the left side of theirs.
And the length of each cautery is according to the quantity of notes on the foot; and cauterize that with a cautery in the part below the lower back, or with two cauteries if it is necessary.
And it is a clave-shaped cautery according to what has been proceeded.
Chapter 39.
On the cauterization of the matrix (womb).
When cold and humidity come to the matrix (womb), and thus it is prohibited from conception, and their menses are corrupted, and the provocation of theirs is delayed, and there is pain because of the havement of theirs, then it is fitting that the place be cauterized with three cauteries in the circuit of the umbilical region, just as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a clave-shaped cautery above the place below the back, or with two cauteries.
Chapter 40.
On the cauterization of dislocation of the ankle.
When moisture accumulates and is retained in the ankle joint, and it causes inflammation of the surrounding tissue, and it seems that the thigh is prolonged over the other when compared between them. And the place of the dislocation is palpated in the said boy's thigh.
Then you should cauterize the patient's ankle joint with a circular cautery, because you have sensed that it is tense in the circuit of the joint, and thus it revolves, and so that the joint falls into its proper place within the circle.
And this is the cautery which precedes the form in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at your disposal, then cauterize with three olive-shaped cauteries.
And make the cautery according to the quantity of the inspection of the entire body; and then take care that it be healed within.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the ankle joint, and it is caused by cold and moisture, the patient is cured with what we have said and not contradicted, and what is ancient, then you should remove the patient from gross humors with fetid pills or artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize.
And the manner of the cautery in that is according to two manners: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
It will be according to two scientific manners, one of which is that it cauterizes the ankle joint with three triangular cauteries in this form; and do so at a good depth. And the space between each cautery is the quantity of the thickness of the said joint, and so the olive-shaped or large cautery.
Some withered veins are the cauteries on the same place on the head of the ankle, because there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle in which the form precedes in the cauterization of the dislocation of the ankle, and that the circle contains and burns the inspection of the entire body.
And this is the manner of cautery in every case when pain is adhering to the ankle and does not extend into the thigh.
But if it is extended into the thigh, then cauterize with two cauteries on the thigh at the place where the patient's pain turns, and with one cautery on the hip for four days, a little below the affected part.
And if the cautery is cutting, and its depth is according to the quantity of the inspection of the body.
And if the patient turns where the pain is extended into the place close to the feet, then cauterize there where it turns with three points or four or even more if it is necessary for that.
And if the patient turns with pain being below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a cutting cautery.
And beware in all cauterization that you do not exceed with the cautery so much that it burns nerves or major arteries, and that for this reason you are above the patient's evil or contradiction.
And you have already seen one or another of those who cauterize on the hip and ultimately in the cauterization, and the inflamed flesh swells into the tumor that reaches the foot, and it is perforated and corrupted throughout the entire foot. And then a strong solution of wine, and then this leads to death.
And if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this manner.
And I will describe the wise men in the cauterization of ankle joints, which is this manner: make a circle of iron wire whose circumference is the size of one palm; and it should be from seven or eight inches, according to the thickness of one finger's bone or a little less.
And divide that circle into another third; and the space between them is the quantity of the thumb's nail; and these circles are divided into two parts; and their length is one or two inches, and make in that margin of iron decently appareled in the circles; and this is their form.
Then ignite it in the fire until it is red-hot and emits sparks, and then place it on the ankle joint, the patient collects themselves on the side of the bed. And then cauterize with three red-hot cauteries in one go.
And then leave it for three days; then apply a plaster with bandages and leave the ulcerated wound for many days; and then take care of it until it is healed.
Says Albucassis: Oh, my sons, of this species of cautery few have used for the terror of the regard of it, and for that reason few have found those who regard it above all.
More of the cauteries are applied to him who suffers from it, and apply them again in that place.
More cauteries are medicines that adhere, which you make two circles having a perforated armula in which the iron rod of the door of iron is inserted; it is the length of the partition in the narrowness of their shoes or those nails.
And if the space which is between each of them according to the quantity of the thickness of the digit; and thus you open below and above, and thus they contain themselves among their following this form:
And then pause on the partition of the water the patient is sitting on, and comprehend your hand on the partition of the water; and take heated water and put it between two circles, and the quality of that should be at a small fire, little by little, and hold that for the quantity of an hour, and suffer the patient the moderate heat and the adjustment of it — because that adjusts the moderate heat thus from fire — until the heat ceases.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and evacuate the heated water from all of the water into warm water.
And then leave that for three days and pause on that border until the blackness of the adjusted remainder is seen, and leave that for some days, and correct the purification of it; this is the last step in healing.
And then cure him who is wounded until he is healthy.
And if the pain is extended into the thigh or leg, make a statue of him containing water according to what is done in the water immersion.
And this is the method of heated water, and I have already written that in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Recipe of alkali and cause not extinct of two names in one partition, and crush them and pause in a new vessel of which the partition below is perforated by a small tube, according to the quantity that enters into the liquid.
And pause below the bottom of another vessel, and pour over that alkali and cause living water which covers those for one digit, and since you comprehend those with your tie-fastened hand for good compression, and leave the hole that separates from the liquid water in the partition below to the other vessel.
And then adjust all that water, and pour it over another living cause and other renovated alkali, because at that time it will be of great fortitude, which is administered in many operations of medicine and in cautery of the other members, because the operation makes fire.
And thus of the medicines some are those which are cautered often, thus you will find and mix and blend and cause to know in that way so that they are mixed.
And Gualia recounts of a man of the ancients the operation and the cure in which he was cured of water pain and of sciatic vein, and magnifies much to be of that, and says that there is no need for another cure, and because it is healthy for a season thus as recommended, because strong is the one who enters into bath and exercises already of that.
And it is that he takes some green certarragi, and if there is no green certarragi found, take a fresh fig; and much is crushed into a few gray ones and paused on the water where the pain is, or in the thigh, or in the leg, and bind.
And let it be for a duration of three hours or for the quantity that the patient feels comfort from the adjustment.
And then put him in bath and when his body is warmed, insert him into the sun, because the pain ceases and he is healthy.
And know that it does not cover that some use of cauteries is in these medicines, but rather the evacuation of the body.
More, Escorides says that when an opening of goat's vein is cautered, it benefits him; and the cautery is in this manner: take wool and dip it in old oil, and pause it between the toes of the foot and between the fossils.
And then take dry goat's opening and inflame that in fire until it is made charcoal; and then pause it over the wool and leave it until it is stretched. And then iterate that, and do not cease doing that until the sentiment of the moderate heat penetrates into the water and relieves the pain.
And this manner of cautery is called cautery of goat's horns.
Chapter 42.
Of the cautery of pain of toes.
Some days' pain is in the toes for many causes, such as for bruising or percussion or excessive evacuation, and for similar causes, through infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cauteries are not made except in this sole species which is done by effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, it covers, then evacuate the patient with pills fitted and similar to theirs, which are made on the toes where the pain is three lines according to the latitude of it, because you have ten in each line or cauteries or more, according to the quantity that one sees of the tolerance of the patient and of its virtue.
And it should be done with a pointed cautery.
If you want, cauterize with three or four cauteries or with a medium-sized clave in the middle, following this form.
Chapter 43.
About cautery at the commencement of gibosity.
Soft words are given to this sickness in little children; and the sign of its commencement in children is that they stumble upon their structure in the wings and elevate with difficulty and limited movement.
And the vertebrae in the back of the spine begin to rise above the others, on top of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae that have already started to overlie.
And thus when you see this and want to prohibit it, then cauterize with a circle-shaped cautery following this form. which takes the cautery all over the entire affected part of the spine in a circular motion.
And if you want, cauterize around the circle of the spine with a pointed cautery of two lines or three. And place the points properly among them.
And then cure the area within, so that it will be healthy with what we have said.
Be careful that cautery is not administered in gibosity that is caused by spasm of nerves.
Chapter 44.
About cautery for gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And thus how gout caused by cold is cured in many ways of cure and the pains are not relieved, then relief comes from cautery.
And it is that you should cauterize with evacuation around the circle of the joint of the foot with several cauteries.
And this cautery is olive-shaped, of which this is its form.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pains go inside the teeth or to other joints, and this many words are given to you, then cauterize that on each tooth with three or four cauteries of the entire affected part with that olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed, which these cauteries are necessary for you, then cauterize that and do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery beforehand, it is only just around the specific area of the codena.
And if the pains go inside the tooth and the back, then administer the cautery which we have said in the seventh chapter.
And if the pains are only in the jaws, and it is called sagra, then prick around the circle of the gums thus as they revolve, prick in those two lines.
And if the pains remain in the fingers, then prick around the circle of the gums on each knot and on the pincer of the hand.
And if the pains go near the joints to the veins or to the muscles, then cauterize the affected parts of the joints.
And do not evacuate the sickness with good regimen and reception of medicines, because if it is done with good regimen and evacuation is done with this cautery, it will be healthy, God helping.
Chapter 45.
About cautery for fractures.
When there is a fracture in the limbs and the intestines are dislocated from their cavity, and it begins to cure itself, then you should command the sickness to leave its nourishment on the seventh day and use lenient causes so that the wound will heal on the seventh day.
And then follow the sickness between your hands over the seventh two, and command it to hold the seventh wing inside so that it will be strong or appear with its cavity or intestines.
And then return that to the ties of the fingers and sew up the rupture over the bone of the fifth finger, signifying the extremity of which it is similar to the circle of the subordinate parts of the body.
And then ignite the cautery of which this is its form.
until it will be very red and have many sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area so that the intestine will not come out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And then stop the cautery on that sign with your hand as a straight cautery, and you will see that the bones of the fifth finger are aligned inside the middle of the two; and if it does not work in the first instance, try again in another way until you reach the bone.
And observe carefully the movement of the intestine during your cautery, that you do not burn the intestine so that on the patient no death or other great evil comes.
You should know that when you hold the cautery, do not touch the bone, nor confuse your operation.
And be careful that the cautery for children is subtle according to their age and measure of theirs.
Then treat the area of the cautery for three days with a warm poultice until the scar is reduced by the heat.
Then treat those who have other afflictions until they are healthy.
And let the patient sit on a soft couch for forty days until the area is sealed and the plague.
And be careful that you pause the nourishment of it according to the length of time of its cure, which lines up with the belly of it, and that the intestine does not come out during the effort of healing.
And then when one wants to get up after forty days, then administer gentle and decent food, and hold that for another forty days.
And be mindful of toil and replenishment of food and drink, and of violent vomiting, because when one uses this entire regimen of healing, they will surely be healthy.
And you will direct the healing of ruptures in other parts of the belly, and so from the beginning, and you want that they do not burst, then cauterize the rupture of that which is being cauterized abundantly according to its quantity, and it is that which is exhaling from the codena as well as the third part of it; and then treat that which we have said, and it will be adjusted.
And you will find some primary rupture that is cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form, because it is signified by a tender point.
And it is a paused line that goes for the width in the flesh because it surrounds the rupture, and another line below; and place your hand with a keyed cautery, but the first cautery is better and more gentle.
Chapter 46.
On the Cauterization of Hernia.
When an injury occurs in some members by fall or by percussion pain and it persists for a long time and does not respond to medical treatment, then be careful to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And it is the cautery of each member according to its size and smallness, and its strength and development, and location of hernia and pain.
Therefore if it is not healthy from the first cautery, well; and if not, then iterate over it with the cautery; because of the custom of those pains it is that they are punctured in a member next to that member which approaches you, so that you be careful to conserve those with the cautery until the patient is healthy.
Chapter 47.
On the Cauterization of Leprosy.
The leprous ulcers are treated with a cautery for great improvement, and magnificently if the species of leprosy that is made by putrefaction of flesh and melancholy.
And so when you want to cauterize that, consider if the leprosy is common and as that cured with what we have said in the division and not delayed, nor this, and fear about the patient that the corruption comprehends the whole body of it and its entire complexity, then cauterize that on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and one below it, and another on the forehead to the end of the hairs; and two above the horns; and one behind, on the nape or neck.
And finally place your hand with the cautery a little inside so that you press on the bone a small impression, and from it the scabs are dislocated, so that the expiration of gross vapors is alleviated; and cauterize on the molars according to what is prescribed.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and appears manifestly, then be careful to cauterize that with those cauteries which we have said on the head; and one cautery on the extremity of the nose, and two cauteries on the two molars, and two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the vertebrae near the hip, and one on the hip, and two on the loins, and one on each loin, and two on the ankles, and one on each ankle, and two on the knees, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of the soft foot; and cauterize that on all the joints of the said limbs and feet, and on each talon of the soles of the feet, and on the foscils of their hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the ankle that you do not burn those.
And some ulcers are cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the thigh and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And you should know that the more you adjust the cauteries, the more it improves and the more it confers; and you should know that the patient does not have pain in the cautery, as they have said, so that the body of it is already stupefied.
It seems that this sentence means:
And then heal the cautery in the fire of burning coals, mixing well and making another healing within so that it is healthy.
Chapter 48.
About the cauterization of numbness or stupor.
When a member is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and emplasters, and it is not healed, then you cauterize that numb member with cauteries according to the greatness of the member or its smallness.
And let your cautery enter the inspection of the cord in a little while. And then heal that one who is wounded, until it is healthy.
And some wounded people are cauterized for certain numbness which goes to the hands and feet, and to the vertebrae of the back and eyes, and it is the movement of the nerves which makes that member, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not presume upon it except for one who is skilled in the anatomy of the members and the exit of the nerves throughout the whole moving body.
Chapter 49.
About the cauterization of ulcers that are gangrenous.
When ulcers are old and do not respond to the usual remedies of medicine, then you cauterize over that ulcer with a pointed cautery for a little while according to the quantity of the specific cord until the whiteness and color of it are restored, and its color is changed.
And then heal that ulcer with the fire of coals and of lentils, with rose oil and with leaves of dragon's blood, and with dove's blood or pigeon's blood, each one a part and all are mixed together, and then let it be anointed with a cloth and placed over the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
About the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize that part with a circular cautery around the circumference of it, so that it is completely removed.
And I advise the wise ones that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle place; but to me it has not been seen, because I fear that it is ulcerated, and you have already seen some wounded people.
And it is better to return to the previous method of cauterizing in a circle around it, as we have said, or with multiple cauteries.
Chapter 51.
About the cauterization of indurations.
When some indurations are delayed in maturity, and thus it is because of the superfluous fat that makes them, or because of the state of the patient, which is old and decrepit, with little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the maturity of indurations; then cauterize around the circumference with many small pointed cauteries; and afterwards let it be, for it will fasten in maturity.
But if you want to make a perforation with the cautery, then you ignite the cautery of which this is the form; and place it in the middle of the induration until it penetrates the cord.
And if you make the cautery in that place which is below, so that the body of the arm is alleviated; and then heal it until it is healthy.
Chapter 52.
About the cauterization of corroding ulcers.
Corroding ulcers are corrupting wounds in the member, which corrode as if a focus of dry gangrene is eating away.
Then if you want to cauterize that corroding ulcer in the place where it suffers from a focus, then you ignite cauteries with many small nails, and large ones according to what is convenient in that place where it is corroding.
And then cauterize that entire part until you eradicate all the corrosion and there remains no cause of it.
And then let it be for three days, and apply over the cauterized places a triple ointment mixed together until all scars are totally eradicated and all corruption.
And then heal that wounded flesh generating new flesh.
But if after three days the flesh is born healthy in which there is no corruption, good; but if not, then repeat the cautery over that which remains corrupt in the corrupted places.
And corroding ulcers are treated with some old remedies of acute medicine, because that is half in place of cautery. But the emperor's cautery is of worse reputation, and it is to be used with more judgment.
And you have already said the cure of the member with acute medicine in the division, and therefore take that when the hours of urgency come.
Chapter 53.
About the cauterization of wounds and of other similar things.
Many wounded people go to the lower parts of the foot with maladies which are called wounds, and it is a gross, inward cause, which takes away the foot; and cauteries are made in those places according to two manners, that is to say, with fire and with water heat.
The more cauteries are focused where they ignite like a fiery furnace, the one that is made of iron according to the quantity that it contains in its entirety, and is of subtle margins.
And then stop the ignition on the nail, and return your hand to the cautery in the circle of the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail. And leave it like that for three days until you start to feel better. And then apply a plaster made with soothing mallows, saved and crushed in salt, and leave the plaster on for a night, because it will eradicate its roots.
And then heal the place affected by generating flesh until it is healthy.
And if it does not convert, and you have applied poultices on the surface of the body, mainly on the hands and feet, then it is necessary that you administer to those cauteries in water, and it is that you take a small tube of iron or of fiery furnace, and place it on the nail; and then put your hand in the tube of hot water, and hold it, and you return with compression of your hand all around, and it is inserted into the margin of the tube at the root of the nail, and you extract the hot water through the hole at the root of the toe; and wait for a little while, about an hour, for the bite of the hot water to penetrate, and then remove it, because the nail with its roots will be eradicated.
And thus do to those ones and then add another until you come upon all the whys of their suffering in the body.
And then heal those pustules because the roots of the nails are eradicated, and the flesh will regenerate on its own.
Chapter 3.
On the cauterization of trembling.
When you have a trembling due to cold in the nerves or fever caused by cold, or another similar cause, then it is necessary that you cauterize with four cauteries or five on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra a cautery; and a cautery on their chest, and on their stomach, a cautery on the olive-shaped spot.
And the trembling of it is restored and strengthened by the health of the patient's cold constitution.
Chapter 4.
On the cauterization of sudden accidents to the body.
When the body is suddenly afflicted, and there are pustules that are made of gross corrupt materials; therefore it is necessary at the beginning to appear, that it be cauterized on every head of the fistula with a subtle cautery made of myrtle, the extremity of which is extended into a fiery point; or with a long herbal root; or with a slow-burning cautery.
And sometimes applied poultices are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method; and they are not believed, and it is disrupted, the superfuous excess that makes them, and it heals them.
The emperor commands that this be done with evacuation through bloodletting.
Chapter 6.
On the cauterization of fluxes of blood due to accidental injury of an artery.
Many applied poultices flow from the artery that is injured by the wound which it has in front, or by the beginning of abscesses or cauteries of the limb, and therefore it seems difficult to remove that.
Therefore when it reaches to that point, then you should hold with your hand at the orifice of the artery, and stop there until the flow of blood is stopped, and it does not come out.
And then stop at the focus of the olive-shaped cauteries, few and great in number, and extract them until they are completely ignited.
And then take from those a small or large one according to the place and wound in which the artery is broken, on that vein firmly holding it back so that you may reattach the orifice, and return the cautery until the blood is confined and restrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you reattach the orifice and extract the cautery, then take another cautery carefully prepared from the cauteries which are in the focus, and thus do not cease to do this until the blood is restrained.
And beware that you do not touch the nerves which are here, and that another evil comes upon the patient with another malice.
And you know that when the arterial flow of blood is strong, then it is not possible to restrain the blood in those, and especially when the artery is large, if not one of four methods: either with a cautery as I have said, or with extraction when it is not extracted, because when it is extracted the extremities of my veins are burned and the blood is restrained, or that it be tied with a strong ligature, or that it be stopped by medicines which have the virtue of restraining the blood; and they are strengthened in the pulvinar with a decent constriction.
Those who administer restrictive diet to the patient with a wounded limb and a strained joint, or drops by positioning causes combustion and similarity, do not comfort unless it is bitter.
But if there is an end to the disease and it does not seem like a doctor's presence or medicine, then work on the treatment of the indicated finger over the orifice of that vein, thus having said, and understand the great constriction within so that the blood flow is obstructed from the superior part of the plague, and above the artery it does not seem to be reopened; and above the artery, it seems to be constricted by a great deal of coldness within so that the blood flow is congealed and thickened; and but you may try if there is need for cautery or necessary medicine.
Of incision and perforation and of vein sections and of flea-biting and of sores and of their similarities.
I have said in the first chapter all about malady in which cautery fire is convenient and burning medicine, and the occasions and causes of it, and the instruments necessary for the forms of cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters according to the subordinated arrangement of the head to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter with that method, so that it may be clarified to whoever wants it, then above what will be demanded.
And therefore I begin here, cove, son, that you learn that in this chapter is to terrify whoever it is from the first chapter of cautery.
And for that which is in great caution, because in the operation which is in this chapter many evacuated catheters are thrown away, which is with blood in which there is life by means of aspiration of the vein or incision over the aposteme or percussion of the exsiture or purification of the plague or extraction of a dart or incision of rock and their similarities. And all those accompany fear and trembling and in the end of their cat [patients] death.
And I warn you that upon you does not fall that which is in the sitting, because some evacuated cases happen to you in the manner of men who have many manners of maladies. And of them it is certain that they will flee from their malady and it is far from them the death, and thus for the vehemence of that which finds its malady, and for the length of the malady of him, and in the malady it is fear for that which means death.
And of those it is the one that gives to your son to have and to say, you hope for that health, and the following malady is pernicious.
And therefore do not think that you consent to that which is seen by you of this manner; and your caution should be greater than what is thought and your rapidity; and do not presume any cause over that unless certain scientific knowledge verifies it for you, and at which point you perceive successful success.
And you will be established in the cure of all your maladies by prognosis and indication of him which is converted salvation, because in that it is to you helpers above acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and glory.
Oh, sons, God inspires your understanding and does not lack direction and protection, because that is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter distinct from chapters according to what precedes in the chapter of cauteries, of the cure from head to feet, so that it may be clarified to you what you demanded of it and of which you have need.
First Chapter.
Of the cure of water that is contained in the head of children.
You know that this malady many times ends in children from birth and when the nurse strengthens the child's head with their livelihood.
And some evacuated cases end because of hidden cause which is not known.
But I have not seen this malady except in children; and to all those whom I have seen it has been the sign of death, and thus it is to me a sad and lamentable work in them.
And I have seen that a child's head which was full of water swelled, and the child's head was so magnificent until it ceased to be able to support itself by means of the greatness of its head, and more that the humidity made it increase until it died from heat.
And this humidity or is added between the skull and the bone, or is added beneath the bone above the siphon.
Because the operation in that case if the humidity is between the skull and the bone and the aposteme is small, then it is known that you find in the middle of the head with a fissure in the latitude, and let the length of the fissure be two inches until the humidity runs, and this is the form of the spatula.
And therefore if the humidity is more increased and the aposteme is greater, then there are two fissures here in this manner.
If humidity is in the bones, it seems that you have taken the entire top of the head away from the partitions and the water is squeezed out when you comprehend that the tie is tight on the partitions and not squeezing out to your amazement. I think you have found three fractures in the middle of the head according to this method:
And then extract the excess humidity; and then strengthen the fractures with draps and plasters; and then apply something on top for six days, and then remove the bandage and cure the wound with tentacles and unguents, and strengthen the head in equality; eat the patient with dry food of little humidity until the member is comforted and healthy.
And there is another method of incision, which considers how to appear the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water, because some veins are more in the occiput, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and then attend to the incision so that the abscess appears and the water is replenished, and do it according to what is most possible for you.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and avoid those flowy veins of blood and marrow, lest the patient die from that flow of blood with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter three.
When you find some catarrh or rheum in the veins or on the feet, and it is antiquated, and does not confer on that the cure of medicines, then the last cure is to make an incision on those two arteries.
And then know when you want to incise those that the patient's vein is near the head, and then clean the place with a sharp drap for so that the arteries appear, and then strengthen the neck of the patient with some drap; and then consider the pulse of the vein; and the places on each of them above the places which are close to the auricles, and so they are hidden until in some homes.
And then place a thread above the artery with a tent, and then incise each one in the space of each part of the head, making an incision penetrating into the bone, and it is so for the latitude of the head.
And if you want, enter the space below the artery and cut through to the incisions at the top parts.
And it is the length of the incision that measures two digits adjusted, because when a vein is incised, the blood flows out in pulsating egress, which bursts forth frequently before calming down.
But if the artery does not appear at the incision site, then know that you measure from the auricle the quantity of the space of three digits, and then place a thread with a tent, and make it enter into the bone.
And it is known that one gets rid of the blood flow which is a quantity of six ounces. and it is far from getting more or less, and all that is according to the quantity which appears of the virtue of the patient and of the replenishment of the artery of it.
And then consider the wound, and if there remains on the bone some cause of the cyanosis, then incise that so that no abscess is formed cautiously.
And then strengthen the wound with plasters and bandages of cloth, and then cure it with unguents until it is healthy.
Chapter 3.
On the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When some ancient or chronic catarrh flows, due to humid aggravations and quality in the veins of the temples, or an old vehement and similar thing, and it is medicated with various methods of medical cure, but it does not confer, then we have proceeded to extract the arteries from the temples, or cauterization of those thus as we have shown.
And the method of operation and extraction of those is that the patient's vein is near the skin which is in the temples; and it tends to the apparent artery in the temple because it is shown to you by the pulse, and it is hidden until in few homes due to the vehemence of the flow.
And if it is hidden, then the neck of the patient should be strengthened with some cloth; and then clean the place with a sharp drap or evaporate the place with hot water until the artery appears manifestly to you. And then you take the space of which this is the form: And then you score the cord with which this is facilitated until you reach the artery; and then get onto it and extract it from the superior parts until you extract it from the cord and discover it from the tunics which are beneath it, of the entire part.
But if the artery is subtle, then envelop it at the extremity of the ounce, and then incise that one part according to the quantity for which the extremities of it are lengthened and contracted, and there will be no flux of blood, because if it is not incised, the blood will not flow at all.
And then evacuate the blood from the vicinity of the affected area. Enter three drops.
And if the acidity is great, then it is necessary to lie down in two places with a double strong bandage or with long cords, and do not touch the putrid matter during the consolidation of the wound and ending the flow of blood.
And then incise the excess which is between two ligaments; and do it at that hour or then another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize that with a cautery into the bone, or with a cutting cautery into which the extremities of it are incised, and stay in place of that same work.
And it is better work because the patient has fever or is of complex composition; for cautery is among those causes that help to end humidity, and therefore it is better in youth.
And it is necessary to extract the acidity that fills the place of the old wound, and then pause decently on the dust, and then be cured with dry medicines that make the flesh and bones healthy within so that it may be sanitized.
And if meanwhile you work on another occasion to stop the flow of blood from the acidity, then you touch to restrain that blood, or with a cautery, or that fills the place of the wound, and stretch your hand within so that the blood is restrained. And if none of those causes is present to you, then pause your finger on the place within so that the blood is congealed, and wet the place with water of vehement coldness within so that the acidity repose, and be strengthened according to what is necessary.
And that which is more suitable in the extraction of acidity is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two points, since you have touched the two places with tension, and pause somewhat, not much, within so that they penetrate to the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that it may be elongated that which is between the extremities of it, because they are not consolidated at all with this cautery.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And the acidity of the two points is tempered. Perhaps it is better to temper the acidity with two points, because if you agitate them with two points properly towards each friction, and do not incise the flesh with velocity.
So since there is some grossness in those, it has held the heat of fire in those and the flesh is more quickly abscessed.
And this work is better in all works and more suitable.
And the space which is between two points is the quantity of the grossness of the finger.
Fourth chapter.
On the cure of bodies of sharp and acidic humors of the veins.
When the veins are acidic, and it is the body of those veins which are above the head before falling, and do not find in that any cause of the cure by medicine, and sometimes the face of the patient already turns red and feels on the dry front of walking thus as if they were walking with ants, and the veins of that one are so exhausted, humidifying thus that already their skin is worn out, and the eyelids are so scalded by the acidity of the tears, the ancient wise masters in the cure of those of this operation, and I do not remember that cure in space.
And it is that you command the patient to walk with the skin which is on the dry front, and then incise in the front three fissures equally distant according to the length of the front. And if the length of the fissure falls into two digits: one fissure is equally distant to the length of the nose in the middle place of the front, and the second according to the length of a small movement of the eyelids which are in the lacrimal, and the third of the other part.
And beware of the beginning of the acidities which are in two sides, and elongate your hand from the continuity of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the quantity of three digits adjusted.
And if you have a piece of spongy material prepared or dry cloths that absorb the blood.
And then insert the spatula of two sharp extremities, of which this is the shape of the incision: which is from the partition of the temples within to the second incision. Extract all that code which is between two incisions with the siphon which is above the bone, and then do it from the incision to the middle within to the second incision. And then straighten this spatula and insert it into the first incision another time with another instrument which is called a cutter, having one part sharp and the other not sharp.
And pause the side of that sharp part towards the adjacent flesh of the code, and the side of it to the bone, and apply it within so that it reaches the middle fissure, and abscesses all those veins that descend from the head to the veins.
It is necessary to continue the incision at that point to make an opening in the hollow of the knee joint, and then make it in the same way into another opening.
Then pour a certain quantity of warm water, expressing the places of the swollen veins of the blood congealed.
And stop in each hot opening of the hip joint, and place on those swollen veins embedded with wine and oil, and take care not to inflame the aposteme with a cauterized instrument.
And on the third day, loosen the ligature and administer a great abundance of warm water or decoction, and then take care to anoint with basilicon oil and rose oil, and others, so that the wounds may be healed.
Chapter 5.
On the treatment of ulcers caused by catarrh and those descending from the injured parts of the head.
When there is an acute catarrh and it continues, and sometimes the ulcers of the patient's thighs are greatly extended, and already their eyesight is weakened, and their eyelids are ulcerated and because of this their skin is rough, and in the forehead of the head there is sharp pain and subsequent exhaustion, then you will know by these accidents that the materials and catarrh do not come except from many veins of the injured parts proceeding.
And the best cure for these is this: that you order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in a certain opening at the middle of the forehead, a small one for the width (and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and make it straight into the bone; and stretch out your hand from the tendons of the temples which are numb from the mastigation), until the bone is uncovered.
Dry out all the blood with a sponge or with dry cloth and then replace it between the two lips of the incision with hot hip joint or with dry cloths. And then strengthen beneath the swollen veins embedded with wine and oil, so that they do not inflame the post-operative wound with a cauterized instrument.
And when you see that the aposteme has already diminished, then it is time to scrape the bone until it begins to form new flesh, and then take care to apply a regiment of dry poultices which make the flesh heal, thus as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophonum and mix them together, and make a plaster and apply it to these wounds on the native flesh.
Chapter 6.
On the treatment of those that fall into the ears.
The entire cause that falls into the ears is one of four species, either it is mineral pebbles or a cause similar to pebbles, thus like iron and vein, or it is from a plant thus like cress or fava, or it is a fluxible cause thus like water and wine agree and their similarity, or some beast.
And then when pebbles fall into the ear or another cause similar to those causes that do not adjust in the ear, and stop the ear from the sun, and if times the pebbles, then distill in some oil of violet or sizami, and then administer the extraction of it, and make the storming with a condiment, and open the nostrils for the arrival of the storming. And then stop in the circle of the ear with some pieces of cloth or wool, and extend the ear to the upper parts, because many evacuated matters are forgotten in these causes.
And if it is not evacuated, then administer the extraction of it with the instrument called gesti epicicarios subtiles, of which this is the form:
And if it is forgotten in the gestures, well; and if not, then administer the extraction of it with an instrument of subtle touch of little duplication.
And then if it is not forgotten by that, then make a canal of silver and insert the extremity of the canal into the tube of the ear and close the environment of the canal with wax and oil softened so that nothing comes out except the canal. And then extract it with the tender vein which has strong attraction, because many evacuated matters have been recounted with water that they had.
If it is not forgotten in this manner, then take alum bat or prepared viper's bugloss which has pressed the wings with a small quantity, and stop that at the extremity of the ray, and then envelop it decently paused. And then insert that into the tube of the ear facilitated, and then dry the ear of humidity.
And then if it is not forgotten in all the causes which we have recounted, then you will take care to remove that from the teeth so that it does not inflame the post-operative wound with a cauterized instrument or spasm.
And the manner of removing that is that you at the beginning dry the patient's vein of the cephalic vein and extract the blood according to the manner of the virtue of it, and then make a circle between your hands and convert the ear to the upper parts, and find a small opening in the root of the ear where the veins of it are previously gathered. If the fracture of a lunar figure enters into the knee, and the knee is bruised, or it is necessary to apply an appropriate instrument; and apply it to the fracture at that hour with velocity, and cure it so that it may be healthy.
And if the cause of the pain is in the ear and it's one of the fat that grows and inflates, then administer the cure and extraction of it; but if you do not obey your own judgment, then take a subtle spatula according to this form: and administer to that the absorption of that fat which has fallen into the ear.
And do not think that it is humidified by the vapor of the ear, and stop it with gentle touches, and extract it from those corners or gestures subtly, or by subtle injection, as it has been said, because the extraction of it is alleviated.
But in the water that has entered into the ear, because the patient uses sternutation to facilitate the commencement, and fills the whole ear with a lot of liquid, and pours it over the ear where the water is, and if by chance it is forgotten, be it; and otherwise, take three or four tender fingers according to the length of the digit, and place them in the focus of a little opening, and the patient inserts one of those into the channel of their ear and sounds above one finger of that party and percussionates with another finger on the finger which is behind the ear. Then stop pouring water into the ear until all the water has been forgotten.
Then stop pouring water into the ear until all the water has been forgotten. And when the water is forgotten, then you take pieces of paper or of cotton. and place one extreme end of it in the ear and extend the other extreme end into the focus until it is combined with the mucus of it.
And also place another cotton and make so many turns until all the water is forgotten, and draw it out with a canal just as it has been said about the extraordinary ear.
But in the extraction of beast entering into that ear, if it is a small thing, then push and pull it out similarly, cure it just as we have said in the division; but if it is a large thing which causes apparition at the time of vehement movement, then administer the extraction of it with gestures and corners, and the cause of it is purer than all other causes that happen in the ear.
But in the extraction of worms engendered in the ear, when you cure it with water as we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and do not confuse your cure, then it is necessary that you expose the ear to the sun.
And so if some cause of worms appears here, then extract it with gestures or subtle corners, but if no cause appears, then take a straight and narrow canal and draw out the abundance of which this is the form: And insert the subtle extremity into the ear according to the quantity which the patient can bear; and apply suction with water for strong sucking, and make many turns, until all the worms are forgotten.
But if you do not obey your own judgment, then operate and close the circuit of the canal with wax just as we have said; then administer distillations which have already been experienced by the ancients in the cure of worms, and find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion be the one in which you pour medicinal oils into the ear with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or copper, straight, in which there is a small hole, and placed thus.
And so it is how they fill the cavity of the canal, where it will be necessary to continue here. And if you want, take the radish and wrap it decently in the extremity of the canal, and apply a gentle oil in the cavity of the instrument, or juice of some herb, or whatever you want of these medicines in the canal — and that is in the ear —, and then insert the radish with gentle pressure and express your hand so that the oil is expelled from the cavity of the instrument and the patient feels the oil dripping.
And what has been poured into the ear should be warmed in a little focus. And beware that the cause which you distilled into the ear is not too frequent, because ear medicines do not bear that.
Chapter 7.
On the Cure of Opilation of Ears.
Some turns of certain enfantized yeast, which are not perforated, and that has already accumulated in some homes, opilation occurs in the middle of the ear due to plague or carnation in that; and this opilation is made in the prison of the ear's channel, which does not consent to vehement movement, and some turns are in the parts beforehand.
And that which occurs in the chest of the patient, which does not comprehend the vein's movement, is in the major dispositions of difficult healing.
And in that which follows the vein's movement, it is necessary that you hold the patient's ear to the sun and look at that. And then if the apparent oppression sometimes occurs, observe that subtle spatium of which this is the shape of it:
If the extremity of it is in which small width, of which one part is acute and the other not; and the spatium is of two lion's widths so that it does not touch the ear.
And then if the oppression is due to a birthmark on the ear or in the marrow of it, then you have subtly and vehemently facilitated an entrance so that the entire flesh is restored.
And if the oppression is in the chest of the ear, then take a subtle lion's root and scrape that focus into a little hole, and then place it in the marrow of the ear.
And then if you have felt oppression in that which the patient has facilitated, due to the gravity of ascent, it forces the oppression of it to be facilitated; and beware that you do not plague the nerves of the ear.
And then pause in the ear drip by drop according to the quantity of the width of the channel which you have enveloped in the Egyptian ointment; and do that for several days until you are sure of the consolidation of the plague; or take some water and pour it into a jug and pulverize over the affected area and use it; and if the ear is already apostemed, then it is necessary that you extract the water and permute it with another water which you will envelop in wax so that it is made with oily roasting, until it is the aposteme cured; and then cure it until it is healthy.
Maybe it occurs a flow of blood, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and pause over the ear, and use another cure which restrains the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
On the cure of athelia, which falls upon the eyelids.
Athelia which falls upon the eyelids of the eyes, some of which are humid, some of which are dry.
Then it is necessary that you hold those with tenacious or pointed nails, and anoint those with the essence of their roots, and then pause over the affected areas.
Maybe if pain with a flow of blood comes, then you cauterize those with a subtle, linear cautery.
And the best cauterization is to return the incisions and dry wounds when some cause of their roots remains; and when they are cauterized in focus, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Cure of cataracts that come to the eyelids of the eyes.
Moist humors collect in the eyelids of the eyes for some cause which is assembled with grandeur in its strength and hardness, and thus grandeur is called.
And it is an addition of gross humidity in the upper and lower eyelids.
Then the operation in them is that you consider then if the grandeur proceeds from it in that which appears from the eyelid and is magnified to the entire part; and the cause of it is laziness.
Then make a fissure about that with width, and then scrape it from the entire part to facilitate until it evaporates, and then suspend it in a pointed instrument and separate it.
And if the figure is large, then you adjust it with a suture; and cure that until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will not overcome evil by that which the angle of it restores and incarnates.
And if the grandeur is declining to the inner parts of the eyelid from the inner surface, then you evacuate the eyelid and suspend the grandeur in a pointed instrument, unless you indicate an incision, and press it from the entire part, and if the eyelid by incision is prolonged, that does not appear in any cause.
And then make an incision, wash the eye with salt water; and cure the area with that which incarnates until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
On the cure of abscesses in the lower eyelid of the eye.
Abscesses are gray things which are engendered in the tunics of the lower eyelid, and they increase among infants, aggravate the eyes of those who have them, and cloud their clarity so that they cannot gaze at the brightness of the sun because the lachrymal glands become stuck to them.
And thus you often find them gazing at their faces for a long time, and at their faces while sleeping; and so on the lower eyelids of their eyes the humid eyebrows, which have already covered inflammation, and the imminence of apparent abscesses is in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel abscesses until they are apparent.
In some manual of operation it is necessary that the patient pause with his head in a certain position, and then place a cloth of linen or of a hot circle according to the quantity which contains the entire affected part, and then place that over that and press with fingers of the entire periphery so that an arc shape is formed in the middle of the circle, and then feel in the middle of that humidity accumulated incidentally in the fissure for the width, and the fissure should not be larger than the fissure which is made in phlebotomy.
Maybe in the preceding cavity you will find the entire code within which you reach to form an arc, because among the major deposits processes an arc for the fissure according to the shape of white crust.
Then extract that humor which you have enveloped between the fingers and toes of the affected parts beforehand and revolve between the right and left hand until it is dispersed.
And beware that you do not adjust in the fissure so that the humidity does not reach the vein and descends to that.
Maybe if the arc does not appear at the beginning of the fissure, maybe you adjust in the fissure a small facilitated humor until it processes an arc; and then extract that thus as we have said; and then submerge cloths of linen in water and wine and place them over the area and strengthen those humid powders.
And thus you will find that you draw out salt and place it in the cavity of the fissure so that what remains of that humidity is removed.
And then heal that until it is healthy.
Maybe if you find a post-apostemic abscess, then cure that with emplasters of Cedar oil until it is healthy.
Chapter 11.
On the manner of touching the vein.
When in the eyelids of the veins there are natural and ancient adjustments, then those nose towards the vein and make various kinds of evils, such as assiduous tears and mollification of the eyelids and skin until it is cause of destruction of the vein which is called touching of the vein, and it is cured in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with acute medicine according to what has been said in the chapter on cautery; or it is touched through incision and suture; or with canes as you will be directed.
And then it is necessary that you place the head of the patient in a certain position; then convert the eyelid of the vein with your left hand, and if it is converted, well; and otherwise, insert a needle in that where there is faith of the affected part beneath the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with faith from below, and it will be — near the margin of the eyelid where the veins are — near the veins, and pull the faith to the upper parts towards the eyelid, and convert that into a ray.
And then feel in the affected part within the eyelid beneath the adjusted veins with incident humidity of the major lachrymal into the minor lachrymal; and then extract the faith and place beneath the eyelid powdered powders of cotton or linen, and then apply a thread over the eyelid in a tent-like shape, and it will be thus like the figure of a leaf of myrtle.
Maybe in this way it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity of elevation of the eyelid, because then it has been diversified among men, because of those it is necessary that a great quantity be incidentally placed on the eyelid according to the quantity for which the eyelid is mollified.
And then feel with the humidity over the two lines which have been signaled, and begin from the major lachrymal into the minor lachrymal. And if your fissure is near the natural veins thus as it is the grossest part of the vein.
And then place the onguent in one of the two angles of the code, and then excavate that entire thing, and then adjust with the scissor the two labia on the gut or faith of subtle wool, and absorb the blood, and make adhere what superfluously falls from the faiths over two sponges for some envisioning causes, if you want to do it, and otherwise, don't cure.
And then leave the suture of the faiths for three days or four, and then cure that.
And if you want, leave the plague with its suture, and cure that with what dries and constrains, because the eyelid is elevated from the sigillation of the plague and the aggregation of it; maybe the suture is better. Therefore, I have thusly discussed the antiquities of taxanir.
Maybe in this way it is solicited over the patient, and it is a good operation, and it is not in fear.
And it is another manner in taxmir, and it is that you signal over the eyelid figure thus as a leaf of myrtle, and then elevate the eyelid with three separated and congregated inches according to this form.
Maybe if it is not possible to have the inches, and it is not engualhed, then take a needle in which there is faith and place that in the middle of the figure, and insert the other faith near the major lachrymal, and the faith according to the minor lachrymal, and adjust between the fingers the faiths in equality, and then elevate your hand with elevation engualhed, elevate the entire code over which it is signaled thus as we have recommended.
And then adjust the two lips of the wound to suture, and take care that the inside is healthy.
Perhaps you will hasten the ripening of your abscess or your fracture, but that abscess is at the cervix and it appears similar, and it is ulcerating.
And some evacuated humors descend to the eyelid which are converted into healthy skin, therefore it is good that you use those in that of the abscess we have spoken of; maybe suture in certain cases is more artificial.
You will prepare the remedies according to this method: and it is that you convert the eyelid and dissect the figure that is hidden according to what has been recounted; and then prepare two canals or two subtle asters of which the length will be according to the length of the eyelid and the width of theirs will be less than the width of the spatium. And you have incised in the extremities of certain divided parts, where you hold the threads.
Then add certain subtleties under what superfluously flows from the eyelid of the wheel, and construct the canals of certain divided parts with a strong structure, and lay it aside for some days, because the codena (codex?) for the morbid structure will be denied and it will be rejected until you place it in its proper seat.
Perhaps it is delayed, then cut through the three veins, and then take care of the wound until it is healthy.
Since it is consolidated, the eyelid is elevated and the skin does not prick.
And this is the method of two canals which you will make according to this form: and it has the quantity of the length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
On the elevation of pricking skin on the wheel when the skin is hard.
When the skin is unnatural, hard and rough, and pricks the wheels, then the operation on it is that you take subtle agula and pauses in that subtle vein of cedar and lion, and then adjust the extremities of it and move subtly in many ways. And it is the length of the veins of a quantity of one palm.
And then you will compose another subtle vein below it in brief, and join the extremities of that if you want.
And then stop the evil that is in the tieu, and it will be proper of the sun for your work to be declared, because it is a subtle and minute operation.
And then introduce the needle into the root of the adjusted skin which has needed to be engendered, and make it penetrate into the eyelid firmly until you extract it from under the natural skin.
And then pull the skin underneath and introduce it into the alloy, and they will be one or two or three skins, and not more.
And then pull your hand into that until the skin is forged-alloyed in the eyelid with the natural skin.
Perhaps it is not alloyed and the skin is not yet joined, you will alloy to the divided parts below in the vein which you have composed there, until it is fully alloyed above the traumatic wound.
And you will see it in the vision of the wheel, because then you will alloy and the vein, and you will grasp something and close the wheel, and leave the closure for two days or three, until the skin adheres to its own place and is born upon that good flesh.
And if the skin is more brief, then you adjust a long skin of natural skins, and it is elevated in that, or until it is lengthened properly into another space, and then you elevate it.
Chapter 13.
On the cure of extracting what is seen in the eyelid underneath.
When it is in the wheel extracting, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is constricted in its own, or in the right or left divided part, for bad consolidation of wounds or sections or cauteries, and it is called leporina, and this extraction is natural or accidental, and it is done for consolidation of wounds or sections or cauteries, or for resemblance to their malcurations.
There the manner of the operation on it is that you perform that consolidation and separate the lips of it, and pause in it where it is between those a certain amount of dryness of air, and bind them together until they are healthy.
And do not think that you will use the cure of it from the causes which dry it out, constraining; because if you do that, it returns to extracting worse than never having had it.
Use in that of causes which mollify thus as it is fenugrec, and embrocate with water in which are cooked altaea and semen of air, or inject dyaquilon, which liquefies in some of the oils, and submerge in that measure, and take care of that.
And the treasure of your cure is that you will perform it in all ingenium that is not consolidated according to the form that was at the beginning.
And in this operation which we have described, it is not but some kind of correction of the dislocation that does not return to the normal shape of the affected area according to the focus of the pain.
Chapter 13.
On the treatment of dislocation which is caused in the eyelid below.
This dislocation which is caused in the eyelid below, which is commonly called a "fallen eyelid"; and it is either some natural one, or another accidental one.
The accidental ones are caused by a blow or by a cut or by a cautery or by other similar things.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle and make a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pass from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread penetrates both extremities of the flesh.
And then stretch the flesh to the upper parts with the needle and pull it towards the needle, and insert it into the spatium in a wide amplitude. And thus the shape of the eyelid returns according to its natural form; but if not, take the thread and pass it through the divided figure, and with that convert the eyelid, and make two sutures on the edge of the lower eyelid.
And the extremities of the two sutures form two angles of the incision, which have been made so that they converge, and they are from their made angle so that when they come together they form a figure of theirs.
And this figure is a Greek letter: lambda.
And then remove the flesh for the quantity that is the width of the lower eyelid below it, so that you lift the eyelid.
And then adjust the separated parts and sew them with the thread of flax; and then treat them with what we have said about softening medicines and poultices, until they are healthy.
And if the dislocation is due to a fracture or suture or cautery, then it is necessary that you make a flat suture over the skin of the eyelid according to what has been previously described. And then separate the poultice between the two lips according to what we have said.
In the summary of the sermon on the treatment of dislocation when it is above or below, which runs through the operation, according to the form of dislocation that has been prepared, and this is in various diverse forms.
And the skilled craftsmen prepare everything in advance in whatever manner is possible to return the figure to its natural form, or near to it, and that malady according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments in the major dispositions.
Chapter 15.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many men in such a way that the eyelid is solidly stuck above on the white of the eye, and it is prohibited from the facility of movement and its natural functions, therefore it is necessary that you introduce the extremity of the thread below the eyelid, and lift it up, or stretch it towards the nail.
And then you insert the adhesion into a subtle spatium, which is not sharp from the incisions, having obtained an obtuse angle so that the malady is not disturbed by the operation, and remain with the spatium that does not touch the eye in its sharpness.
And thus your incision should be such that it removes that adhesion with facility, so that the eyelid returns to its natural form and all the adhesion is healed.
And then you put in the eye salt water in which you wash; or dissolve zinc oxide in the water.
And then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a poultice of milk, and place on the eye a flax seed infused in the white of an egg, and then use for three days causes that consolidate until it is healthy.
Chapter 16.
On the incision of a nail and prominence of flesh of the lacrimal glands.
You know that a nail is according to two manners, because it is either nervous, and resembles a thin, subtle ciphac; or it is non-nervous, resembling a white, congealed humidity, which when touched with the finger, or is forced to take on the nail, is separated and the nail does not stay in place.
And both species do not begin except from the major lacrimal gland until it goes little by little that covers the sight and prohibits the light and movement of the eye.
The manner of operating in the incision of it is that the malady places its own head in the tieu seat, and then operates on the eyes of it, and lifts the eyelid with its hand, and then collects the nail in the place of little duplicated extension and stretches it to the upper parts. And then take a needle and introduce it into a horse's hair or ox's or cow's, or similar things, or strong wire, or duplicate the extremity of the small needle little by little and place it in the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie it to the nail; and stretch it to the upper parts, and remove from the hair the width of the nail which is seen in the pupil. And thus you should follow that medicine into the patient's back towards the nape of their neck.
Then you should insert the remedy into the root of the lacrimal duct with a subtle spatula or small forceps, and lift the natural flesh of the lacrimal duct so that by inserting it no continuous flow of tears is hindered.
And sometimes the nail on the sole of the foot is extended or has a fissure, thus we have said, and then it should be excavated with a lion's spatula, which is the shape of it.
And beware that you do not touch the corneal tunic with the spatula and that it does not cause a rupture, and that the pupil is not perforated.
Then insert the gutta into the wound a little salt powder or of clear serum, and let it be inside for another day; and then take care that the water that covers the wound is sanctified.
And if the nail is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it fixed in that joint, then many weakened specimens of this type of nail are cured with medicines, and they are healed thus, as I have written and recommended in the division.
And if you want to insert it, then open the wound of the patient and take a subtle lion's spatula of sharp edge, according to this form. with subtlety. And if sometimes it is rarefied and congealed and enters into the root, then distill from your work in the wound of clear serum or of clear blood or of salt powder, and apply the wound for another day.
And then iterate over that operation until everything that is of it is removed, so that the contrary abscess does not remain in the wound, because then you will leave that, and take care at the beginning to remove the abscess until it is healed.
And then iterate your operation on that root until it is healed.
The prominence of the lacrimal flesh, if it is noted in the wound for great annoyance, should be suspended with an onion; and insert that into a partition, and do not finally insert it so that no continuous flow of tears is hindered.
And then distill into the lacrimal clear blood and clear serum until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
On the insertion of almond-like remedies and of what is born from adjusted flesh in the wound.
Some weakened specimens in the wounds of some people are born from raw flesh, and it is superimposed until it covers the pupil, or approaches or stretches over the eyelids and strongly compresses the eyelids to the parts before and is assembled like a rose of balconet.
The operation on it is that the patient holds their head in the bandage; and then open the wounds of that and collect all that flesh with convenient onions, and you have a forceps or a chest; and then insert the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished in the incision, and beware of the wound that does not deviate from your operation.
And it is your insertion into which you insert those or with the spatula that we have recommended in the insertion of the nail, or small forceps which are collected according to what will be seen later in this chapter.
When your insertion is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the wound with salt powder, or distill into the red powder and apply it to the wounds of corrosive medicines, and place over the wound before, covered with a dressing of egg whites until it is assured against abscess.
And if some cause of almond-like remedies is sinewed with holy abscess, and fears abscess, then leave the wound and take care of that abscess in what cedes that abscess, and then iterate over that operation until it is healed, and similarly make a just-adjusted flesh that accides in the wound of this species.
But you should cover that everything is totally cured of the wound freely by natural way or by accidental way, opening with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that that member is sufficiently suffering from that operation.
Chapter 18.
On the collection of sabur in the wound.
Sabur comes with red veins which are tested over the wound and prohibit its healing, and they develop the wound in length of days.
Then it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the wound in which there is sabur is strong and in it there is no other malady except sabur, then you collect that sabur.
And it is that you command the patient to hold their head in the bandage, and then suspend those veins with an onion or two according to your prudence; and let that onion be of subtle duplication according to this form.
or two onions gradually in a container according to this form.
And then collect those veins with subtle forces, with subtlety, and abstain from the holy hour to hour, until you see that those veins are removed from the wound and are turned around.
Be careful that you do not let the vein at the extremities of the spatula; and if your operation is during the morning, before the sun, and be very firm in your operation so as not to incise except those veins.
When you have completed it, then distill in the chief vein either green or red for that which is corroded, so that it removes the rust from the saber.
Maybe it is not possible to collect everything at that hour, and then apply a poultice to all that which ceases the pain of it, and let it be for some days until the pain of it is appeased and assuredly protected from postrema caution.
And then iterate over it according to the method that masters the manual therapy until it is healed.
And this is the form of the fractures:
Chapter 19.
On the reduction of aristotelian nasal polyps.
When you treat aristotelian nasal polyps with cautery or acute burning medicine, according to the narration that precedes it and it is not healed, then it is not engendered in it except that you focus on the postrema of the disease, and extract all the humidity which is in it until the bone is discovered.
And then when the bone is discovered and sometimes it is in corruption or blackness, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a rough head, and it is made of iron indeed, and it is the redon head thus as one makes the which is pointed for pointing with lime or alkali for subtle pointing (thus as it is in the following form).
And pause that over the corrupted bone location, and then revolve it among the fingers of the diseased, and press your small hand little by little until you know that the corruption is removed.
And then some evacuations are made, and then restore the location with causes of desiccative and styptic remedies.
Then if the location is consolidated and it is in good flesh born and the body is absolved from the sane and Roman routine for 40 days, and it is not renewed and not apostemated and does not happen in the accident, then you know that it is healed.
And thus, then it is not in the engendering except to reduce the fissure to the form of the nose, and according to this method: that you discover from second bone or acute medicine, and when the bone is discovered, then you take trio according to this form:
It is the extraction of the triangular iron, and the foundation of it is primarily extended to the extremity thus as sometimes thus.
And then pause that over the bone, and it is that of the lacrimal; and lengthen your hand a little from the vein, and then revolve your hand with the trio until it penetrates all the bone, and that feels the patient for as long as it arrives to be well, so that you know when your hand is well.
Then restore the location with styptic and desiccative medicines, thus as you have experienced it.
Then since the flesh and location are indurated, then the matter which was poured out to the parts before returns to the nose, so that is why it is easier to relieve the patient.
Chapter 20.
On the reduction of the prominence of the vein.
When the vein emerges in its entirety and does not occur with nocturnal movement or diminution, then it is necessary to lax the patient, and then follow, and then pause on the cervical scarifications and suck for good suction; and then pause over the vein with a liniment made of acatra and aloe and incense and sarcocolla, and then strengthen the poultice over the vein with many powders.
And the method of the powders is that you take drapes of the many lions' powder, and each drape is duplicated in four places; and make it from those powders.
And then pause those one over the other according to the quantity of which the vein has need. And then strengthen over those with a hard, strict structure; and iterate the suction cups on the scarifications; and then remove the suction cups and let the vein be straightened during the day and night.
Maybe sometimes the ligament is mollified, then it is necessary to make it very straight.
And then remove the ligament during the day and night thus as we have said.
And if sometimes the vein is not reduced, well, and thus, then iterate the poultice with powders and structure and suction cups until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On the incision of the prominence of the tunicate vein.
When you make a disruption in the tunicate vein, and then it is prominent and proceeds outward through the eyelids thus as a grain of radish, and its form is ornamented for that, and you want to incise, then the operation on it is thus as we have recommended, that you insert the needle at the root of the vein of the lower part below in the upper part, and then put the other needle in which is double fil from the lacrimal part, and make that penetrate and let the first needle follow according to its disposition; and then incise the location of the double filet and lift it from that part of the vein in the circle of the needle, and strengthen that much.
And then extract the thorn and place it on the swollen vein filled with humor, and let the flow of blood come out through the opened passage.
And then heal the vein in that which comforts the inside so that the wound may be healthy.
Some evacuated veins of the entire affected area around the circle of the thickened vein, and then are perforated in the subtle spatium that comes to the head of the vein, and correct the albuginean humidity, and descend the vein and enter as soon as possible.
And then strengthen it so that it may be healthy.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of ulcers.
This disease that is called ulcer does not exist, but rather it is a sane vein similar to descending water and not that one.
The way to operate on it is to make the ulcer sit above the prepared seat and straighten, and then take the dry head in your hands more than two parts and mau that inside so you see the sane vein pervading to the lower parts, and then it becomes dry and does not descend, and remains stuck in the light, and the ulcer sees the causes thus as it was.
And if it does not descend below, you will know that it is water.
But if the descent to the vein is not prepared as we have said, then make the ulcer sit between your hands and take a subtle spatium and spin it over the panniculus surrounding a small part of the continuation of the conjunctiva in the corneal tunics (in the place you see), so that the vein may be forgotten.
Then when it is forgotten, then you distill the vein of hot water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugrec and honey.
And then it will be healed for the other causes so that it may be healthy.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of descending water from the vein.
We have said the species of water in the division and which ones are convenient to perforate in the declared sermon, then that second according to sanity.
Then it is necessary that you make the ulcer sit between your hands on a chair and bind the vein tightly with a strong knot.
And then pause near the eyelid of your vein, your left hand if the vein is on the left; or your right hand, if the vein is on the right.
And then take with your right hand the blade, if the vein is on the left; or with your left hand, if the vein is on the right.
And then pause the extremity of the blade near the crown for the greatness of the radius in the vein's album on the part of the tear lake, and then insert the blade in the vertex and turn your hand in that.
And then penetrate into the vein's album and feel that the blade has already reached the desired cause.
And it is necessary that the measurement of the path of the blade at the point of the space which is from the pupil into the end of the blackness, and it is the crown of the vein; because you will see in that pupil with the vision of the vein through the clarity of the corneal tunics.
And then pause the blade into the place where the water is, and then you will attract it below a evacuated vein, and so if the water descends soon, then you will see the ulcer that has been treated above the vein, and the blade in your vein.
And then rest for a little while; so if the water has descended, then you will stop that other vein before the blade is touched.
And so when it is dry and does not descend, then you extract the blade with ease, and turn your hand a little at a time, and dissolve in the water a small amount of clear salt from gemstone and in that lava the vein deduces; and then pause outside the vein or stop or anoint with oil of rose and album of humor and ligature around the vein itself.
But we, those who are of our time, pause over that which is written in the album of humor.
And if you do not obey your blade to the instrument of the vein for its durability — because it is a virtue of the men whose vein is very hard —, then it is necessary that you take the spatium which is called albared, of which this is the form:
And then perforate in that conjuncture, and do not exceed your hand in the trajectory, and it is not so that you make a way to the blade in a subtle place.
And then insert the blade according to what we have said.
And receive the complement of your work, be prepared for the ulcer to sleep descendingly made on which it sleeps above the two veins in a dark maison, and be prohibited from all movements.
And pause in the nature of that water so that its nature is aligned, and do not move the vein's head to the right or left part of anything.
It should be treated according to its disposition within three days.
And then expose that in the dark room and clear the free view, and make the veins appear for some causes, and then return the treatment within seven days.
And do not cover that you make in the hour of the cures or almost then return to the infusion. Having covered that you remove it for thus the water pushes gently but greatly and vehemently in regard to the regimen.
Perhaps it happens that an abscess bursts, then cover that you extract the vein from the seventh day, and correct that which remains of the abscess.
Then you absolve the sight of it and pause on the oral face for which the regulation of its evacuation is done through some days, it exists in the dark room.
And then it will be extracted from that dark room gradually and converted into its causes.
And you know that in the chapter it is not excused to omit certain visions, and then you will be ardent about the operation.
And now it has arrived at our knowledge of certain things which are according to the Art, and it is said that they make fire in the Ayroc magma perforated where the water succeeds.
Perhaps Emperor, you have not seen anything like this in our land which has perfected it, nor is it written in the books of the ancient authors; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the species of magma for which it is above those, that which ignores those:
And they are made of iron or of their own proper material, and they are the extremities of their arm in this subtle triangular shape, the acute extremity thus as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
On the cure of flesh wounds in the nose.
When in the nose there are born diverse adjusted flesh growths from which some cause is assembled to scorpion-like motions of many feet, or to a polyp foot; and this illness is called polyp because it has a resemblance to that foot represented. And of it is cancerous flesh, rough, of dark color; and of it is that it is not lion's flesh of dark color.
Therefore in that which is among these lion's flesh not fraudulent nor cancerous, cover that you make the evil exit between your hands and place it in the sun, and warm the nostrils of it, and prick the tender part of those flesh. And then extract that from the previous parts, and then inscribe what you have comprehended of those I have spat out subtly from one part within which you know that all flesh is already ostensible; because if it remains of any cause from which the abscession is possible, then you will return to the one of the subtle instruments facilitated within which none of the causes remain. Perhaps it happens that the abscess bursts, then you pause at what covers; or it is of the malignant apostemes, then you touch and cauterize that within which it is abscessed sane and all the cavities are opened.
And then it will be cut in the nose, then the incision will agree with water or wine. Perhaps the nose is open and of its processes humidity enters into the palate, then you know that it is already healed.
Perhaps the humidity does not penetrate as it covers, then you know that it is flesh born in the purulent ulcers of the nostrils which have not reached abscession.
Therefore then cover that you insert a thread of the same quality, and sew in the foot joints, and pause between each joint the quantity of the digit or month, and engineer the evil and insert one extremity of the thread into the nostrils with the radius or another cause which is possible.
And then it will be done, that the thread of the ornament enters into the channels of the nostrils, and it is established on the thread of the galleon, because many visions seem similar to this action, and it is a gentle cause for him who wants to do it.
And then pause the two extremities of the thread, one extremity that is above the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and then administer serrature of flesh on the joints that are in the thread, and make it enter until you know that the flesh is already in the joints of the thread.
And then extract the thread, and pause in the nose according to the abstraction of the healthy skin a little, and make it so for three days or more until the enguient is corrupted all that is removed from the flesh.
And then at the end of the cause, pause in the nose a tube of lead for some days until it is healed.
Perhaps there are ends of cure that exist, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument to purge the head, which makes distilled oils and medicines in the nostrils.
And if you make use of silver or iron, which resembles a small lantern inserted, thus with a small tube, and the meat similarly.
And if you want, make a closed canal thus with a tube, and the handle of the instrument is at the tip, plain, uncovered; which is held in the back of it, with which you hold that which you want to suck out of it or what you want of the juices and causes that flow.
Chapter 25.
They are born naturally in the extremities of the nose.
Polyps grown are born naturally in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnificent and mentioned in certain days within which a mouth is readied for its observation.
And by means of that you examine what appears at the beginning of its appearance, and you eradicate all of it. Then place a pause on the area or apply a burning medicine which was previously in its place.
If the ulceration is delayed within which it is magnificent, then consider if it is lapified, hard, of dark color and of little sentiment, then do not touch that with iron quar it is a cancerous aposteme; for polyps grown are added to that which ulcerates this great malice above that which it had.
And if the aposteme is of a Leon touch and not of dark color, and sometimes the ulceration is possible in all that, then evacuate the patient and ulcerate without fear, and cure the area with water that exhales and constrains until it is sanctified.
Chapter 26.
About the suture of the nose and of the lips and of the ear when the continuity is dissolved by plague or by resemblance.
You know that when you make a solution of continuity in one of these cartilages, few confer with that operation except in certain homes.
Therefore, when you find some cause of those, consider if it is fresh plague with holy saint, and then adjust the two lips of the plague to suture, and afterwards cure that until it is sanctified.
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each one is made healthy, then it is necessary that you extract each part of its apparent code until it becomes holy. And then adjust the two lips to suture and strengthen them, and on them sprinkle holy dragon's powder and three times, and place on the powder a piece of fine emplastrum diafinicon, or some other of the consolidated emplasters, and let it lie for two days or three, and then remove that and change that emplaster and let it lie until the wounds are fully closed, and then cure with an ointment until it is sanctified.
The manner of the suture is that you add the solution of continuity or with needles thus as we have recommended in the suture of the belly, or add the solution of continuity with thread thus as you and make it known.
Chapter 27.
About the extraction of those causes that come in the two lips in the divided parts.
Polyps grown are found in some homes in the divided parts of their lips, certain apostemes hard resembling fat errors, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, you convert the lips and find each one of those hardnesses in all parts, and then the abscess fills the place of holy trinity until the saint is restored, and then it is washed with a gentle agreement and the area is cured with water that is stipulated, until it is sanctified.
Chapter 28.
About the ulceration of the flesh adjusted on the gums.
A great number of polyps born above the adjusted flesh of the gum, which the ancient doctors called albulus, therefore it is necessary that you suspend that with an onion or that you hold that with forceps and ulcerate that from its root, and let the healthy blood flow or the saint.
And then pause on the holy place of the Trinity or other stipulated powders or excitatives.
And if that flesh returns, then ulcerate it secondarily, and cauterize it, because then the cautery will not return.
Chapter 29.
About the root of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth in the divided parts and of those from the mouth and between the adjusted gums, there are rough, bitter, and some polyps are blackened and are made citrine or green until the gum is corrupted by that and the teeth are loosened.
Therefore, you must make the patient sit between your knees and place their head on your thigh, and feel with your fingers to see if there are any hardened areas or signs of congestion in the veins that may be causing the pain, and this is due to the black bile and citrinitation and other inward disturbances that have become mondified.
So if it is established that the cause is in those of the beginning of the reasoning, then it is; and if not, then you will continue the reasoning on another day and the second and the third day until you come to the last statement in what you want.
And you know that the fingers need various movements of different forms and shapes according to how they are prepared for your operation. And for this reason the razor has the quality of being sharp at the point of separation from the teeth, which is different from the razor that is rough between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of razors should be prepared in a way that you will see soon.
Chapter xxx.
On the eradication of teeth.
Because you cure the tooth of its pain in all respects and delays in total eradication of it, since there is no cause that supplies the evacuation of it when it is eradicated, because it is a sublime substance that excuses itself in the eradication of it.
Moreover, because the patient is forced to eradicate that tooth, you should be firmly certified of which tooth is painful, since many evacuations alleviate the pain and convince the patient that it is a healthy tooth, and you eradicate it and then the pain does not cease until the bad and painful tooth is eradicated, for we have already seen this through the operation of the barbers.
Then how can you be certain which tooth is painful, and what you know, then it is necessary that you scarify around the circuit of the tooth with a spatulum in which there is some virtue, until it is dissolved from the tooth to the gum of the entire part, and then those teeth are loosened, or subtle forceps at the beginning little by little until that concudes.
And then apply force with strong pincers for good articulation or sturdy extraction, and place the patient's head between your thighs so that you hold it firmly without wavering, and then extract the tooth according to rectitude in a way that you do not tremble, nor does the patient experience major pain.
And so if it is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments, and place it beneath the entire part to facilitate and force the removal of it, just as it was done at the beginning.
Moreover, if the tooth is traumatized or corroded, then it is necessary that you complete the drawing of the root and strengthen it at the extremity of a subtle file so that it is not trapped during the time of your constriction over it with pincers.
And it is necessary that you operate with great precision in the scarification around the entire part of the gum and guard much your strength so that you do not tremble and remove a part of it, and return to the patient for the malice that is greater than the primary pain of it.
And beware that you do not do what foolish ignorant barbers do in their ignorance and audacity over the eradication of teeth, as they do not administer what we have recommended; for many evacuations come over the bad teeth, which are more difficult to extract, and the roots of those teeth remain entire, or some of them, or that you extract those teeth with some bones of the jawbone, just as many evacuations have testified.
And then the eradication of it is washed with mouthwash or vinegar or salt solution.
And if there is excessive bleeding for some time, just as many evacuations have done, then sprinkle a certain quantity of powder and aspersion on the wound, and if it does not stop that bleeding, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and pincers should be subtle, those which are used to extract teeth at the beginning, with a long handle, short and thick, so that they do not become doubled when you need to operate.
And it is also like this with thick handles until when you are experienced with them they do not become doubled, being short and extricated.
And they are made of Indian steel, expertly crafted with extracted handles, and in the extracts of those teeth, some enter into others and are strengthened by strong construction, and some evacuations have the shape of a bird's beak, which is called cicinia, so it is guaranteed, and they are of strong construction.
Chapter xxxi.
On the eradication of teeth and extraction of bones from the jaws that are locked.
When you need to eradicate a tooth that is locked in some cause, then it is necessary that you pause on the spot with a border for a day or two until the spot becomes mollified; and then insert the instruments or pincers, which are assembled like a bird's beak called cicinia or guarantee, in the shape of forceps.
The external parts of the body are often affected thus, as if by a similar imbalance or defect.
And if you do not obey your own judgment and use forceps or tongs, then be careful that you do not scrape the skin and cut into the entire flesh, and introduce the instrument which has the name of atali, so it is a small lever whose form is this.
It should be a short, thick extremity, and not bent in such a way that it does not become tangled.
Therefore, if the skin is scratched open, well; and if not, help yourself with other instruments of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is a triangular extremity in which there is some thickness.
The form of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and have a more subtle extremity.
And thus you will be helped with this instrument having two slants of which this is the form, suitable for the following. and with other instruments which precede in the filing of teeth; because you will be making it with this instrument which is assembled on a large hook, and this is the form.
of the triangular extremity, curved or short, which has some thickness, and not bent in such a way that it does not become tangled.
And you will know that the instruments for teeth are moved thus and similarly to the other instruments.
The skilled craftsmen are wise and subtle in their art, attentive to the material according to what it signifies, and the various illnesses; because they are among the illnesses for which the ancients did not design or pause to create proper instruments, due to the forms of diverse species.
Moreover, if the bone of the jaw or other bones of the mouth are tangled, or if they are loose, then it should be carefully corrected in their place, where it is convenient for the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help yourself with a gesture whose form is this.
And it should be with some small thickness, little by little, and held or tied in the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until all the bone is scratched open; and then restore the place with convenient medicines suitable for that.
Moreover, if there is small pus in the bone, then remove that from the pus and its blackness, and cure it until it is healthy.
Chapter 32.
On the care of teeth prominent above the others.
When the teeth are prominent and not according to their natural form, it is ugly, and especially when it comes to women, and especially to venerable old women; therefore, be careful that you consider: if a tooth is not in proportion to another tooth, and it is not possible to file or polish it, then root out that one; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you will extract it with this instrument whose form is this; and it is similar to a pig's bite, and made of Indian iron of extremely sharp extremity.
And it should be your extraction with which you extract it in three days for the hardness of the tooth, and that it does not communicate with other teeth.
And if it is a prominent tooth exposed to filing, then file it with a file of Indian iron whose form is this.
And it should be all of Indian iron and the margin is thus; and it should be of many small points thus like a file in which they are made agitated, in which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with facility, so that there is no other tooth communicating and adhering. And then bind it with thread, and remove it with sharp razors.
And if it is a tooth of which one part is tangled and holds the tongue, then be careful that you free it until the aspiration of that fraction is stopped and enclosed, and it should be applied so that the tongue does not lead or the speech does not corrupt.
Chapter 33.
On the restoration of teeth with gold wire or silver.
When it happens to the teeth in front of concussion and removal by percussion or by fall, and the patient cannot strengthen over what is lacking, and you have treated that with styptic medicines, and your treatment has not been effective, then because of this, do not insert gold wire into those that are strengthened with gold and not silver, for silver turns greenish and is loosened after a few days, but gold at no time loses its strength.
And it should be the wire in such subtlety and thickness according to the quantity that can enter between the teeth; and the form of the reception is that you take the wire and take its double between two healthy teeth, and then it grows into two twisted wires between two joined teeth, or if one or many, until it reaches the fabric to the healthy tooth of the other part. And then tighten the wire until it reaches the part from which you began, and strengthen your hand with facility and wisdom until it is not joined.
It is your strictness that strengthens the faith in the veins where the roots of the teeth do not decay.
Then remove the superfluous filaments from the veins with forceps or tweezers, and add them to any location in your gestures, and convert them into occultations between the healthy tooth and the decayed tooth, so that they do not cause injury to the tongue. Then let it be relaxed thus strongly with a Roman poultice.
Maybe if it is dislocated or bruised, strengthen it or them with another vein in such a manner that it will be whole at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the correction of two healthy teeth and of two decayed teeth, thus as they are often linked:
And when it happens that one tooth or two are returned to their proper cement in their respective locations, and they are restored thus as they had been recommended, and they remain.
And do not make that unless you are skilled artisans and wise.
And some extracted are suited to some cause of the cow's bones, and it is done in their form as a tooth form, and it is placed in the location where the tooth failed, and it is strengthened thus as we have said, and it remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
About the incision of the ligament which is in the tongue and prohibits speech.
This ligament which is below the tongue sometimes becomes relaxed or is naturally loose in which men are born, or accidentally and suddenly injured by a blow that has already been consolidated.
And the operation on it is that you open the patient's mouth, the existing tissue in the tie being; and elevate the tongue, and then incise those nervous ligaments according to the latitude within which the tongue is freed from its retention.
Maybe if there is some hardness or denseness, and that has been established by consolidation of the blow, then you inject an oil and separate it according to the latitude within which you have incised the ligament and dissolved the denseness.
And beware that there is not made a fracture in the press of the flesh and that you do not separate here the arteries and veins, and there comes a flow of blood.
And then wash the vestige of the incision with warm water or with wine or with cold water; and then pause below the tongue, licini; thus it is customary to hold the patient's tongue below in any way so that it does not consolidate another wound.
Maybe if there is a flow of blood, pause over the vitreous location, three times; maybe if the blood stops, then cauterize the location with a gentle cautery that is convenient for this. And then cure it in other causes within which it may be healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula below the tongue.
Some extracted occasions accumulate below the tongue, creating a swelling similar to a small node preventing the tongue from its natural operation; and therefore it is magnificent within which it fills the mouth.
And the operation on it is that you break open the patient's mouth, sitting in front of the light and considering the swelling.
And if you see it is of dark color or black, hard, which the patient does not feel sensation, then do not touch that place where it is cancer.
And if it has declined to whiteness, in which there is humidity, then you put the onus in it, and incise that with a subtle spatula, and incise it from the whole part; and if blood comes out at the time of your operation, then you pause above three times, thus it is vitreous, within which the blood is restrained.
And then return to your work within which you have treated it with compliment of it, within which it is washed with wine and salt; and cure it with another cure adapted to this within which it may be healed.
Chapter 36.
On the extraction of swelling from two ears and of that which is nothing in the gullet and of other swellings.
When you find in the gullet a swelling, so they are glands which are assembled thus, which accumulate beforehand and are called two ears, which when you cure them with this that we have said in the division and it is not healed, then you consider if the swelling is hard, of dark color, of little sensation, then do not touch that iron.
And if it is of red color and the root is large, then do not touch that iron for the flow of blood; unless you let it be until it is matured, and then you treat it, or it will break for itself.
And if it is of white color, radish-like, and the root of it is subtle, then that is what should be incised.
And the operation on it is that you consider, during your operation, if already the swelling has been repulsed with complete repulsion or if it is diminished with some diminution; and then do seize the patient under the sunlight, and the head of it is in the tie, and open the mouth of it, and the servant takes between their hands before the tongue below with a very noble instrument of which this is the form:
Either use silver or copper, and be subtle as a knife.
Then as you press on the tongue and show it to him, and he spits on that same vein, then take nine and place it in the amulet, and pull it towards the affected parts as much as you can. Another thing that you draw from the tunics, and then incise with an instrumental form of which this is the shape:
Another thing that you draw from the tunics, and then incise with an instrumental form of which this is the shape: and it is assembled with forceps, although the extremities of it are curved, so that the orifice of each one of them is in the interior of the other, very sharp, which is made of iron indeed.
But if this instrument is not at your present, then incise with a spatula of which this is the shape of it: It is pointed on one side, not pointed on the other side.
And after you have incised one spot, incise the other according to this same method of incision, and then apply the incision to the patient's gums with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, apply cold water of decoction of sage or mint leaves and similarly to those of the stopping causes until the flow of blood is restrained, and then cure it until it is healthy.
And some wounded places in the gullet have other apertures besides those two gold ones, and incise them according to what you have said and done in the incision of two spots equally.
And you have already medicated a woman with an apostema that was born in her gullet, the apostema which tended to turn dark, with little sensation, which had almost closed her gullet, and the woman breathed with great difficulty, and had prohibited eating and drinking water, and was about to die if it had lasted for one day or two.
And the apostema had pushed so much that it had formed two ramps inside which they had passed through two tracts.
Then you examine it thoroughly and find it in one of their eleven, and pull it out, and extract it from the large portion, and then you incise that which comprehends the other tract, and then you oblige the mouth of it, and comprehend its tongue, and then you fix it on the eleven in that apostema.
And then you remove a large part of it, and nothing flows from it except a little blood. Then the gullet of that woman was absolutely clear, and soon she began to drink water, and then you prescribed food, so you did not cease to incise from that apostema many times for a long time, and succeeded in incising the apostema in its place, which prolonged it.
Then you heal and cauterize the gullet of it, then afterwards add to it; and then you walk around and do not know that God did that miracle for me.
Chapter 38.
On the incision of a wound when it is apostematous.
When the wound is located on the skin, and it is apostematous and long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in a thick and round part, then it is called a bubo.
But when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and your cure does not conform to it, and sometimes the apostema remains subtle, then it is necessary that you incise that which is rounded and aggregated; and if it is of long duration, and is bloody, of dark color or black, and it is not at its center, then it is necessary that you fear the incision of it, because in that there is fear about the patient.
And when you sometimes do it according to the manner that you have described of its whiteness and length, that you make the patient sit and press their tongue with an instrument of which it processes its shape and then place it on the eleven in the new, and pull it down and incise it with one of two instruments which are said in the incision of two spots.
And it is necessary that you do not incise it unless it is adjusted according to the natural term of its addition, because if you incise more, you will lead the serum to speak.
And then the incision, use that which we have recommended in the incision of two spots, and cure it until it is healthy.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision of it, then use gentleness in the cauterization of it with fear, and the manner of the cautery on it is not just with sharp water, and it is that you place the head of the patient on the same seat, and then press their tongue with the instrument which we have said, and then take some water which we have spoken of in the chapter on cauterization, and conform to that living cause, and pause it neither sparse nor subtle, and of that fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the shape:
It is the extremity of the concavity in which the medicine is placed, just as the concavity of a hollow ray, and place the instrument with the medicine on the wound, and the patient will spit or form a mouthful of saliva or mucus from their mouth for the intrinsic medicine, so that it does not descend into the gullet of it and that it leads to healing.
And you should put your hand in the medicine, and express it onto the uvula for a space of a half hour within which it begins to be absorbed and seated by the bite of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a piece of cotton and wrap it around the extremity of the vein, and submerge the cotton in the medicine, and insert the vein with the cotton into a canal above until the cotton adheres to it, and do this as many times until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the vein, and then leave it there for three or four days.
And if you need to iterate the medicine, repeat it, and then perform the cauterization by burning out the circuit of the vein with cotton embedded in the border, and modify what is in the circuit of the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and cure beforehand with embrocation, and remove the bitter humors until it is sanitized.
And this type of treatment is more salvageable than incision and longer in terms of fear.
Some wounded eyes are cured with what is more subtle than cauterization and incision, because they are treated with subfumigation in this manner: take calament, ysop, origan, ruda, Arabic scicados, camomile, broyda and similar to those of the herbs, and adjust all those causes, or some of them, into a mixture, and let them steep in warm vinegar, and boil; and let the mixture be washed decently, and be placed in the middle of the mixture, on top of which is placed an instrument made of silver or copper according to this manner; it should be made of silver or copper.
And insert the extremity into the patient's mouth until the vapor reaches the uvula above the vein, until the uvula is most decongested.
And then iterate over those many wounded areas until it is dry, and beware that you do not perform this treatment at the onset of abscesses, because they would too quickly adjust to the abscess, and do not believe that you are doing it, but rather declare the abscess of the cautery.
But if you do not have this instrument present, then take a cane and compose it into the extremity of one closed in a hood, so that the patient's mouth is comforted, because the closed hood prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
On the extraction of thorns and of what adheres to the gums and other causes.
Many wounded areas adhere to the gums or thorn of feet or some other cause.
Then you will know that you extract what is apparent, on which the sight falls, because you take the tongue with an instrument only under the sun, so that it is declared to you what is in the gums.
And what does not appear and is hidden in the gums, you will make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, because strongly the annexed cause of the gums will be evacuated by vomiting; or that the patient's throat is cleared with a piece of nap or radish of lettuce or a dry crust of bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge, and bind it strongly with faith, and then pass the patient through this, so that when you reach the place where the thorns are extracted, then it will be fully evacuated. And perhaps take an eel and bind it with faith, and place it on the table and subsequently extract it; or take a porcupine and subsequently extract its quills and subsequently extract the intestine.
But if you do not fully evacuate with those causes which we have mentioned, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
And it is more gross than a small vein, and in the extremity of the vein is conquered what you insert into its gums with ease.
And the old man's head is elevated on them, and beware that the touch of his bones in the throat, so that he does not suffocate himself, and it pierces the bone or the thorn, or that he bites his hand.
Perhaps the patient who inserts himself is worse, because of his knowledge of the place of the annexed cause and it pierces him, and he pulls his hand with the instrument on them, all according to the quantity which is prepared until it is fully evacuated.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of bad blood annexed to the gums.
When bad blood is treated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and not comforts, consider then the gums of the patient's mouth to the sun, because you have comprehended the tongue of him with an instrument which you have recommended.
Then if you see the bad blood, extract it with a small hook or with subtle gestures decently.
And if it is not possible to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's gums, and place a pause in the concavity of the cannula with an ignited iron, and do this as many times (until the bad blood is dead and separated from the gums) and abstain from giving the patient water for a whole day.
And then take a full glass of cold water, and put the patient's mouth to it, and wash their mouth with it; and do not give them any cause for nausea or vomiting, but rather keep the water in their mouth for an hour, because the blood circulation is felt almost instantly when the water touches.
Perhaps it is not forgotten in the water that we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cimetic or asafoetida through the instrument that we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Make a draft, it will be ready in four days.
And it is another manner of operation in the fumigation of that, which is to take a nutmeg and the nutmeg is covered with a cloth in the middle of which there is a tube; and then give underneath the fumigation; and place the patient's mouth at the end of the cane, and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not forgotten until you know that the fumigation has reached the blood circulation, because the blood circulation comes almost instantly.
And if it does not help, then you will repeat the fumigation many times, and keep the patient from drinking, and give causes of salty foods and soups, and do not give water, and thus it is necessary that this regimen be forgotten.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which the blood circulation of the gouty patient is treated; and it resembles forceps, also as times, but only because it has a certain curvature. Which is applied to the gouty patient, and its end resembles a beak of a stork, which is guarded, in which there is an attachment of lime, so that, when it takes hold of some cause, that does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the sum of the sermon in perception of abscesses and in section of theirs.
The abscesses are many special kinds, of many manners, according to the remembrance of them, as is written in this book.
And they are diverse in perforation and section of them for two manners, of which one is for the species of abscesses in their measures; and for that which comprehends the humidities.
And the second manner is for the places in which accidents of the body happen, because an abscess on the head is different from an abscess on the buttock; and an abscess in a fleshy place happens differently from an abscess in a joint; and each of them is judged according to operation.
And many abscesses are such that they require not only perforation but also maturation of the wound in those or completion of them.
Some abscesses are such that they require being drained when they are crossed, and do not mature according to their completion, like abscesses that are close to the joints, because an abscess when it reaches a joint, its essence is prolonged until it can corrode the ligaments or nerves of that joint, so that it becomes a cause of contraction of that member; or it is an abscess close to a principal member, and if you delay the perforation of it until it is matured, you will harm the principal member; or it is close to the buttock, therefore perforate without maturation, and do not require a crossed perforation, lest it corrode the surrounding area of the buttock, and become a fistula, or be made in the term of it that it may not be healthy. You need to know the time for perforating the abscess, and thus it is when it is mature.
And you know that it is mature when there is a decrease of pain and cessation of fever, and also a decrease of rigor and pulse, and the acute state of the head of the abscess, and other signs.
And because you need to know that the perforation should be made in the place where the pus is below the abscess and where the pus comes out during the cure of the swelling.
And perforation is sometimes for the length of the flesh or of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the places of the tendons, of the cords of the nerves, of the arteries; and, afterwards, in all hidden places where there is no reflection; because in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to delay the perforation of it until the digestion of it is confirmed according to its completion, as we have said; because if you perforate that beforehand, it prolongs the body of the pus and of much foulness, and strengthens the lips of it so they are hardened and the depth of it.
Many abscesses are perforated according to the latitude of the flesh or body which needs it, or according to what the affected member indicates.
And you know that you should administer small perforation, and in large abscesses a large perforation and ample or many sections according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And other times the apostemes are in those places where the codena is enclosed and surrounded, when it is made thus that it pains everywhere and it is made in terms of what has already been established, thus as one who accumulates in tropics of doule and of bubbles.
And of those that are thus inserted have three angles; and of those that are inserted thus as a figure of the leaf of myrtle, thus as the apostemes of the groin.
And of theirs that are administered round section and lunar section, and they seem to be like those.
Maybe that which is not capable thus as are superficial apostemes of lions, because you perforate that with a superficial perforation, or you plane only so much.
And it happens when the aposteme is large and has already collected much sania, that you perforate it and do not touch that you extract all the pus at that hour; having extracted a part of it, and then you open the aposteme another day, and then you extract a larger part, and then you make those motas gradually evacuated according to graduation until it is fully purged.
And especially if the patient is of a green complexion, or pregnant woman, or small child, or old and decrepit, because the animal spirit is resolved to expel the sania with great effort, and it kills the patient, and you operate on them.
And beware of this chapter with great caution, and then make your perforation in which you perforate these apostemes, because you will cleanse the plague and consider thus if the plague of the aposteme is small, or it is a flat section, then you administer the remedies of oil or of antidote; and if the aposteme is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then beware that you pause in some traction until they converge together.
And if in the aposteme a part of the codena is cut off or has concaved in the circuit, then beware that you complete it with a cloth very much or with a thread of fil de drap, thus as when you have treated pans or razizos, they humidify; and strengthen it until the third day; and then proceed and cure what is necessary to heal the wound.
Maybe you encounter a flow of blood during the time of your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar in those places where you apply a cloth of oil, and pause that over the area of the flowing blood, gradually evacuated.
Maybe you preserve the flow of blood, then beware that you administer regimen and cure, and powder those which have been recommended in many places of our book and division.
Maybe it is in winter time, and the place of the aposteme is a place of many nerves, then beware that you apply powders in wine and oil, and pause those over the places.
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy, then beware that you pause powders mixed with water and oil or wine and oil, and all that is cold until the third day, thus as we have said, and then beware that you dissolve the aposteme and cleanse it and administer the cure of what is convenient to heal.
And thus it is necessary to know the cure of apostemes universally, maybe according to the way of distinction already said about each aposteme in which manner it is the way of curing them by chapters singularly.
Chapter 41.
On the sections of apostemes which come into the codena of the head.
In the codena of the small head, little apostemes, and thus of species of nodes which contain tunics that are there in fact; and the species of theirs are many.
And of them they are pungent, and of those that contain humidity similar to lime. And of those that contain humidity similar to pores, and they resemble theirs; and of those that are lapideous, hard.
And in the section of everything, and in the extraction of those that do not fear, because it is necessary to extract those that do not make counter-arcadia.
And the operation in section of those is that you sprinkle those with an instrument in the form of which you have seen beforehand, which is called entromes, until you know what they contain.
Because if it contains humidity, then you separate that in sections according to the longitude by section superficially according to this form:
And it begins in the section of the line .B. until the line .G. Therefore, when the humidity is evacuated, then you excavate that because it contains that humidity, and do not leave any cause of everything, because many evacuated things return, if it remains from some cause.
And then you submerge it in Egyptian inguent, if it is present, and if not, in water and salt; and you fill that with the plague and let it until another day, because all that corrodes everything that remains of that skin.
And then you iterate over that cloth with Egyptian inguent secondly and thirdly if it is indicated by it, until you are confident that there remains no cause of that skin; then cure the plague with inguent until it is healed.
And if you find a fatty swelling, then you insert it according to this method: You make an incision in the shape of a cross, and cut between the two lips of the incision and remove all the infected part, and extract your virtue in removing the tunic that contains it.
Maybe you will find an opposing hardness, then make something that you can counteract it primarily.
And similarly, you make a lapificated incision of the section and cure according to what you have said; and the incision over the lapificated apostema is less painful, because it is of little bleeding and little humidity.
And some veins are like channels of these apostemas which are in the head of some men where there is no humidity; this causes because you have injected into an apostema on the head of an old woman and you have touched the apostema thus as a rough, asperous, whitish thing, which could not be touched, and if someone had touched it, they would have been plagued by that.
Maybe in the other accidental apostemas on the head another thing is not this capital, thus as the apostemas that come to the heads of children and devour the roots of the ears, maybe the incision of all these should be superficial.
And stop the perforation of those from the lower part, because it is more comfortable for the body of the patient to have the lowest parts freed.
And then heal those in water that are suitable for that kind of cure.
Chapter 42.
On the incision of scrofula which occur on the neck.
Some swollen veins come to these apostemas on the neck and in the axillas and in the armpits; and some swollen veins occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur on the neck, and many that are engendered between them, and all scrofula of those has its own proper tunic, and thus as in the nodes and apostema of the head, thus as we have recommended.
And the species of these scrofula are many, because some of them are lapideous, and some contain humidity, and some are malignant which do not obey cure.
Therefore, in that one which you find of good disposition in the Tocament, whose color is manifestly similar to the color of the codena, and it is spread to all parts, and it is not attached to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the hardness, and it is not swollen, so that you incise superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line .G. into the line .B., and scrape away all parts, and extend two lips of the codena at once, or many at once if there is need of those, thus as we have said in the apostemas of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is more cautious not to incise the vein or nerve.
And it is a bad spatium that does not adjust to your hand in incision, or that it bothers the patient, and that it incises what is not necessary to incise; because if you incise a vein or hardness and prohibit yourself from your operation, then stop at the vetriol plague treated with other powders that stop the flow of blood, and strengthen the plague, and lay it inside until the acuteness of the apostema is repulsed and the plague is mollified and begins to be purulent. When the blood has been drained away.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then investigate if it is said that some cause of the other small scrofula has been removed, so incise those and clean those.
And if it is in the root of the large scrofula vein, because then you should not incise that scrofula from its root. Before, because it seems that those are double-layered and very strong, and you should leave them until they fall out by themselves without any harm.
And then fill the wound with old cloth which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then heal that.
And if you incise the entire scrofula, then because you adjust the two lips of the wound and cauterize as soon as possible so that no supernumerary flesh remains.
Maybe you think that supernumerary flesh has remained because of the greatness of the scrofula, because you should intend to incise the root of that, and estrange it and administer suture and what has been said.
And that of the scrofula which contains humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation here where you find the place of maturation of it, and stop the perforation of what is the lowest part of the body, thus as we have said.
And then administer perforation, with calques in ointment and similarly to those, so that it corrodes what has been corrupted by the corruption. And when you have often cleansed the wound thoroughly, then you should heal that generated flesh inwardly so it becomes healthy.
Chapter 43.
About the section of the pill of the accidental abscess that occurs in the groin area.
They disapproved of these ancient practices in this section, and did not see any man in our land who had made that artificial medicine.
And this is the inscription on the sermon of those ones.
More often in men there is a lack of skill, because the extraction of the pill is avoided, since it cannot be done gently, lest all the veins and major parts of the body are damaged here.
More often in those who have abscesses that burst in the mouth or groin area or two kidneys, when the badness is not in the blood, because they use the section of pill to avoid the loss which is done by perforation.
Therefore, when we want to cut it out, we should incise the pill under three circles of the circles of the pill, or four small sections for the width in that which is between two circles by quantity, so that the section is in cipher, not in the cartilage, and this place is convenient for section, because it is deprived of flesh and the veins of blood that are there.
And if the doctor is inexperienced, then he should extend the cord of the groin area to the ninth, and then insert the cord inward so it reaches the canal, more avoid the blood vessels if you see them for some reason.
And then cut the membranes according to what we have recommended; and it is significant about the section of the canal for the weakness which is from that exit, that is from the disorder and for the abortion of the vote.
And then the wound was open for some time.
Therefore, when the hour is renewed in which the perforation is tempered, add two lips of the cord of the wound, and thus only the cartilage remains.
And then administer medicines that make the flesh grow inwardly so it becomes healthy.
And thus says Albucasis that the summary of the sermon which we have recommended, is not but that you see that some of these abscesses have already operated on the groin area of the body, and the body has come to death, and the wing of it is between the legs, and some went to incise the epiglottis so that the body breathes over the place of the wound for some respiration, and it is saved from death.
And therefore I command to leave the open wound until the evil of the badness is consumed; and it is the evil of it for three days; and then I command thus the wound, and heal it until it becomes healthy.
And what I have seen through my experiments, is that a servant held a knife and placed it in the left groin area and incised one part of the vein of the lung, and I was called to cure him, and I approached him thus as he was dying, and discovered the wound and approached the blood which was coming out of the small wound.
Therefore I was forced to confess that he had not incised a vein nor guided it, and the wind came out of the wound, and I healed it until it became healthy.
And I did not accuse the servant if he did not return to his duties, and then some days returned to the administration of his own dispositions.
And now I say that in the section of the pill there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
About the section on abscesses that occur in the groin area before, and it is called hernia of the groin.
This abscess named hernia of the groin is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and it is more common in women.
And it is according to two manners, because either it is natural or accidental.
And in the natural one, it is not necessary to heal.
And the accidental one is according to two manners of which one is similar to fatty nodes, and the other manner is similar to an abscess that is made by nodulation of an artery, and in that there is fear. And it does not happen that it makes a presumption about him unless he is small. And you probe that and investigate that which I have told you, and if you find it similar to fatty nodes, and it is not suspended in any of the veins, then you incise it thus as the nodes, and extract it from the water that contains the flesh and pus; and otherwise, then it is thoroughly scrutinized throughout the entire being, and then I cure the place where it needs healing until it becomes healthy.
Chapter 45.
About the section on the species of nodes.
There are many species of nodes and I have already said all the species of them in the division.
And it is necessary that I recommend thus the difference between node and exostosis, because it makes doubt.
Then it is said that there is an excess of heat and fever and violent pains inside, which settles the turbulence of the superfluity; and it is a completed putrefaction that stops the fever, pain, and heat.
Perhaps there is no heat nor fever nor pain, and it is a hidden cyst that is next to the sac proper.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a wound and it is made thus as a void, whether major or minor, and they are according to two species, because they are fat or contain humidity, and the colors of humidity are many, according to what you say in the division.
Then we see, when arriving at the cure of nothing, that you expound on that and inquire into the beginning of the instrument which is called introments, according to what you will find its form in the chapter which is properly assigned to this.
And it is the method of inquiry into abscesses and all nodes, and it is that you take this instrument and introduce it into the place where you found humidity in the abscess, and you will revolve the threads little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the cavity.
And finally, place your hand according to the measure of the greatness of the abscess, and finally extract the introments and consider what is written in the residue of it.
And if the current humidity is forgotten, of whatever color it may be, then you insert it with a superficial section according to what has been said about the other abscesses.
And if there is no humidity in the residue of the introments, then you know that it is fat.
And cut above it with a section having the form of a cross according to this form: Thus as you instruct, and suspend that which is once cut, and clear the cavity of all parts to facilitate, and keep the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract that sanity from the node.
Perhaps if it is broken in the operation, it is not possible to extract that sanity, and many things are lost, and then you extract it by pieces until nothing remains from it for any cause.
Because if there is nothing remaining from it for any cause, little or too much, the node returns according to its nature.
And if you see that some small part remains, then complete the plague of some corrosive sharp powders, and strengthen the plague, and pause over that which sits on the cautious abscess, and cure it with another cure until it is healthy.
And if it is a large node, then you kiss the two lips of it and cure it with that which incarnates.
Perhaps if the pulse comes to the contrary, or non-pulse, then you touch and fill the place of three trissat that is vitriol and leave it straight for two days or three until the plague is poured out and the turbulence of the blood is restored; and finally return to inspect what remains of the node.
Chapter 46.
On the forms of instruments necessary for section and perforation.
On those that are the forms of the introments, and they are of three species, which of those is large, and of those is medium, and of those is small.
The form of the large introment is this:
The form of the small introment is this:
Thus made of iron, of alum, of extracted and well-prepared extremities, so that they fasten the instrument in the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the experiences, and they are named "albered", and one of those is called "berid".
And they are of three species, because of those is large, medium, and small.
The form of the large experience, form of it:
The form of the medium experience, form of it:
The form of the small experience, form of it:
It is convenient that they are for those abscesses and exits and fistulas and swellings, so that among them there are those of the bones and other causes.
And they are thus rounded, large, leons, thus with large agulhas in which there are sewn the seams, and they are made of pure citrine, or of pure iron, or of silver, And the better ones are when they are made of pure citrine.
And they are thus the experiences of black plum, which ones agree that for those there are opened the fistulas in the cavity of which ones are reflected, that are reflected with their lightness in those reflections.
And they are of three species, because some of those are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the quantity of the amble of the fistula and the structure of it.
Form of the large experience of plum:
Form of the medium experience of plum:
Form of the small experience of plum:
The forms of the ulcers are from various special motives, because those that are simple, like a solitary curvature, and they are of three species: large, small, and medium.
And their open ulcers are of three species.
And those ulcers that have two curvatures, and they are of three species.
And theirs have three curvatures, and they are of three species.
And all these things are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple ulcer, form of it:
Form of a large ulcer having two curvatures: Form of a medium-sized ulcer having two curvatures: Form of a small ulcer having two curvatures:
Form of a large ulcer having three curvatures:
Form of a medium-sized ulcer having three curvatures:
And these are the forms of the scalpels that are used to cut and scrape the nodes and abscesses, and they are of three species, because those are large, medium-sized, and small.
Form of a large scalpel:
Form of a medium-sized scalpel:
Form of a small scalpel:
The extremities of those that are made for sharp section and the other extremities not for dull sections, and they are not paused in such a manner, but rather to be made smoothly in the excavation of the nodes, fearing the incidence of vein or nerve injury, and so that the patient may be healed and tranquility may be attained by adjusting little by little to avoid the excoriation of the abscess.
And these are the forms of emollients, and they are of three species: large, medium-sized, and small, just like you see.
There are four kinds of errant humors and they resemble the roots that are in the humor and are made into a poultice.
And it is in the pointed extremity of the hidden abscess and in that correct place you will find the divided and defined parts, when you want, just as you see.
The forms of spatulas, which are used to search between the fingers for the perforation of the abscesses and do not perceive the patients, and they are of three species: large, medium-sized, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of ventoses that absorb the flow of blood, and they are of three species; large, medium-sized, and small; the forms of it:
There are four kinds of citrine humors, round and with some length, and they are subtle.
And it is necessary that these species of ventoses are large, medium-sized, and small, so that they absorb the flow of blood with velocity in necessity, and then when you first apply them, it is not medicine.
However, they are not used to absorb blood in every part of the body, and they are only used in fleshy areas, such as on the thighs and legs, and on the arms, and on the breasts, and abdomen, and genitals, and similarly to their use on fleshy areas.
And some evacuated areas are made of those other small instruments similar to scisors according to this form; for which the blood is absorbed when it is made through phlebotomy, or there is incidence of vein or artery.
And some evacuated areas are made round according to this form:
Chapter 47.
On the treatment of the breasts of men which are similar to those of women.
Some evacuated areas are swollen breasts of some men who have the complement of sleeping with women, and they are swollen breasts, and similar to the breasts of women, and Roman abscesses, ulcers.
And to he who has that, it is necessary to make incisions in those areas with lunar section according to this form, from line B to line G, and then excoriates the entire grossness, and then fills the plague of incarnated medicine, and then adjusts the two labial lips of the plague with cosideration, and cures he who is within so that he may be healed.
But if the breast declines to the lower parts and is mollified by its greatness just like in women, then it is divided into two lateral sections under the nipples, with two lunar-like sections, each of which contains one in the other so that the major line contains the minor according to this form from line B to line G. And then excoriates the codena which is between the two labial lips of the plague, and removes the pungency, and administers what we have said about the suture and powders that are necessary in the cure so that it may be healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of that which covers the inflamed area of the patient, and for flow of blood, then it is necessary to fill the wound with submergent corrosive powder and apply that corroding agent which is Roman grey powder, and then heal that wound so it may be healthy.
Chapter 48.
About the piercing of abscesses that come from beneath the nipple.
These abscesses that come from beneath the nipple are of the type of scrofula, hard, which contain a fluid that is sacred.
And of those so some that contain humidity; and those that contain humidity it is necessary to incise them with a lunar section according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all that is in the abscess of the vein has been evacuated, then you complete the wound with a lot of cotton and leave the entrance open for another day.
And then the wound should be dressed and treated in a conveniently absorbent way, until it is healthy.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes, and of scrofula, then you should make an incision above it as we have said in the section on scrofulous swellings.
If the wound is extended in such a way that it becomes putrid, then administer to it the cautery as we have previously mentioned.
Chapter 49.
About the incision of abscesses that occur through arteries or veins.
When an artery is broken, and the codena (a type of vessel?) is consolidated which is above it, then many times an abscess occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are through the artery or vein: because when the abscess is through an artery, it is often felt in the pulse of the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel a stridor (a whistling or rustling sound) in the veins.
And that which is through a vein is recognized by the obvious signs of the body.
And the incision above this abscess is erroneous, and it is especially worse in those that are beneath the ribs, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very great, therefore it is necessary to avoid its cure with iron, and that which is in the extremities, or at the head, it is necessary to evade.
It is better about that which is due to inflammation of the orifice of the artery, to make an incision in the codena (vessel) at length; and then to open the incision with a hook, and to expose the artery, and to remove the tunics until it is discovered.
And then place the needle above that vessel and make it penetrate into the other side, and constrict the artery with a double thread in two places, — which causes you to have dominance in extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
And then puncture the place that is between two ligaments with a spatulum until all the blood that is in it is drained out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer a cure in which is generated pus until the ligaments are clean; and then treat it conveniently with absorbent materials until it is healthy.
And if it is an abscess by incision of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible of the abscess in the codena (vessel), and then introduce the needle beneath the place where you have held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and be in that double filament until you extract it from the other side, and then ligate the abscess with a good ligament according to what has been said to you about the ligament of the uva4 (a type of vessel?) of two parts at the extremities of the thread.
It is better if you extract the thread, then introduce the thread into that needle beneath all the abscess from the incision of the first needle, and constrict the four threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in the middle place of it until when you have sat what is in it, then you incise the superfluity of the vessel, and leave what is left of it tied.
And then pause over the pus which has submerged in wine and oil, and then administer the cure which is made with warm baths and convenient absorbent materials until it is healthy.
Chapter 51: About the abscess that occurs through torsion of nerves.
Thus abscesses occur in arteries and veins, and similarly abscesses occur in nerves when they occur through their percussion or through excessive superfluity, and through similarity.
And it is done in the best way in the places of the joints or of the ankle, or in all places where the joints are weakened.
And it is a severe abscess, and it is similar in color to the other body, and it is among the major dispositions of its own will, and when it is stricken with vehementia, it seems like the patient has a stupor.
And it is not an abscess added to the chest of the body, and therefore the coding is discharged, and it is already entirely divided and does not go to the fore or rear parts.
Therefore, of those that are in the joints, it does not seem that they were invaded by iron, because their strong contraction is contrary.
Maybe that which is on the head or on the forehead feels the coding in a spasm. Maybe if it is a small abscess, then you have those with forced evacuations and absorb that which is rooted.
And if it is large, then you suspend it in a hook, and excavate that, and then remove it; and adjust the wound with a suture, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter fifty-one.
On the section of abscesses that occur on the skin that occur on the belly.
It is found in some homes that there are many moist places in the bellies of those and in other parts of the body of those that are called fungal because of their similarity to fungi, from which the root is subtle and at the head of that is large; and already the lips of those are converted, and it is of those that is small, and it is of those that is very magnificent.
And I have already seen one, and in the belly of that there were two of those that were more similar to fungi, and there was no difference between those white things, with a small root.
And already the lips of those were turned inward and were split, and humidity flowed from that at all times.
Therefore I inserted them and extracted it in one weight of eighteen ounces. and the other weighs six ounces.
And the operation on the insertion of their is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the tissue is white, humid, with a subtle root; then you insert them with a spatula flat, and you are in your presence burning with cauterizing fire, because many moist places need to expel much blood; and if you see the blood, cauterize that.
And if the patient is pale and trembles, beware of inserting iron; maybe then take a small piece of recently made lead, and strengthen it on that tissue, in the manner which is what we have said; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust on the structure of the lead wire; therefore, do not cease strengthening the large lead grain in the tissue, until it is absorbed and falls through its own efforts.
Maybe if the tissue is of large root, then in the insertion of it there is some cause of fear and of pain, and especially in that which is in the belly.
Maybe it is possible that you insert the marrow of it, and then cauterize that so it does not return.
And then cure it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to insert the tissue that is of dark color, of little sensation, of light regard, because that is almost cancerous.
And I will find a remedy for cancer in this way also.
Chapter fifty-two.
On the cure of inflammation of the navel.
Inflammation of the navel is caused by many causes; or from fissures of the ciphac which is above the belly, and they draw out the web or intestine according to where it ends in other ruptures; or from blood that flows from a vein or artery as has been said before, or from constricted wind in it.
Maybe if it is from a fissure of the ciphac and by settlement of the web, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and it has a lion's pain, and then appears in diverse situations. And if it is from an egression of the intestine, then the situation of that is in water that we have recounted, with maybe very vehement diversity, and as you press that in the ties it is hidden, and then returns; and strongly it is in water so, and it is magnificent with much entrance of bath and vehement effort.
Maybe if it is from humidity, then it is a lion and is not hidden when you press with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it created.
And if it is from blood, then there are those signs that appear with the abscess in black and declining.
Maybe if it is from bad flesh, then it is a severe abscess, large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity.
Maybe if it is from wind, then the touch of it is a lion.
And the operation on it is that you consider then if the inflammation of the navel is from blood of artery, or of vein, or from wind; then it is necessary to prohibit the cure of it, because in that there is fear and pain also as I have written in the chapter where I said about abscesses from artery and vein.
And if the inflammation of the navel is from the intestine or from the web, then it is necessary to command the patient to hold their belly still, and be standing extended; and then place a tent in the circuit of the whole navel, and then command it to stay turned between the two hands above the belly, and then circulate with a spatula flat in the circuit of the navel around the area where you have felt the tension; and then extend the marrow of the abscess to the parts below in an ounce grain; and then place it in the circuit with strong faith or with a decent manner.
And if you have extended the membrane of the apostema over the ligament and inserted the thin tie into that index finger and it reaches the intestine; and if you have not encountered or guarded by the ligament, then extract the hardened parts and push the intestine back into its proper place in the belly.
And if you have encountered the membrane, then take hold of it with an unción; and remove the excess fluids from it.
Perhaps it is opposed to your artery or vein, then circle around that motion, and return to your operation; and take two needles and place them in those two strong veins and insert the two needles into the circuit which has formed around the apostema in a manner of crossing, which allows them to penetrate; and then strengthen the apostema in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area between where the extended flesh can be seen and fall for itself; or remove that which is subtle and falls away, and then cure that wound which covers the ulcers within so that it may be healthy.
And if the prominence of the navel is of flesh or due to humidity, then cover so that you conquer the apostema as we have said and remove the blood or humidity, which it attracts in itself, and then cure that wound which covers and consolidates the area.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have spoken, in the division, of a type of cancer and in what manner it is necessary to go about the treatment of it with medicines, and that it is essential to avoid ulceration during the treatment so that it does not spread; and we have said that cancer is engendered in the marrow and caution is required for its treatment.
And the doctors say that some vegetated cancers are in a place where it is possible to eradicate them, just as with cancer of the kind which is in the breasts or in the thigh and has a resemblance to the limbs allocated to extract all of that, and especially when it starts small.
Perhaps when it is old and large, it does not cover that which belongs to it, because you cannot be healthy from that ulcer nor have I seen another, nor has it been possible to reach that.
And the operation on it is as we have said, that you should purge and evacuate the patient of black bile, and then cut away the malignant growth, if it has been encountered with a manifest relapse.
And then prepare the patient with preparation in which the location of the operation is, and prohibit in the tract any uncleanness that covers it; and then concave all parts of the code so that a good perexcrutacio occurs without leaving any cause of the roots of it. And let the blood flow, and do not absorb that leakage, and express the locations, and abstain from the thick blood all at once with your hand or instrument which is possible among the instruments.
Perhaps if you have made opposition to the thick blood in the incision of a vein or artery, then cauterize that within so that the flow of blood ceases, and then cure it with another cure so that it may be healthy.
Chapter 54.
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recommended, in the division, the species of dropsy from water, and the signs of each species, for the treatment of it with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is not except for the species of altitudes alone, and it does not approach with iron to the species of tympanitis nor to the species of hypsocha, because that is mortal.
And when you have medicated this species of dropsy tympanitis with medicines and do not combine your medication, then consider, because if the patient has already been debilitated, or it is another disease, another dropsy, just as it is in the tonsils or belly and similar to those, then beware that you do not medicate with iron, because fear is about that.
Perhaps if you have seen the patient with an exuberant vertigo, and it is not another disease but only dropsy, and neither infant nor old, then the manner of the operation on it is that you elevate the patient between your hands, and minister to him to expel the belly of it with his own hand, by pouring water at the part below the navel, and then take spiny spatium according to this form:
It should be of two sharp points, long and pointed at the extremity, like a spatium; perhaps meanwhile it is in something brief, little by little, so that during the operation it does not pass into the intestine, and that leads to that.
And then consider if the generation of dropsy is from parts of the intestines, because then it covers that you should section yourself alone at the navel for a quantity of three fingers below, in the right direction above the navel.
Perhaps if the generation of dropsy is due to illness of the liver, then your section should be on the left side of the navel for three fingers.
If the generation of it is through the mixing, then your section should be in the right direction.
And do not cover that your section should be over the ribs, on which you want to move the patient so that the excessive fluids do not accumulate at that spot frequently.
Then perforate with the instrument the entire code, and then insert into that section, and elevate your hand between the code and the siphac, and you will excavate it; and if it's the quantity of an ounce or around.
Then perforate the siphac until you reach the spot where you want to evacuate, and it is there that the water is. Then extract it and insert an instrument of which this is the shape: and it is similar to a subtle silver cannula; it is made of silver or copper or gold, at the lower end of which there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its extremity is shaped like a feather, thus sometimes:
And at the upper extremity of it there is a handle, because when the instrument reaches the water, then it draws upon the instrument, thus evacuating the water in the desired quantity, because if you evacuate more than that, it will not cover it in an hour, and the patient will die from resolution of their animal spirit, or it will approach the fifth crisis, which is approaching death.
You evacuate it according to the quantity of its virtue and according to what is signified to you by the dispositions of the patient's virtue, of the pulse of it and of its goodness.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water which causes it because it is retained so much by the code that retains the hole which is over the siphac, of which I recommend to you that you perforate it according to that manner.
Then try the instrument another day if the patient tolerates it sometimes, and extract a small quantity of water, and do it for several days on tempered fear, and beware of error lest you don't remove enough water.
But if you fear for the patient, and let go of a great quantity of water, then cure it with embalming in hot sand, and bury it in a bath, and expose it to the sun for a long time; and cure it with desiccative medicines until it is healthy.
And cauterize over the stomach, and the mixing and the feet, as you have recounted in what has been said before.
Chapter 5.
On the cure of children whose urinary passages are not perforated.
Some born children are thus from the womb of their mother and the head of their mixture is not perforated (or has a narrow passage or is not in its place).
Then it is necessary to open the perforation of it as soon as it is born, with a very subtle instrument according to this form:
And then stop in the hole a small key of lead and tie it, and you will pass three days or four.
And when he wants to urinate, it is retained and held back; and then return it.
And if you do not stop the lead, it is possible that the urine which goes over the spot will not release this closure.
But that one whose hole is narrow should be medicated with a lead key, as we have said, for many days until it is amplified.
But those in whom the hole is not in its place, are led astray, which causes it because of those, that one who is born with a hole is devoid of the end of the verge for he cannot urinate at the divided parts, until he elevates the verge with his hand to the upper parts; and it is not according to generation, so that the sperm cannot reach the mother, and it is a very bad malady.
And the manner of operation on it is that the patient is placed on their back, and then extend the head of the verge with your left hand in a vehement extraction, and insert the head of the verge at the spot of the perpucii in a very subtle place, thus like an insertion of feathers, or that you do not touch any part, so that the middle of the verge seems similar to the head of the verge and that the hole falls into its proper place according to what is necessary.
And beware that in your operation of flux of blood, because many times it happens thus; and stop yourself at the moment when it absorbs the blood, and cure the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 6.
On the whiteness that happens in the perpucii at the head of the verge and of corruption and blackness and adherence of the perpucii to the head of the verge.
Many born children happen to have this whiteness in the verge and it is a sign of bad flesh.
And of those, one is malignant and another is non-malignant.
It is not malignant, because you should suspend the thin and subtle parts in that area until it penetrates the entire world; and then pause over the subtle joint, making an Egyptian poultice; and then apply it, so that the thin part is sanctified during the day.
And if it is malignant, by white colour, then you should administer cautery at the incision site and according to its ratio.
Perhaps if it is in the foreskin of the penis uncircumcised, and one part of it is behind the foreskin and another part is in front, then you should remove the part that is behind to consolidate it; and then you cure what is in front, because when you cure what is behind, it is not assured that it will not be troublesome.
And also it happens similarly in the genitals and in the black and corrupted foreskin, therefore you should conquer all that which is already denigrated and which wants to corrupt or has become corrupted; and then place liniments on that with good milk, which is contaminated with powder of scorpions and of bitter roots and crivellations.
And then heal it with another healing treatment until it is healthy.
Perhaps if there is a flow of blood, then administer lunar cautery according to this form:
because youthful cautery is in two dispositions at the same time, thus there is a flow of blood and a plague when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and is totally destroyed at that hour, then you should introduce into the middle of the foreskin a tube of lead so that the patient urinates through it.
In the adherence of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adherence does not occur except in that one whose foreskin is sound, and over it no circumcision has been performed; and when adherence occurs due to plague or aposteme) then you should scrape with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is completely liberated.
And if it is difficult to detach those exquisite things, then you should scrape with a spatula for some reason of the head of the penis and of the foreskin, and thus it is because the foreskin, when it is subtle, is easily perforated by its subtlety.
And then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a subtle drain, which has already been softened in cold water so that they do not adhere again another time.
And then it is cured with a six-day treatment until it is consolidated.
Chapter 47.
On the purification of children and the cure of what occurs in those who are circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity thus with the other plagues: perhaps it will be better if it is from our operation and our will, and those of that are properly in the children, it is necessary to assign them to a better operation and way, lest they lose their health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not practice circumcision in any of their free laws, because they did not use it in their writings, and it is only because they acquired it through experience, which causes them to have discovered the majority of the artisans and barbers using circumcision and purification with a new and terrible torment; and they used ligament with faith and incision with a fingernail.
And I have already prohibited all these ways and did not discover better purification with forceps, with ligament with faith, which in purification is with the fingernail, because many times the code is fled from below, because the code of the foreskin has two tunics, and one tunic is below, and therefore it is forced to another incision and secure pain. And in the purification which is done by alphabecation, and it is digital, of which the sabatiers make use, the incision of the extremity of the virile member is not secured, because therefore it enters into its canal.
Perhaps in the operation with the fingernail, therefore you obstruct iron and corrupt your operation. And the code of the child is brief by nature, and many times it is veiled in such a way that there is no need for purification, and I have seen that.
Perhaps of the purification that is done with forceps and ligaments with faith, the goodness, experiment has discovered for me, because the forceps are of proportional incision, for what the acuity that is below is thus with the acuity that is above; and therefore as you take your hand so proportionally, and incise accordingly in one time; and it is done with compression of the faith in a figure containing the code of the penis of all parts, in which there is no error at all.
And the manner of the primary operation is that you make the child stay still if it is one of those who understand a little, so that you do not do anything except hold the faith in its penis only thus, and that you leave it until another day.
And then you will make that joyful spirit whole in all that manner which is at your disposal to receive its intelligence. And then you will have that standing between your hands positioned preparedly, and it should not be seen; hide the forceps in your hand or let them fall to the ground, so that the child does not see them nor any of the other instruments.
And then you will insert your hand into the patient's groin and blow into the colon, and pull out what is ejected from the head of the groin, and then you will proclaim that which is added to it as a result of the disorder.
The shape of the forceps is for proclamation, this is the shape:
Some of them are extramitated not-twisting and the others are twisting, so that it is not seen the branch of the nail, and it is the length of the two fingers thus as the length of two wrist-joints.
The mistake in proclamation is because you forcibly evacuate the entire internal colon, or part of it that comes out with the incision.
So you should extend that from your time at your fingernail before the postulation of the place and incise it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then extract it with a hook and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and you see that it is inflamed below the postulated groin, then let it be until the postulated abscess has ripened, and excavate that which is facilitated, and incise it according to your preparation.
And beware of the head of the groin, lest you hurt what is there.
And so cure it with that which the plague consolidates from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised from the colon above measure, and you have opened the parts above, that which is not known to him.
And but cure it with that which we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the cure of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction caused by stone or by congealed blood, or by hernia or by flesh, and it seems similar to those things that we have said about the methods of cure in the division.
And if it is not dissolved in that which we have said is the vehement cause of the patient, then it is necessary to administer an extraction of it with an instrument called a syringe, of which this is the shape: It should be of silver and very subtle, like a canal of pea-sized hole subtlety in a ray long and similar to a palm and a half, at which there is a subtle canal in its head.
And the method of evacuation of urine for that is to take the double-edged file and place it in the extremity of the wool or cotton for good ligation; and you will insert the extremities of the file into the part below the syringe, and incise with forceps if there is any superfluous cause of the wool, but then introduce it into the canal with vehemence. And then you will bind the syringe with a bandage and album of cow.
And make the patient sit on a chair, and wrap the bladder with its groin in olive oil and olive water, and anoint it with oil of olives and aeguinros.
And then you will introduce the syringe facilitated until it reaches the root of the groin; and then you will double the groin below at the part of the navel; and then you will fill the syringe with that; and then you will fill it until it reaches the bladder, and that cures the patient of the void cause, and it is not done according to this order, but the meat in which it goes to tortuosity.
And then slowly extend the finger into the little woollen cloth, because the urine dries the little wool.
Then extract that and make it a cure for urine, and use a circle, do not stop until the bladder and the patient's thighs are alleviated.
Chapter 6.
About the quality of enema of the bladder with a clamp and similar instruments which are suitable for that.
When ulcers occur in the bladder or abscesses, or there is congealed blood in it, or it is obstructed by pus, and you want to distill waters and medicines into it, then make an instrument called a clamp, and this is its form.
But in the extremity of it is a hole, so it is closed. And in it there are three tubes: two from one part, and sometimes others.
At the beginning it is a concave place, in which there is what is being poured, and it follows according to the quantity that opposes it, until when some cause is withdrawn from the humidity, it is withdrawn, and when it is expelled, with water it is withdrawn, and when it is expelled long, according to what makes the clamp hold fast in the battles of the sea.
So when you want to draw humidity into the bladder, insert the extremity of the clamp into the humidity, and pull with that water which is poured into the upper parts, because the humidity is drawn into the cavity of the clamp.
And then insert the extremity of the clamp into the rod according to what we have recommended in the circle; and then pour the humidity with that water which pours, because this humidity passes into the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
Shape of the subtle syringe in which the bladder is syringed, and this is its shape:
And it is made of silver or of gold, of which the head plus also resembles a small feather, and there is a channel underneath for the ligament.
And then take the bladder in motion, and pause in it the humidity that you want to inject into the bladder, and then tie it between two strong ligatures with double thread, and heat that humidity over the fire.
And then insert the extremity of the syringe into the rod.
And then strengthen your hand over the bladder with the humidity in structured descent until the patient feels that this humidity has already passed into the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment and make it into that circle; and perforate it with all its retentiveness; and then insert strong thread into those tubes, so that they are revolved; and then add the circle so that it is also added to the relief, because you pause in that water which you want from the humidities, and olis and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and make it so that it is made like it was made for the bladder, and express with your hand until the humidity passes into the bladder.
Chapter 12.
About the extraction of stone.
We have already said in the division of the species of stone and cure of it with medicines, and the difference between stone generated in the kidneys and stone generated in the bladder, and their signs.
And we have said about the stone in which the surgical operation is done by hand, and the section.
And the stone generated in the bladder itself is that which is fixed in the bladder.
And I will now present it with a clear exposition and abbreviation.
So I say that stone generated in the bladder mostly affects children; and of its signs is that the urine which is ejected from the bladder is like water in its subtlety, and appears in that arena; and the patient feels his rod, and many times it is drawn, and then it is dressed; and in this way they have for a long time had pain in their anus.
And it is difficult to heal the health of children with that until they have reached 14 years; and it is a difficult cure in old people. But in young people it is easier for that because it is among those.
And of that which the stone is greater and the cure is more difficult; And if it is small, it is contrary to that.
So when we come to the cure of that, it is necessary at the beginning of that which we modify the patient with a syringe which extracts all the filth that is in the sick veins; because that filth sometimes prohibits the evacuation of the stone due to the investigation of it.
And then the patient is pressed with his own feet and is constricted and massaged below for so that the stone descends to the floor of the bladder, or jumps from its place sometimes.
And then make that circle between your prepared hands, and his hands are like the cinctures of it, so that the whole bladder is made to decline towards the lower parts.
And prepare that entire area beforehand.
So if you feel the stone in the space, then you touch it immediately with a dry cloth over it.
And if you do not feel the entire toe at once, then cover it with olive oil on the indicated spot of your left hand, if the patient is a child, or anointed finger if they are young and complete, and insert that in the hollow of the back. And prepare the stone to extract it from beneath the toe indicated. And convert that small thing little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And apply pressure above it on the indicated toe, and expel it through the parts beforehand you feel the pain.
And command the minister to press the bladder with their hand; and command another minister to extend their right hand downwards towards the genital area, and hold their other hand under the codena which is beneath the genitals, in the part where the pain is felt.
And then insert a spatulum between the skin to make an incision in the form of it: and divide the water that is between the back and the genitals, not in the middle place, but beside the left thigh; and the pain is about that stone and the indicated toe, and it is a transverse pain, so that the previous pain may be broad and stretched according to the quantity that you feel from the stone as possible, and no more, because you compress the indicated toe which has the stone in the back, and it is forgotten by its difficulty.
And you know that the stone has some corners and margins, because its extraction is made difficult by them.
And of that water it seems like a similar thing to a bean, and it is round, and it is made of the lighter extraction.
So if it's that one with corners and margins, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it's not forgotten, then cover that with a poultice, or strengthen around it in a decent gesture, the extremity of which is thus like a file on what you strengthen over the stone, and do not evacuate from it; or insert beneath it a subtle curved instrument.
But if you cannot operate on that, then you amplify the treatment a little, and if you see a flow of blood, separate it with a strong vitriol ointment.
But if the stone is more than one, then at the beginning you thrust your hand into the mouth of the bladder, and then insert it beneath it; and then thrust in a little water; and similarly it seems that there are many more than two.
And if it's a very large stone, then ignorance is that you insert it with great pain, because it happens to the patient for one of two causes: either death or it prevents the continuous flow of urine, because the place is not entirely consolidated.
But administer expulsion of it from within so that it is forgotten, or engage in the fracture of it with the forceps within to extract it by pieces.
So when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with enemas of aloe and dragon's blood, and strengthen it. And put on that drained pus in oil and wine, or in oil of roses and fresh water, so that the aposteme may be cooled down.
And then reposition the patient on their back, and do not disturb the bandage until the third day.
And when that has been disturbed, bathe the area with water and much oil, and then take care of it with gentle daily ointments and gentle daily balms until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs an aposteme of hot and corrosive nature, and it seems thus as if the blood is congealed in the bladder, and because of this the urine is prohibited (and this is known through the egress of the blood with the urine), then insert the indicated toe into the wound and extract that blood, because if it remains it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
And then wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and apply opposition to all species, with that which is convenient for its cure until it is healed.
And cover in the hours of all the cure that you read with both hands and adjust the medicines which are paused over the area.
And if the stone is small and it's in the middle of the bladder, and it's stuck in it, and the flow of urine is prohibited, then cure it with what you have recommended beforehand, because many times it happens that you feel pain; and already you have exposed this, and it is that you take a perforator of iron or steel, the shape of which is thus:
of triangular extraction, pointed, fixed on a handle.
And then take faith, and bind it to the bladder beneath the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then you thrust the iron into the wound, making a perforation so that the perforator goes to that stone. You rotate the perforator with your hand on that small stone little by little, and you perform the perforation of it until the other part's penetration is facilitated; for the urine will soon be absorbed.
And then you place your hand on that which is freed from the stone of the affected part before the wound, because it is drained, and it is flushed out with urine, and the patient is healed.
Perhaps this cure is not suited to you for some reason that prohibits it, then apply a fig leaf underneath the stone, and another fig leaf above the stone. And then you enclose the stone in that wound between two bandages. And then you extract it. And then you dislodge the ligament and clarify the congealed blood, which is done in the plague.
And it is not necessary to dislodge the fig leaf underneath the stone, but rather so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other ligament above, because when you dislodge the fig leaf, the calculus returns to its place and takes away the plague.
And therefore it is necessary for you to remove the fig leaf above, so that you elevate the stone to the upper parts, or return to your own complement, and take away the plague as we have said.
Chapter 16.
On the extraction of stones from women.
A stone in women is rarely generated.
Perhaps you see a stone in some of them, then the cure of it is difficult, and it is forbidden by many methods.
One of them is because the woman's strength is weakened.
And the second reason is that you do not find a woman who is skilled in science who can describe the measurement of the doctor when it is cast, or it is among women who have husbands.
The third reason is that you do not find a woman who is knowledgeable in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth reason is that the place of the surgical incision for stones in women is far from the place of the stone, because it requires a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
Perhaps it is necessary to provoke you to this, then it becomes known that you have taken a woman of middle science, and few are experienced.
Perhaps you are deprived of that, then seek a middle-quality woman who is subtle, or present a mature woman who is skilled in the affairs of women, or a woman who in this art has a share of the art.
Therefore make that present, and command to him that he do all that you will order, from the inquiry about the stone to the beginning; which cause is that it regulates if the woman is weakened, then it becomes known that he put his finger in her fundament and seeks the stone.
Therefore if you find that, cut away beneath his finger, and then command him to make an incision above that.
Perhaps if it is not weakened, then command the midwife to insert her finger into the cavity of the patient and inquire about the stone, since she places her left hand on the bladder, and takes it with good comprehension.
Therefore if you find that, then it becomes known that you gradually remove it from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts with gentle movements of your hand until you arrive at that point in the cavity.
And then you make an incision above that position of the majority of the cavity towards the point of the hollow of some part being stopped by him and sent to the stone in that part, and his finger is not removed from the stone, cutting away beneath it.
And the incision is small at the beginning; and then you insert the rod above that incision, and if you feel the stone, then adjust the incision according to the quantity which you know that the stone will be extracted from there.
And you know that the species of stones are many: because among them there is small and large, and rough and smooth, and long and round, and having ridges.
Therefore you know how many species are of it for that which you signify above that which you want.
And if you see a flow of blood, adjust the glass vessel in that place and leave it for an hour until the blood is absorbed, and then return to your operation until the stone is forgotten.
And make sure that you prepare yourself with the instruments which are said to be used in the extraction of stones from men, so that you may be helped by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which is incised, then you pause and sprinkle powder on the place and strengthen it with compresses and descent, and do not iterate that; and leave the stone and do not extract it, because if you weaken it, the patient will die. And then heal the wound.
When the sharpness of the blood is calmed, then place some warm cloths, and afterwards you return to your operation so that the stone is forgotten.
Chapter 62.
About the section on hernia treatment.
Hernia is not just an addition of humidity in the white bladder which is below the kidney containing the fluid, and it is called white bladder.
And some vegetables are in the proper pannicule which prepares nature at the part of the fluid, so that it is believed that there is another fluid; and it is the kidney between the white bladder which we have mentioned, and it is not anything but bitter.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the kidneys, so that at times it is found in this matter, and some veins are affected by percussion or a blow on the kidneys.
And this humidity has many colors, because the color of it is declining to citrus or blood-red, or red, or it is black and filthy, or it is whitish, and that is what is worst.
And the signs by which it is known that there is this addition of water are these: because if it is in the white bladder which we have mentioned, then the abscess is declining a little in length, thus forming a figure like a fluid, and the kidney appears, because the humidity contains all parts.
And if the humidity is in the proper pannicule, then the abscess is declining at the part of the fluid and thus one estimates that it is another fluid.
And if the humidity is between the kidney and the white bladder, then one feels it below the sentiment.
And when you want to know the color of the humidity, then you sprinkle the color of the humidity in the abscess amidst the crusty matter from which the form is preceded; and according to what has been examined in the vestige of the crusty matter, one judges that it is deduced from it.
So when we come to the cure of the iron deficiency, then it is necessary that we command the patient to take flea-bitters if it is possible for you, and sometimes the cost of the iron.
And then he should be suspended above two seats about some cause a little higher, and stop below the word drops.
And then you sit on the left side of it, and command the minister to follow on the right side of it, which extends its rod from two lateral lines to the kidney and to the part of the miracle of the belly.
And then take a wide spatula and separate the kidney from my own place for the length, in order to prop up the pelvis.
And make a section according to the rectified engagement of the line that divides the pelvis of the kidneys, until it reaches the white bladder, including.
And excavate that, and observe, and guard yourself so that you do not insert that; and your excavation is the one that excavates for the part just as it is suspended in the fluid worse and subtly scrutinized in the excavation according to the quantity possible for you.
And then pierce the full bladder of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate between the two labia of the section with unciae, and extend the bladder to the upper parts; and do not touch the kidney including, and insert the bladder in that manner which is possible for you. And insert it in its totality or in pieces, and enlarge the seat subtly, because if you do not precisely scrutinize the insertion of it, it is not made securely so that the water does not return.
But if the fluid proceeds from that defect of its kidney at the time of your operation, then when you have completed the section of the bladder, return to it, and then adjust the two labia of the kidney with a suture, and then heal it thus as the other wounds, until it is healthy.
And if you find the fluid corrupted by another disease, then it is necessary that you lift the vessels which are above the suspenders, and extract the fluid, and then heal it thus in the way that we have mentioned.
But if the water is added to two similar parts, then you know that two are the hernias; therefore insert that part according to what you have done in the other engagement; and if it seems to you that it is a work, then do it.
And then you purify the blood, and enter into the sections of the submerged lancet or in the rozated oil; and stop before another lancet which you have submerged in wine and oil, and expand it over two kidneys and the miracle of the belly; and stop above the double drops and powders, and bind them above the liament which is according to this form.
And then press two drops and fill the lancet with carmenated oil according to this resemblance; and make points on the extremities which are premised of cotton or humid lancet, and add them in structure to the breech of the breeches, and one of the extremities takes hold of the buttock up to the two, and the second takes hold at the part of the pelvis, and two extremities above two thighs below and two other extremities above two hips, and all the structure is adjusted in the breech of the breeches.
Some hernias are artificially medicated with cautery in the place of sectioning a vein; and it is that you take a subtle cutting cautery and insert it into the code of the genitals, and it is ignited according to what has been recommended until it discovers the white cicatrix containing water, and then you take cautery according to this form. and it is assembled with a Greek letter.
And then pierce that cicatrix, and it is ignited until all the humidity is driven out.
And then extend the cicatrix to the inch, and scrape it with an inch, and scrape it with a subtle ignited cautery; and insert it according to what is possible for you until you eradicate all of it; and beware of the hour when the fire does not touch.
And you know that this operation is more saving and more distant from flux of blood, and better than an operation with section.
But if you find an opposite aposteme that is cautious at the hour of section or at the hour of cautery, or flux of blood, then it is seen that you cure whatever opposite aposteme you have for that, with a curative treatment that is convenient to him according to what has been said.
But if the patient is poor, and does not expect a second operation due to its horror, then administer piercing according to what you have recommended; and it is when it is certified by you, for that which we have said about the signs, that this hernia is aqueous.
Then it is seen that you place the patient on some elevated seat, then pierce the aposteme at the lowest part of the spatium, and pause the piercing according to the length of the body.
And it is the wide perception until all the water corrodes.
And then pause over the short place and lift that and leave it there, so that the remainder of the water corrodes. And then cure it until the wound is healed.
But if the opposite is at the edge of the water at that hour you pierce it: and this is not done except to quarantine the white pannicle in the orifice of the wound, which makes an opposite and prohibits the issuing of the water, then it is seen that you put into the wound a penal instrument or one from which the water is extracted from the hydropips, the form of which is preceded; or adjust on the edge of the wound a small one.
And you know that the water returns, and it is augmented after six months or in those environments; and when it is augmented, then it is pierced according to that measured manner, because the patient will thus pass the seven days.

You know that in the section about this hernia, there is a lost fear of perniciousness in the major dispositions; because to me it has been seen the dismissal of it and being saved by that better one.
And you are remembering the operation on that and the species of the apostemes.
Therefore, I say that the apostemes are born in the bodies of those whose genitals are composed and it is done for many causes: either for acute superfusion of agrimony, which is abundant in the genitals, or for percussion.
And it is the color of the aposteme according to the color of the body, and it is not troubled in the pain, and it is a heavy aposteme.
And indeed it is an aposteme that is lapped, of which the color is dark, and it is not felt in it.
And some hernias are done for nodulation of the arteries, and for inflammation of those things that have already been perceived, or for inflammation of veins.
But that which is for inflammation of arteries is recognized by the dispersion of the aposteme when it comprehends them with the fingers of the tongue; and it does not touch that.
But that which is done for inflammation of a vein is not dispersed from it by any cause, unless the compression is with the fingers.
And it is possible that on this species a section was made and on the other carnal parts; and it is that you insert the code of the genitals, and then stop the hour at the divided parts above, and extract that from the white cicatrix, and release the suspensors of the veins, and tie them, and insert the suspensors so that you release that from all division of the parts of the hour.
Therefore, if the hour is already in those consolidated carnal parts, then it is seen that you extract the hour and insert it.
And if it is adhesion until some cause of the cicatrix, or between what is between the veins, then it is seen that you release all that adhesion and insert it for a rounded incision.
But if it is a birth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then it is seen that you insert all that which is of it, and extract the hour thus as we have said.
Then, since your operation is completed, then fill the wound with lanolin oil and rose water; and take care to heal that other wound properly so it may be healthy.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of hernia, which is a vital matter.
It is an abscess enveloped by a swelling similar to a bruise, which causes softening of the testicles, and makes difficult the exercise of movement and walking on the affected part.
And in the treatment of this illness it is necessary to fear for that water which is preceded by remembrance.
However, I believe that I should describe the operation in that second way that I did for the first ones.
And I say that you should place the patient on a raised chair; and then apply suspensors to the testicles at the lower parts; and then tie the cods of the genitals with threads in the form of little bags which are attached to the verge; and hold those other ministers that you have, and extend them with vehement extension.
And then insert a spatula under the agutta to make a cross-section in the right direction of the veins so that the veins are discovered.
And then scrape out the entire affected part thus as you have said in extracting the roots of the arteries which are in the temples.
And then place in those a needle in which there is double faith, and bind it to the first of the places where the vital spirit accumulates, and bind another one at the back of them. And then insert them in the middle place to make a right section according to the length of the body, and extract what is added by the foul and corrupt humors.
And then heal the wound with a cure of the other wounds in which you want to be healthy and not to be generated again, so that the veins may not become inflamed, for it is not bad for that.
But if the vital spirit accumulates in all the veins, then it is necessary that the testicles are extracted or that the testicles for that reason are removed from the veins, so that they are deprived of all nourishment for the growth of the veins, and that they are stabilized, or that they are removed so that they do not grow again in those.
Chapter 65.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is by section that ends in the extended ciphac above the belly on the part of the anguinary veins of the miracle of the belly, so that by descending the intestines of that rupture to some of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the ciphac or of the excretion of it, and it occurs in these two species for many causes: either by percussion, or by falls, or by shouting, or by elevation of some heavy cause, or by similarity.
And the sign of that, when it is by extension of the ciphac, is that it occurs little by little over a long time, and does not occur suddenly, and it is an abscess that engulfs within before the belly can comprehend that the ciphac has taken in the intestine.
And the sign of it is when it is by section of the ciphac, for at the beginning it causes vehement pain suddenly; and it is an abscess that appears diverse and apparent below the fallen cod, and that is by evacuation of the intestine, and the body of it is in the parts before the ciphac.
And some protrusions are forgotten in the intestine like a web, and this intestinal hernia is called zirbal.
And some protrusions are made in the ventosity, and some protrusions corrode in the intestine's end, and here it is retained, and it is with that great perniciousness of the illness, and some protrusions cause bad pain and worsening when it is premature.
And in the treatment of the species of this illness iron is feared, because it is necessary that the cauterization be avoided in that.
And the manner of the operation of that is to command the patient to reduce the intestine with their hand at the inner parts of their own cavity if they obey the return of their health, and then it is placed on the hollow column between their two thighs, and elevate their legs.
And then stop the cod (codpiece) which is the cod of the testicles at the upper parts, and insert the entire cod of the testicles for the whole length; and then place in two lips of the section uncis according to what is necessary to close the section with those.
And if the section is according to the quantity that you think it is possible that from that the hole may be forgotten.
And then scrape out that ciphaqueth which is beneath the cod of the testicles, until it is discovered the white hard ciphac from some part.
Then you insert the thread said in that which is the testicle, in that which is between the white ciphac, which is beneath the cod of the hole, and between the ciphac according to, and absolve with that adhesion which is in the part behind the hole.
And then you should put the mallet on the back of the testicles, and also extend the white membrane to the left side, and raise the bone to the corresponding part of the section; and command the minister to extend it further and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind the complete solution.
There is a search for the ties that make sure there is no cause of the intestine being wrapped in the white membrane during the duration. Perhaps you have found some cause of it, then you will fill that into the belly from below.
And then you sew up in the part behind the testicles for a section of which the flow of blood and sanity will also run, as we have recommended in what we have said.
And then you administer the submerged lancet in oil, and pause on the plague; and administer the ligature which we have recommended (and some times the white membrane is cauterized, which we have said to administer for the sake of the flow of blood, because many times it happens that they accumulate) and release the ligature so that it falls by itself.
Perhaps the delay of the treatment is late, then the warm water should be poured, and pause on that until it falls according to what we have said.
And then you heal the plague with another healing of the plagues until it is healthy.
Chapter 66.
On windy hernia.
In this hernia, it has not been seen that anything has been hardened under the treatment of the iron hammer.
And the first doctors said that it was done thus as we have recommended in the hernia that is at five; which is to place the veins near the section above the iron hammer that has been facilitated by it; and then you cut in the middle of the surroundings, surrounding the abscess with what overflows from there, until the veins fall.
And heal the plague according to what we have said until it is cured.
Chapter 67.
On the disruption that occurs in the ankle joints.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the ankle joints as we have said, and it swells up in that place.
And they do not point out any cause of the intestines to the genitals; and if they do, it is little; and it returns to its natural state in a few hours.
Perhaps if the time is prolonged in this, an adjusted fissure is made in the section so that it points out the intestine in the section; and it happens for the extension of the section which is in the ankle joints as we have said, which causes it to be extended, and then it becomes soft and pus-filled at the place and swells up.
And the treatment of it is with a cautery as we have previously described in the narrative of it.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this method: and it is that the patient lies on their back between the two hands, and then you cut the place of the rupture of the abscesses that swell up in a section according to the width of three fingers.
And then you strengthen the white membrane that is behind the intestine until it is discovered.
And then you take the rod and pause it on the prominent place of the section, and press it onto the belly button.
And then you kiss the two prominent places on the extremity of the rod of the section, and adjust one to the other with a suture.
And then you extract the extremity of the rod, and do not sew up the entire section, nor extend the bone, nor any other cause as we have said in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then you heal it with the treatment of plagues, and as you sew up the fibers, purify it and restore the plague until it is consolidated; because the section is constricted and not adjusted to the prominence of rupture.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is more conducive to health.
Chapter 68.
About the softening of the coding of the testicles.
The coding of the testicles is softened in some men who are affected by it, because the flesh that is between them is softened, and its examination is hindered.
Therefore it is necessary for one who is engaged in the cure of it to make the patient lie down according to his two hips, and to wrap the entire coding which is softened over the natural coding; and then adjust the two lips at the suture.
And if you wish, then in the beginning, apply a triple or quadruple bandage to the softened coding and make a firm suture.
And then insert between the sutures; and then heal by healing the other wounds within, so that it may be healthy and the veins may flow.
Chapter 69.
About Castration.
I know that castration is forbidden in our law, but I am led to remember it in this book; and the remembrance of it is not necessary except for two reasons: one is so that science may be known by the doctor who is expert in it, who knows its cure when it occurs; and the other reason is that we often need castration of other animals to improve our own stock, such as mules, cows, pigs, and similar beasts.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by attrition or by section of the seed.
Moreover, in that which is done by attrition, the way of operation is that we make the animal stand still in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then take those with your hand within, so that they are resolved and do not appear to be touched.
Moreover, in castration done by section and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the coding of its testicles with your left hand.
And then tie the suspenders, and insert above each tube in one section until two tubes are processed.
And then insert those pus that you will have extracted from somewhere. And do not leave any of the cifix on the body for any reason, except the subtle cifix which is above the veins.
And in this manner of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition strongly loosens the coding of the testicles so that the animal desires to couple.
And then heal the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
About the cure of Hermaphrodosia.
Hermaphrodosia in men is according to two ways: one is when it appears in that which occupies the space in the coding of testicles, in which there is a figure of a woman's cunt, which they feel.
And some veils of that cord obstruct the urine which is in the coding of the testicles.
Moreover, in women it is a species: and it is that the cunt of the woman on the perineum is similar to two testicles of a man, a little smaller in all its miniatures, and similar to the perineal partition of a man and two testicles.
And the cure is of three species: two from men and one species from women. And it is necessary that you insert those flesh adjusted until the impression of that is effused, and then you cure with the cure of the other wounds.
And in the second species of men from which urine flows, which is in the coding of the testicles, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 71.
About abortion and prominent flesh caused by women.
Abortion is strongly adjusted according to natural causes until it is extinguished and is done with legitimate examination; and some veils are magnified in some women so much that they spread like in men and perceive during coitus.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold the abundance of abortion with your hand or with a hook and insert.
And do not push too far in the insertion, mainly on the root of the uterus, so that there is no efflux of blood.
And then heal with the cure of wounds until it is healed.
Moreover, a born flesh is a flesh that grows in the horrifici of the mother until it fills that, and strongly it is said to be similar to the parts of the father according to the semblance of coitus (and for this reason some first call it "malautia caudada"); therefore it is necessary that we insert thus as we insert abortion, and heal it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
About the cure of gout.
Gout is when the cunt of the woman is not perforated, or it is a small passage. It is either natural or accidental.
The accident is due to a previous bad habit, which was done either for unadjusted flesh or for subtle and thin skin.
It is done either in the belly of the mother, or in the sides of it, or in the higher pus of it, or in the lower pus of it, and prohibits from acquiring and from pregnancy, and strengthens the prohibited menses.
And the recognition of that is done by examination of the uterus, if the obstacle is apparent, it will be cleared; but if it's not apparent, then you seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstacle is due to subtle and thin skin, it will be cleared by the two lips, then you will touch and break apart that.
And it is that which stops above the two lips of the vulva, and then you pause with your fingers indicating from both hands the most inward places.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then extend the two lips of the vulva inward so that the subtle and thin skin is broken and the obstacle is cleared.
And then take a lancet and open the four veins in oil and pause that on the spot, and hold it at home for a day so that the spot does not become inflamed.
But if the skin is thick and dense, then it is necessary that you make an incision with a spatula or a scalpel of myrtle.
But if the obstacle is due to flesh, then suspend it with an onion, and make incisions there.
And here are the medicines that stop the flow of bloody wounds, such as achatia, and dragon's blood, and others, adjusted to the white album of wolf's hoof.
And then administer a wide poultice of soft lead so that the wound does not become consolidated too quickly.
And hold it for several days and administer cooling water to the affected area.
And then it is cured with another cure of consolidation until it is healed.
And some old wise men have fallen into the native birth of other flesh, and then it is necessary that you make incisions according to this method. But if it is for aposteme cancers, to the cancerous aposteme which is in the belly and should not be done with iron in any way.
Chapter 83.
On the cure of hemorrhoids and of tailor's and red botcher's that occur in the groin of women.
Hemorrhoids are appreciated from the orifices of many veins inward, so that from those orifices continuous blood flows out; and how ancient hemorrhoids are and are made tailor's.
And I have already said in the division of the species of those and their signs, and I will say thus about those that receive cure and those that do not receive cure.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and tailor's are when they are in the belly of the mother and do not appear to the sense, then in those no iron cure should be made.
But those that are in the orifice of the mother above which the sentiment is felt, those are the ones that can be cured.
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a warm bath and then extend the tailor's to the orifices, or with rough cloth, and make incisions there at the roots.
And then powder over those with the flow of blood from one of the pulverizing incisions, thus with cassia and similar to those.
And then steep the soles of the feet for an hour, and then pause that in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make that seize in decoction of sumac and of scorched millet and of walnuts and of similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and wine, and make a plaster to apply over the back of it.
And if the blood is absorbed, good; and if not, make adhere to two ventilators, and to the nipples their scarifications.
And then take a lancet and submerge it in juice of colyander or juice of arnagloza or juice of guarriver with five pinches, and make adhere to the spot; and then cure the spot with an ointment until it is healed.
And cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 84.
On the perforation of accidental injuries in the belly.
Many species of apostemes occur in the belly, such as cancer and aposteme lapident and ulcers and adhubelations and erpetromenons and fistulous hemorrhoids and raguaries and thyl and other apostemes. And I have already said about these bad habits and the species of those and their signs, and their cures in the division.
I know that you want to dig into this treatise about abscesses, which is the main topic of this book, where I will discuss the apostemes that collect pus, and if you want to know how to perform the operation on a patient with a fever.
Then you should consider whether the pain of the abscess in the initial stage is acute with percussion and inflammation, and sometimes it grows worse, and if you feel something on that sentiment, then do not make a perforation, but rather cure it by helping to mature the contents until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
And then you should make the woman sit on a chair that has two chairs; and recline her back on the cushion, adjusting her feet to the partition below the belly, and her thighs are expanded, and place her arms below the knees, and tie something around her to keep it in a convenient position.
And then the midwife follows on the right side and administers the instrument with which the orifice of the matrix is opened, in the form that will be seen in those causes that will be treated afterwards.
And know when you want to administer this instrument that you place it in the radius of the matrix of the woman's womb, and ensure that part of the instrument that enters the womb is not larger than the radius of the womb and the patient's thigh. But if the instrument is larger than the radius of the womb, then you should pause and apply poultices on the texture of the radius of the womb so that it prohibits the entry of the entire instrument into the womb.
And know that you should pause the vertebral column that runs on the instrument from above and that the minister holds the instrument and revolves the vertebral column until it opens the orifice of the womb.
And when the extraction appears, and it is touched by the hand and it is smooth and soft, then you should know that you have succeeded in removing the head of the fetus with a spatula.
And when the placenta is evacuated, then you should know that you pause in the wound a submerged cotton or oil rose or oil green where there is some stipulation; and place the calcium in the section of the womb.
And pause before the womb and above the perineal area a clean cotton submerged in water where there are swollen veins.
And then it is cured, then two days with a poultice that converges to that which is healthy until it is healed.
And some vegetables are washed with the womb and the wound in such a way that they are crystallized in water and honey, and then in water where there is dissolved root of iris or long aristology, and then it returns to the poultice.
And if the wound is deeply ingrained in the womb, then you should know that you are prohibited from curing it with iron, unless you have a cure for that which we have said in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives how to handle embryos that are not naturally formed, according to the non-natural figure.
A necessary cause is that the midwife knows in the beginning the figure of natural infant development for signs of it, and it is that when you see the woman expressing desires below and wants to smell the air, and about that which is joined above her by part, and feels the sentiment of the embryo, then you know that this part is according to natural figure, and it is the sentiment of it on the womb's head, and the second sign is either suspended or pendant from the umbilical cord.
So when you see these signs, then you know that the belly of it is comprehended so that the embryo descends lightly and easily when they are above the womb's head, they give it the second sign, and it is freed from those superfluous abundances with good moderation.
But if that part is not natural and not removable, because when the embryo is situated on its feet and the body of it is situated in front of its head and its feet, and its hand is one, or at its foot. or it is situated with its head and hand, or at its belly, and it is strongly converted on the womb's neck, and it seems like the figures of its non-removable parts.
A necessary cause is that the midwife should be wise and subtle in all those causes, and that she guards against error and deception.
And you show the entire figure of those, and which engine is in those so that it is signified for that and it is established on that.
When the fetus is situated on the womb's head by natural gravity, and it is vehement against the woman and makes a difficult part, and sometimes its virtue is already debilitated, then make that seizure, or women have it, and evaporate its conjunction with fenugrec cotyledon and olistic humectants.
And then insert the measure between the womb's fingers, a small spatula and find that in the second sign, or dry that with its own nail until it correlates what is in it of humidity. Empty the womb of the woman so that she may expel the fetus.
Maybe if not expelled, then it is necessary that the woman be treated with a poultice of soft plaster and a poultice of fig tree gum in cinnamon.
And command it to come out, and compress the uterus, so that it be overwhelmed and that stormy humor be expelled with consent; and close its mouth and nostrils for an hour, because the fetus will be forced out almost immediately.
And if the two parts of the fetus are not fully expelled at the beginning, then it is necessary that you reduce them gradually, facilitating their small pieces. Maybe if the instrument does not obey, then stop the woman on a chair and lift her feet up, and place the chair firmly on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall during the concussion.
And if the pieces are not yet turned and the fetus is dead, then cut into them and extract the remains of the fetus or take out the body to the hand of the one who is pulling and extracts that which is equal in size, because it will be forced out.
When the fetus is stuck on the pregnant woman's feet, then it is necessary that you push them upwards, and turn the fetus little by little, and try to dislodge it, and take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
Maybe when they are stuck inside the thighs, then you command it to come out, and make that extreme effort with consent, because it will be forced out if God wills it.
And if it is not forced out in that way which we have recommended, then you return the fetus little by little into its natural position, so that it will be easier to deliver later.
And if it is prohibited to do all that we have recommended, then take a poultice of altaea and dissolved gum, and beat everything in the mortar for good percussion, and place it on the womb of the woman, below her belly. And make that mixture into a warm bath, until you obtain the desired hypochondria.
And when the separated parts are cleansed, then make a sub-fumigation of myrtle and pause that on it. And when you make the sub-fumigation for an hour, then place it on a chair, and make that stormy humor be expelled, and close its mouth, and lift it from there, and press the part down below her belly with gentle compression, because the fetus will soon be forced out.
Removal of the fetus laterally while being held by one of her hands. It is gently reduced with the hand of the one who is pulling, maybe if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk around.
And if walking is not possible, then make her lie on the sheet, and shake her thighs with vigorous concussion, and then administer gentle treatments which you have recommended and soft poultices.
And if the labor has come, then make her sit on a chair, and place it above the reduction of the hand, and hold the fetus according to its natural position, and make the woman expel and command it to come out so that it is forced out.
Removal of the fetus from the expanded womb with its hands and the surface of it is on the back of its mother. That the midwife holds the hand of the fetus and then revolves it little by little, and that makes it easier.
And when it is thus and you have held it, then stop on the womb of the woman with what we have recommended of oils and poultices.
And then command it to be gently held little by little, and when you have done that, then make her sit on a chair and command it to be inclined over the right thigh, and then command it to be compressed; and make that stormy humor be expelled with consent. The prepared fetus is turned onto its side.
When the horror of the mother is thus according to this manner, consider it, and then you cut into the second one with your finger until it is evacuated of humidity.
And if you place a net above the patient's face and neck, then insert that into the belly, so it is not retained and does not die.
Then apply poultices to the patient's divided parts inside so that it pauses that which covers, and send for the woman who compresses some vegetables, and the sir will forget the worst symptoms, if God wills it.
The departure of twins or the abortion of many fetuses. You know that twin births are rarely natural, and some births are not normal, three or four, but it is strange and bitter to endure; but I know the causes are against nature, and do not live.
And count them, already it seems that they are multiplying, a second time, and are separated by a ligament, distinguishing those that enter the umbilical cord of each one of them. Some births are against nature, and thus it is as if it were a natural fetus for a better outcome, and thus some births are for an unnatural outcome, just like we have recommitted.
And if they are difficult cases of childbirth and come to what we have said about unnatural figures, then you cure them thus as we have recommitted.
And if the midwife is subtle and does what she does to facilitate and subtlety, and delays, and is ingenious according to the entire figure as it is prepared by the engendering mother for health.
The memory of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Some poultices are formed on the hand in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more ways, and I have already verified that a woman who has had an abortion does not get seven, and another X-shaped poultice causes false measurement of the glorious savors.
And all that is covered because it is in the science of the midwife who strongly holds to that small similar thing, and therefore operates on it as I hold.
Chapter 76.
On the extraction of the dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medicine and it is not beforehand existed, and you are forced to use opposing operations on me, then I think that you consider whether the woman is of healthy virtue and not among those accidents for which she is threatened with loss.
Then it happens that the woman is placed on her back on the two pillows, and her head is inclined downwards and her thighs are elevated.
And the midwife holds that of two parts or is tied to the pillow so that the body of the woman does not extend beyond the extraction of the fetus.
And then you apply to the mother's mouth of it, oil of olive and mucus of flaxseed and of fenugreek and of sesame of those.
And then the midwife puts her hand on those oils and mucus, and then inserts her hand to facilitate in the mother, and then seeks the hand in the place where the nails are in the fetus.
And convenient places in that: then you consider if the fetus is prepared to descend onto the pillow head, and then you put the nails in its heels, or in the neck, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or under the beard, or in the armpit, or in the proper places of the ribs, or under the hypochondries.
More if the descent is onto its feet, then in the perineum, or in the middle of the ribs.
And it happens that you hold the nail with your right hand, and pause the curvature of it in that place which is between the fingers of your left hand, and then insert your hand to facilitate and put the nail in some of those places which we have said, until you reach the boyish cause.
And then pause and put in the application of its another nail, or the third if it is necessary, so that it is attracted equally, and not extended according to its rectitude only.
And thus it is worked on the entire part, so that the outcome of it is alleviated thus as it is done in teeth, for the eradication of it.
And it happens that in that which is between them, the extension is mollified; and if some part of it is retained, then it happens that the midwife puts some of her fingers on oil and inserts those expertly and revolves on that which is retained.
Then if the part of the fetus is forgotten, then the nails are permuted into the place where it was put out; and thus it happens until the entire fetus is forgotten.
More if the hand is exhausted beforehand by the other, and it is not possible to reduce that by the contraction of it, then it happens that the drap is enveloped over that; and then extract that until the entire thing is forgotten, and insert that or in the joint of the hand or in the hip.
And thus it happens that the swelling occurs on the other hand and in both feet.
Perhaps if the head of the foot is large, or it happens that the contraction occurs in the tissues, or it is in the head of the adjusted water, then it happens that the intervening space between the spinal vertebrae is closed and the head is extracted and the water is expelled, or that which is discovered by an instrument called "alundat", the form of which will be seen in the forms of other instruments in the chapter that is about to come.
And similarly, it happens that the foot is of large head by nature: and then it happens that an abscess is formed there, or that one takes out the adjusted water in this way as we have said; and then extract the bones with the forceps.
And if the head is swollen and contracted towards the knee, then it should be opened until the humidity that is in the foot is evacuated.
Perhaps if it is not complicated, nor does it obstruct the tissues, then you will incise the head as soon as possible according to your skill.
And if the intestines of the belly are apostemated or are in a hydropic state, then it happens that you will perforate them until you correct the humidity that is in them.
Perhaps if the foot is upon the six inches, then the traction of it is lighter and the direction of it to the mouth of the matrix is lighter.
Perhaps if it is contracted towards the belly and the foot, then it happens that you will extract that which has wrapped around your hand, and that you will open the belly and the foot until what is in them is corrected.
Perhaps if the other members are numb and turned towards the head, then the measuring instrument intervenes in the left hand; perhaps if the mouth of the matrix is open, then insert the hand in the hollow of the liver, and search for that which is near the head, and bring it towards the spinal vertebrae until it reaches the mouth of the matrix, and then intervene with one inch, or two inches, and bring it out from them.
And if the mouth of the matrix is contracted due to an apostema which adheres to it, then it happens that one should not trouble it further; instead, it happens that one should administer an effusion of humid, greasy causes. And apply emplasters; and follow the patient with waters that mollify and humect.
And if the foot is on the sixth rib, then if it is possible, it should be agitated: and administer what we have said in the foot vivified.
And if that is not possible, then it should be incised in several places, and extracted.
And it happens that you will not leave any underlying cause of the disease.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we have said about the cure of the apostemas caused by the matrix.
And if it causes a flow of blood, then apply styptic waters and administer another cure.
And I have seen a woman in the belly of whom was born dead, and then upon that same spot another conceived embryo, and then the dead foot was born again. It happens that at length of time an apostema occurs in the seventh womb; and it swells until it becomes full, and begins to cut short the arm.
And I was called to cure him, and I treated him for a long time, and the plague is not consolidated.
Then I paused on him about several causes of emplasters of strong attraction, and extracted one bone from him, and then passed some days, and extracted another bone; and I was too marvelously surprised, as if there were no bones in the belly.
And then I realized that they were from the bones of the dead foot.
Then I understood the plague, and extracted many bones from him, the woman existing in the seventh thousand disposed milieux, and I had seen it in such a manner for a long time, corrected of one small arm.
And I did not affirm that it was strange, but rather that in this there is science and help to do with the artificial hand on my own hand for administering cure.
About the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the foot.
Form of vertex in which the matrix is opened:
This is the form of the stretcher on which the books are bound, to which binding two vertices are in both extremities of two feet. Perhaps the emperor made this vertex so that it might be put more subtly under the stretcher, and it was done either of ebony or of wood from boys.
And it is the width of each wood that has two inches and a margin of each one that has an inch, and the length of each one is a palm and a half; and in the middle place of two woods there are two adjustments of those same woods which were fixed, of which the length is the measure of a palm and a little more, and the width of each one is two inches, or a little more.
And in this case, you should add two tablets to the mouth of the mother (patient) so that it is opened when you turn the prescribed virtues.
Another form appears more subtle and lighter:
It is made from the juice of ivy or of boxwood, according to the similarity of its strength. You should apply it to the extremity of the patient, adding thus at times, and the length of those additions is about a palm, and their width is two fingers.
And when you want to open the patient, then you make the woman sit on a low stool with her feet pendant, opening what is between their thighs. And then place your hand on the instrument thus with tongs in engagement according to the quantity that you want of the appreciation of the patient's mouth, until it reaches so that you want.
The way to administer the virtues that the ancients described:
Form of impelling in which the foot is anointed:
Form of massage in which the big head is constricted:
And it is assembled with tongs that grasp the extremity, thus at times, and some veins are opened thus as tongs according to this form, thus at times, which grasp thus as grasping of rescue in which it is incised and constricted. Form of gentle massage:
Form of a hook having a spine:
Form of a hook having two spines:
Form of a spatula having two extremities in which the head is separated:
Form of two wide spatulas:
All those instruments are exercised, and when I multiply the species of that and prepare them with artifices, as it is lighter in their operation and more useful to men for their quantity.
And do not think that those instruments are so well prepared, because the necessity of those is not excusable.
From the extraction of the secondine.
When the secondine is retained by the enfantament, then it is necessary that you command the patient to retain their urine, and then make them stir in condition, and strengthen your hand over the patient's mouth and over their nostrils, and if thus it is deformed, well it is.
And then, you take a cloth and perforate in the cover a tube and pause on that herb which opens the patient's mouth, thus with calmant and rough and anet and camomile and scented Arabic and Cassia lignea and Santal. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water in the cloth, and pause that over the flame.
And then pause a cane of Canary grass in the patient's mouth, and hold that until the vapor comes to the cavity of the patient.
And then make them stir thus as I have said, and the secondine will be forgotten with velocity.
You should continue this cure and it is not forgotten, then you command the matrona to submerge her left hand in oil of Sizami or in mucilage of altaea, and then insert that into the jug and scrape there with that secondine, and when that aura is found, then take it out and extend it little by little. If it is annexed in the prison of the patient, then insert your hand according to what we have recommended, and when you have found the secondine, extract it little by little according to rectitude so that the patient does not fall into vehement attraction. Beforehand, I want that the right and left costs are facilitated.
And if the patient's mouth is constricted, we have recommended the cure with stuttering and medication of the cloth with herbs.
You should not forget all the causes that we have recommended, then beware that you do not fatigue over that in iteration of abstraction, but I command that what is issued from him to the patient's mouth lies at the thigh of the woman, and then crystallize that in enguent and tetrafarmacon; because it will make it dissolve and be forgotten.
You should know that when they are dissolved, it is of the elevated bad odor at the head, and at the stomach, and that leads to the illness; and then I command that they be administered sub-fumigation and convenience according to that.
You should know that some of the Ancients already used sub-fumigation of nitrate and of dry figs.
Form of instrument in which the woman is sub-fumigated for the retention of menses and of the secondine:
It is made from glass or from iron.
The extremity is placed subtly in the basin and the larger extremity is placed over the focus, and the subtle fumigation is placed over the arms of the focus.
You hold that within which is consumed by that subtle fumigation and then proceeds to another.
Of the care of the unperforated anus of the infant.
Many infants are born with their anuses not perforated, which have a subtle and obstructed passage. Then the midwife should carefully perforate the anus with that finger; and if not, she should perforate that narrow space, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
And then place a bandage over that inflamed area with wine and oil; and then take care of that narrow channel until it is healthy.
But if you fear it may become obstructed, then place a cannula in the tract for many days, and wait until the infant is strong enough to expel.
And then an obstruction of the anus occurs due to consolidation of plague or aposteme; then it is necessary that this consolidation be cut into, and then be cured with what we have said about the care and the poultice.
Of the care of the fistulas that occur below.
The fistulas that occur in the lower part below form a low node and become thick, those which occur near the anus or in the space of one part.
And it is a fistula or many.
And when that node is ancient and corroded by the acidic white humidity or subtle purulence, and some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate.
And those penetrating ones are recognized by what is ejected from them through the exit and by wind sounds; and some of them use the bad humor of ejection, and it is ejected from those worms.
And some of those fistulas penetrate into the space penetrating to the bladder, and into the flesh of the penis; and some of those penetrating ones enter into the joint of the hip and into the notch of the coccyx.
And that in which the penetrating fistula is recognized entering into the anus and not-penetrating, is that you place your finger inside the anus, and you insert a subtle thread of iron or of iron in the fistula when it is not twisted.
But if it is twisted, then insert a subtle thread of lead or of horsehair until you feel the thread or the hair in your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all and there is no progression of the tract for any cause of evacuation or worm or wind, thus as we have said, then you will know that it is non-penetrating, and then you should proceed to the care.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the flesh of the penis, then the sign of it is the emission of urine from that and prohibition of it until the place where medicine is consolidated.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the hip or into the bone and causes pain in the circuit, then the sign of it is that the thread passes through here if it is not twisted into the bone, and causes pain in the circuit of the part; and that sometimes it produces pus; and that it does not respond to that medicine, nor is it consolidated with the channel.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the care of them is troublesome and vain effort of foolish doctors about which they boast.
But in that which is not penetrating and not ancient, health is iron-bound and scattered according to what you have recommended, and that which has already been and proceeds.
And it is that the bad humor goes between your hands over the two fingers and raises its legs towards them, the hips are inclined to the belly, and then you insert a thread of lead, or of iron if it is in the twisted fistula, until you feel the place where the thread passes through.
And if it feels the bad humor around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your finger inside the anus.
And if you feel with your finger the thread that has been inserted to discover penetrating, or what you feel between your finger and the anus, then you will know certainly that it is penetrating; and then do not bother with it, because it is not in that health, thus as we have said.
But sometimes some of them are healthy in some homes where they are tart.
And of the medicine by which they are suddenly helped in that is that you ignite subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, thus as it has been preceded, and you insert that ignited thing into the fistula until it penetrates around the anus; and then it will take two or three weeks until you know that all those adjusted carns, fistulized and resembling a feather of a bird's wing, are completely healed.
And then you care for that with calques enveloped in bandages until all those adjusted carns are visible, and then you care for that with medicines that engender and consolidate the flesh, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it is not healthy at any time through another cure.
If the tension goes inside and does not penetrate into the thigh where it is in the back of the knee, and between that and the tension which is almost entirely flesh or cartilage, and sometimes a fistula forms on the surface of the codena, then dry the codena from the beginning of the fistula, and you see the drying of the tension, and it is in the fistula until the drying pervades to the place where it affects the extremity of the tension, and for the tension is liberated and freed.
And then you should clean those festering wounds which are assembled around the canal of painful anguish and do not remove any cause from those wounds.
Maybe the flow of blood sometimes comes between you and your operation when you are cauterizing those wounds, then the thousand things that are and of the pus lie in the sharper instrument to cauterize with fire or acute medicine, because the cautery adjusts well to good habits: so it is adjustment of those adjusted wounds, and removal of the blood from excessive humidity.
And then you should cure those wrapped-up ulcers in a bandage or in a truss that goes to the place of the arm, and then cure the plague with a hard, enduring, and consolidating flesh.
And these medicines are those which are stimulating and purging; when then it is restored, it is already healed and does not fear relapse.
Maybe the fistula has already penetrated into the groin of the back and is elongated from the surface of the body, then enter the thigh within the back and investigate in that.
And so if you hold the tension and between you and it is almost cartilage or flesh, and it is ready for penetration, then it is not an operation on him but rather a path of trust and hope.
The cause is to administer in him one of three ways: either to cauterize that thus as we have said; or to dry that until you obtain the conquest of his body so that it is possible for you to enter the vessels and the propounded cure; and do not proceed with more drying lest you irritate the contained liquid, and that agrees with the malice of the governing will; and then cure that thus as we have said because strong sir health; or elongate that almost entirely and remove that pus which dries that until towards the back, thus as we have said, either with a pointed instrument or another sharp extremity, and then clean those festering wounds which are in the drying into the one who can make an incrustation; and then strive to do the restoration of all the plague in the drying, and if the horrific pus above is not consolidated, and remove the fistula opened in the part of the back, and it will be lighter for the malice. And sometimes the fistula is finished according to this method: it is when you enter the tension into the fistula, and it is in the width of the back around the surface of the body at the codena and in the margin of the back, then take the pointed extremity of a perforating instrument, which is like a needle prepared to open the veins according to this form.
and enter into that wrapped-up vein of five veins or around those; and then enter the tension into the vein in the fistula until you obtain the conquest of his body.
Maybe it is penetrating into the margin of the back near the teeth, then you extract the vein from that tract thus that you enter the thigh within the back; and you extract the extremity of the vein and adjust the two extremities together, and strengthen each one, and leave it like that for a day or for two, and when maybe you insert the vein into the flesh, strengthen it until those flesh are inserted which are between the two extremities of the vein and which fall.
And then cure the plague until it is consolidated and healed.
Maybe the horrific fistula does not penetrate, then make it penetrate in some way you are prepared, but not much in the groin, because it is not for you to do that lest you irritate the contained liquid; and then make it enter until it is healed.
The form of the spatula is like this which is bound to the fistula: the curvature of which is very sharp and the other part is not-sharp, so that you do not irritate what is not necessary, thus sometimes.
About the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows during the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are thus according to two methods, because either they are between the back resembling thus that it is of carbon, or those are like a fat of rasp. And of those are small and large, and the blood flows from them sometimes and it is one, and they are many, and they are outside the back, and in the extremities of him.
Maybe those that are outside the back according to the months of little humidity, from which flow water or a little blood with continuous flow, and thus according to the color of the body.
And the cure of that which is near the back is that you command the malice to settle and to expel it until the back is dry and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you will feel and suspend an inch above that which you hold in your fingernail, and then cut those veins from their roots.
Perhaps the nails are not held in those for their humidity and softening, then take them with a rough cloth or a cotton pad, and extract them from the tender skin, and then cut them and powder over the burned areas with powdered caustics according to the incision; or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cauterizing. And then heal those with another cure until they are healthy.
And if the anus does not obey evacuation, then sprinkle the patient with a powder in which there is a small amount of absinthium, and wash them with that water which is in the colon and which helps to evacuate more easily when the patient is straining.
Perhaps the hemorrhoids are in front of the anus, then the cause of them is evacuation, and it is that you take those with your fingernail, or take those with an inch, and cut them, and then heal those with water which we have mentioned until they are healthy.
And to the one who has an incision, it is necessary to administer a suture of them according to this method: take a thread wrapped around and insert it into a needle, and then extract the hemorrhoids from the upper parts, and make it penetrate into the needle in the root of the other part, and wrap the two extremities of the thread around the area below the needle, and so latitudinally; and strengthen the hemorrhoid in strong structure, and then knot the thread and extract the needle.
And make them all whole, and leave one of those open and not sewn, so that the superfluity of blood can flow out from it.
And then stop above the anus with a cloth infused with rose oil or wax; and place that on the colon and command the patient to rest. And then leave it until it crusts; and when it falls off, heal those with an ointment or another cure until they are healthy.
And since they are antiquated and do not have value in that medicine, then it is necessary to root them out with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are humid and held back by the scab, which prohibits their consolidation; and then heal those until they are consolidated.
Then you will remove those with reason, forcefully, that the first time until much blood flows and they are excavated; and then heal those until they are healthy.
You know that gout, this is clear, and it is not so if you do not notice the swelling according to the color of the body resembling a club hand, and it is made in all the body and especially in the parts below the feet and toes, and it ends for those who have that pain.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circuit of the vein be cut, and held with forceps or an inch, and eradicated from its root; and then heal that.
And if you want, cauterize the vein as described in the seventh chapter.
Perhaps a verruca is a small, rough, rounded fistula on the surface of the body, and soft medicines come in the hands of infants.
And the cure of it is that you extend and cut them out, or that you strengthen them with a thread or a hair until they crust. And if you want, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.
Perhaps a formica is a small, rough, gross fistula on the surface of the body, and when it touches that, it is felt in the likeness of a burning of ants, and it is made around the body.
And the cure of it is that you take a tube of pea or of nut, and make it strong, and place it over the formica until it contains the circle of the tube around the parts of it; and then revolve your hand with the tube until you cut what is in the circuit of the formica, and place it in the flesh of the patient, and eradicate the formica from its root.
And if you want, make it with a tube of iron or copper according to this method:
The part below the tube should be subtle, solid (not perforated), wrapped so that on the said part the absorption of it is abolished and the revolution of it.
And if you want, cauterize the formica according to what has been previously said in the cauterization of atheyl in the chapter on cauterizing.
In the manner of instruments that are administered to give Christ's cross.
Some crosses are made of silver or gold or copper foundry or alloy; and some crosses are made of those small and large instruments according to those that are administered, because the one that is administered for the treatment of small children should be small; and of those whose buttocks are fragile or delicate, the crosses of those should be small.
The form of large and few Christ's crosses:
The head of the cane of the patient from underneath which the bandage is wide according to this method; and it should be at a distance where the bandage is tied in this way sometimes.
And the extremity of the pulse below, which is inserted into the buttock, should be subtle (not exposed) like a lion, subtly; and on one side of the thigh there are two channels, and on the other side one channel, and the width of the channel is according to the size of the roots and thus a small one.
And the bandage in which the medicines of bladder of beast or of sheep's skin are wrapped, and the width of it should be a palm.
And it should be pierced for many channels, just as it is revolving; and if the space which is between the channels is very large according to the finger.
And then insert into those channels a strong thread of crude fiber which is of two fibers, or around them; and adjust it on the bandage; and when it is wrapped on the patient, it should be stretched at the head of the cross between two distinct and strongly constricted points, and then cross it on each channel: The quality of crossing on each channel is that you fill the bandage with medicine, which should be warmed according to the quantity of the tolerance of the patient; and beware that it is not too hot nor too cold.
And then the patient should be resupinated on his back, and elevate his legs up and place one body part above him or a lantern; and then apply the extremity of the cautery with oil or album of water or mucilage of fenugrec or of similar things; and then insert that into the buttock to facilitate, and then the minister takes the bandage and extracts it with two fingers and seven times with vehemence until it is evacuated from the intestine as much as is in the Christ's cross; and then remove the Christ's cross and the patient raises his legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces it to evacuation, hold it as much as you can; and if he sleeps through the whole night, it is more certain in its juvenation.
More so if you cross it on the patients of solution of belly and evacuation of the intestine, then you iterate the cautery until it is healed.
And if in the buttock there are morbid or putrid abscesses, then the Christ's cross should be subtle and gentle, one of those Christ's crosses with which children are treated.
Of the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds what is convenient to the book, and I have said thus the treatment of those with mother and medicines according to the complement.
So I say that wounds are diversified according to what they are made of and according to the place on which they occur.
And the causes why many wounds are made of such things as the blow of a stone, or incision of space, or percussion with a lance, or a fist, or a dagger, or similar to those of many causes.
More wounds that are in the places of the body such as a wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the thigh, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I have recommended the treatment of some wounds because it pauses that reasoning and rule about the other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, because the remembrance of the composed will come to the beginning of the third chapter.
So I say that when simple head wounds occur and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from a blow of a stone or similar, and has already torn the scalp so much and it is a great wound and there are fears about that patient having an apostema cut, then you should remove the cephalic suppuration as soon as possible, and do not delay; and extract according to the quantity of the virtue of the blood if there is no prohibitive cause for phlebotomy, especially if the blood that is extracted from the wound is little.
And it should be phlebotomy of the opposite part of the wounded area; and beware of the patient's replenishment and of wine and of thick broths.
More so if from the minute you prohibit some cause, then it should be diminished of the wine and not approached to meat nor to wine.
And stop on the wound, if it occurs with apostema cut, then inject olive oil or wine in which there is stipptic.
Most surely it is secure to apply a warm poultice, then pause on the affected area, if it recently happened in the last six hours and the air has not changed that powdery thing which you recommend to apply small.
And if the air has already changed that powdery thing, then pause on the swollen gums until it is healed.
Most surely if the wound is large or is from a spacious and similar injury, and not just the lips of it are adjusted for pustules, then adjust them with a suture according to how you recommend for the suture of theirs.
Most surely if the wound has discovered the bone and pen, and it does not retain its own except for a small suspensor, then incise that and apply careful cure to the wound with medicines and restore the flesh properly in place of cartilage, and command the patient to be moderate in victuals in which there is grossness: caps and form a coil and similar to theirs, until it is composed.
And if you find putrid flesh in the cartilage and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that rottenness and remove it, and apply careful cure to it.
Most surely if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which flows potent blood that can come out, and it is not abscessed by medicines, then you inquire about the artery, and if you find that one unincised, then you incise that with a spatula, or lance it; and if necessary to provoke what we have said does not congregate, then you cauterize until the blood is abscessed.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then the cause of theirs is lighter; thus you dust over those with that powder, because consolidated there beneath so that the air does not change them.
And the manner of the powder is this: take oil of iris one part, dragon's blood two parts, and cinnamon three parts not extinct; let it be all well trituated and crushed, and of that let the wound be filled, and let it be constricted by good constriction until it be above the aching, and let it be coagulated with the blood.
And then strengthen that beneath with poults and lift it, and do not remove it while it is thus that it is not applied, because it is not eradicated from there by the medicine until it is healed.
And some old woman makes that solo remedy, when it is not to you in presence of iris and dragon's blood.
And already this method of operation is suitable for large wounds when it is convenient to pause over them and they are straight, and these recent wounds are with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is in summer time, then it is not intended for the position of this powder, most surely cure those with what we have said, thus you pause over those swollen gums digested, or you pause over those pustules of flour of the ordinary water and honey until they get purification; and apply careful cure to those with another careful cure until they are healed.
Most surely if you find a fracture wound in the bone, and it is small, then you extract that with gestures.
And you direct the cure of fractures of the head in what is coming.
Of the wounds of the neck.
Most surely if the wound occurs on the neck, then it is not in its difference from medication, and between the wound of the head when it is simple.
Most surely if the nerve of the neck is incised or artery, then if it is nerve, it is not in its engendering but that careful cure be avoided with what makes vehement stipulation, thus as zinc and zeal that it is veteran and similar to theirs because no others are like those nerves and contradict that. And do not pause over the wound for any total cause of all freshness, because the substance of the nerves is fresh and their continuation is with the brain, which is the pus that comes from all the members.
And if it is that which is cured by light medicines, thus as it is caused by washing with warm water, some veiled infusion in oil of roses or non-roses, and thucia when it is washed with warm water and the other small pains are minimized according to this manner, and swollen gums are humbled.
Most surely if the wound is large, then administer suture, or sew up the lips of it, and apply careful cure to that with poults until it is healed.
Most surely if the wound is deep or occurs in the place of putrid matter, then pierce that at the most depressed location.
Most surely if in the wound an artery is incised and a flow of blood is obtained, then separate or dry that, or lance it, or cauterize it if necessary to provoke what we have said.
Most surely if you have incised the vertebrae of the neck or all, and so saved the veins of the neck, then you adjust the lips of the cartilage with a suture over the cane of the neck and do not touch that; afterwards equalize that and reduce it to its natural figure, and apply careful strengthening to that with decent structure, and lift that for several days; and apply careful cure to that with swollen gums in which there is stipulation and excitement until it is healed.
If the plague has already entered the patient's bone to make an impression, then perceive it, and if there is a fragment of bone, extract all that you can from them; and what you do not apprehend, let it remain within so that the plague does not spread, and separate and remove the affected part from the healthy one.
And if the plague is recent, then powder over it with the powder that you have recommended. If the plague has made a fistula, then cure it with what is remembered to bring remedy soon to the sick head.
If it is a percussion of the ribcage or of the lance, and sometimes of its depth, then consider that if the plague has taken possession of the patient's body, then you know that the plague is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the plague is recent in the sick blood, then you pause in it from the first hour powder, and do not strenuous that which is not the retained blood in the depth of it and returns to the heart and revives the patient, rather pause in it an attractive engagement, and deliver those two weighed doses a day.
And if the engagement is not present to you, then pause at the orifice of the plague, which collects much from the humidity; and make that the patient sleeps on the plague so that it may run what is in it, adjusted.
If the plague has passed three days or more and does not affect the patient with spasm or tremor of bad heart nor constriction of wings, and sometimes the other good dispositions of it, then you know that the plague is saved; and then cure it with warm compresses and another curative treatment until it is healed.
If the healing of it is exhausted, and already all time is opened, then you know that a fistula has been made; cure it therefore for the sick head.
And if the plague is by incision of scapula or of ribcage, and is simple on the surface of the foot or of the back, then cure it with what is preceded by suture, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
If it has made an impression on the bone, and its roots are implanted, then you twist the plague and cut to extract those roots, if they are separated. If they are not separated, then let them remain within so that the plague does not spread, for the extraction of them is alleviated.
And of the other plagues occurring in the other members, the juvenation in cure is the juvenation of what we have said.
Of the plagues of the belly.
The indisposition that affects the belly is either great, or small, or middling.
And small disruption is made difficult by another manner, and thus it is that the reduction of them is more difficult, if you do not take care of their introjection at the right place immediately, because it becomes thickened and is grossly engrossed, for which the instrument of it is made difficult.
And thus the better disruption is middling, because in that it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is difficult in the two species mentioned above.
And you know that the suture of the belly is according to four manners, but two sutures are common that are convenient for sutures of the other plagues of the body.
And two other proper sutures communicate with the other plagues, but especially so many are proper in the suture of the belly.
And I recommend to you each exposition and declaration.
So I say that when the plague is small and it has some cause in the intestine for that, and it is made difficult to reduce it, then it is in one of two manners: either by smallness of the disruption as we have said, or when the intestine is come to inflammation from the coldness of the air.
And so when it is thus, then you should scald that in this way that you submerge a sponge hot and dripping with humid water alone, or that you cook in water squinant, and cyperum, and spic, and embroques with that in the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
And some taken possession make it visible in which it has stipulated, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And so when you see the inflammation is resolved, then you humidify the intestine with water in which is cooked altaea and malvas, because for that it is alleviated the instrument of it with few causes.
If the instrument of it is excused from this cure, then you separate the disruption with a small instrument in which are implanted emollients.
And the first treatment is better, when it is probable that there is no infection, and there is no occupation to occupy or delay necessary relief.
From the instrument, see its shape in it:
One part of the sharp-edged torcha, and the other not-acute, and the subtle extremity, and it should not be in the subtlety of the spatula, unless it becomes obtuse at a few points.
And then when the plague is amplified and goes outside the intestine, then it's necessary that its reduction be according to the form of the natural location, in its own proper place, if it's possible about that, because better is.
Moreover when the disruption is wide, and it's in the lower part of the belly, then it's necessary that you place the patient on their back, and stop their legs besides their head; and if it's in the upper part of the belly, then you stop their head and the chest besides the parts below.
And similarly if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then pause your attention and consideration at all times so that the part where the plague is may be more open than the other.
And thus it's necessary that you administer this in great plagues and in minor plagues.
And in small plagues, pause that which is at your preparation, and make sure that the minister is between your most prepared hands, which hold the entire disruption in its mouth and adjust its lips, and then discover from that to him who knows the suture of some other cause.
And this is the common method of suture: one that takes the needle, or counts the threads according to the quantity of the amplitude of the plague; and then release the extremity of the disruption from the ring finger, and stretch the thread once, without you putting faith in the two extremities of the codeina, both extremities of the cipher that is below the codeina of the divided parts, until you make it penetrate that part; and you have already added both extremities of the codeina and both extremities of the cipher, and so form four orders.
And then stretch with double faith in the circuit of the needle, and some divided parts together, and then add both lips to the plague for decent addition; and then release the grossness of the finger and fix another needle there, and then tie it with double faith as if it were the first needle; and do not cease from doing that if it is necessary among the needles until you complete all the contraction of the plague.
And thus the minor needles are between roughness and subtlety, because the subtle needles hardly ever incidentally touch the flesh; and the large ones are of difficult entry into the codeina, and therefore it's necessary that they be minor in subtlety and grossness.
And it's not necessary that the needle be fixed in both extremities of the codeina nearby, so that the flesh is not incidentally touched and that the plague does not open before its consolidation.
And there are no prolonged sutures because the plague should not be prohibited from consolidation.
And then insert the extremities of the needles so that they do not let the patient deviate from their proper dormier; and pause over the suture with pulverized expanses of entire parts, which hold the extremities of the needles; and release them until you know that the plague is already consolidated.
And these species of suture with needles in this way are more convenient in small plagues, because they have need of a suture of one needle or two or around those.
Moreover the second suture is communal: and it's that you administer a suture of the four extremities, of the codeina and both extremities of the cipher, in one way, with a needle in which faith is enveloped in subtlety and grossness.
And then when the needle has penetrated these four extremities, return the needle to that same part of which it began, so that the faith retracts from the most sublime part to the plague, so that the suture is according to the suture of a taut thread in which the threads are strongly tightened.
And pause between each suture the quantity of the grossness of the smallest finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And in this suture I cured the plague that had afflicted a man in his belly, which had been plagued by a cut, and it was the disruption of the major plague of one palm, and it was situated around two palms from the intestine of the middle place, and it was the disruption in the middle of the limb; and then I cured it after the intestine had been outside the plague for 23 hours.
And the plague was consolidated in the space of 15 days or around, and I cured it and it was healed; and then I visited for many years, and it was converted into its proper dispositions.
And the other doctors have judged that it is not a healthy place; and by miraculous focal point, because you do not cure anything that has been wounded, because it was in a place where the wound was not treated or any medicine, but rather the plague was hidden for many days, and continually ablution with warm water inside, so that it may be healthy.
Perhaps you direct two special types of proper suturing according to the narration of Pareula.
And it is that you begin with suturing of the cord, and you insert a needle from the front part to the back part.
And thus when the needle penetrates into the cord and in that moment it goes straight according to rectitude and in the length of the whole body, and it reaches the extremity of the ciphac where you have inserted the needle; and make it penetrate from one extremity to the other, from the back part to the front part, in the other extremity of the miyat.
And then when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate another way in that same extremity of the miyat from the front part to the back part; and it reaches the extremity of the ciphac which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate from one extremity to the other, from the back part to the front part.
And make it penetrate again in that same penetration, which you do by penetrating into the ciphac in the extremity of the mirror, which is inside, so that all of it penetrates.
And then begin from this same side and sew up that extremity which is of the ciphac on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the cord that penetrated, and then return it to its place in the cord, and so the extremity of the ciphac which is on the other side is in this same extremity of the mirror; and withdraw it from the cord which belongs to it.
And make one way and another, and make one way returning to another way until you collect all that is before, according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suturing is that you collect a suturing of pellicles in which you collect the skin, and thus you collect the ciphac one way from the part of the extremity of the cord, and that you leave another way until it is complete.
Perhaps the second special type of proper suturing that Gualia recommends, and this is concerning the serum of it and for its recommendation, it is that you collect according to similarity in which some doctors collect it, and thus they add all part to its corresponding part convenient by nature; and they apply the extremity of another to the mirror's extremity to the other extremity, and that is done according to what you have recommended.
That you fix the needle in the extremity of the mirror at your own part from the front, and make it penetrate to the back part in that sole, and leave two extremities of the ciphac; and then return the needle and make it penetrate from the front to the back in two extremities of the ciphac.
And then return those circles, and make penetrate certain ones from the back part to the front part in two extremities of the mirror other than those that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suturing is better than the common ligature, and it is a suturing of which I previously mentioned remembering.
This is the serum of Gualia.
And perhaps the doctors said that a suturing of the belly is rectified with two needles, so it is that you insert in these a certain fidelity, and begin with an introduction of needle from what is yours, and make it penetrate into the other side according to the suturing of those who sew up the intestines together.
And you know that when disruption is in a middle location of the belly, then the suturing of it is more difficult than in other locations of the belly.
Perhaps the judgment of medical treatment of plague is a judgment of the other plagues.
Which cause is because when you consider the recent plague similar to the holy blood that it alters, and reduces the intestine and collects it and adapts it decently, then pause over that incarnative powder.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then pause over those doctors who are present until they make a hard and strong remedy, and consolidate ciphac and mirror; and then cure it thus as is the cure of the other plagues until it is healthy.
Perhaps if you are not present with the medicines, then pause over that so much, because it begins to take a long time, and ablute many times a day, thus as you and teach, until it is healthy, because you do not need other medical treatment in many dispositional motives when the plagues are simple.
Perhaps if you fear that the plague communicates with the principal members, then it is necessary that you submerge the woolen thread in oil of tempered quality, or in rose oil, and pause it in the circuit of the places that are between the angles and leave the essences.
If there is pain or putrefaction in the intestines, because many empty veins have ended there, then crystallize that bitter medicine with a sharp pointed instrument, and it will be more effective if the perforation is made in the intestine and it makes an penetrating exit into its cavity.
You know that the one that is of the large intestine is to remove more easily than the one that is in the subtle intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine which is called "gizzard" does not receive healing of a wound that falls into it from everywhere; and this is due to the great multitude of veins that are in it, and due to its magnitude, and due to the subtlety of its body, and due to its proximity to the nature of nerves.
Perhaps what proceeds from the wound is the fabric, and you will achieve that remedy, reduce it according to your correct method in which you reduce the intestines in a gathered way.
Perhaps it has passed to the space and already becomes green or black, then when you stretch out that faithful hand over the area that is denied of it, in order to bring forth flows of blood, because in the fabric there are veins and arteries.
And then you will find another ligament, and place two extremities of the faithful hand pending on the part below the wound, so that above you may be alleviated the attraction of it from the fixation of the fabric and emission of the arm from the wound.
Remembrance of the wounds when they occur in the intestine.
When disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some homes, because thus you saw that which was wounded in the hollow belly with percussion of a lance and it was the wound of the right part of the stomach, and the wound was ancient and made a fistula, and thus of its management and ventilation.
Then you will observe the cure of it, because it was not confused in its healing, perhaps it continues to make subtle that which is focused on sanitizing and the area is consolidated.
And you will see that the area is consolidated, then place it on the patient who has suffered an evil accident in the hollow belly; and do not suffer any more for that evil accident and remain in their many virtuous and beneficial habits, and then enter into a bath and it is exercised in its daily routines.
And I will describe certain experimented remedies that when an injury occurs in the intestine, and it is small, then it is necessary to bind it according to this manner: and it is that you take fragments of large caps; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and place a fragment of those that have the open mouth over the two lips of the wound; thus when you take hold of them and stretch their mouth, you will remove the cap of it, because they adhere and do not dissolve.
And then place another fragment next to the first one, and do not cease from making fragments until you have made all of them according to the quantity of the entire wound.
And then reduce that and close the wound; and remain with those attached caps in the intestine until the intestine is sanitized; and do not harm the patient with any further annoyance.
And it is possible that the intestine is subtly tied with faithful thread which is made from the intestine of a beast annexed to it, because it is mixed in a needle; and it is that you take the extremity of these threads of intestine, and it is not very descarnated, and then tie the extremity of it to the thread of the intestine, enveloping, and then insert that thread into needles and close it around the intestine, and reduce it in the disruption.
And this manner of suture with fragments is not anything but according to the way of trust and hope.
Perhaps the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the subtle intestines, because then it is not anything but subtlety, and there is no healing of it at all.
Of the cure of ulcers and fistulas.
You know that every wound and aposteme when they become evil and ancient, it is made an ulcer, and it is not consolidated and gets worse over time and does not heal, then, in whatever member it may be, universally it is called fistula and we call it that azukem.
And fistula, according to truth, is a nodulation of a feutrada, hard, white matter which does not cause pain and which is conquered thus as it is conquered by the penalty of ausel; and for this reason it is called a certain rizatz, that is penalty.
And it is in some humid homes, which gets worse; and for this humidity is removed at certain hours. And some evacuated this humidity are many, and it is few, and it is thick, and it is subtle.
And I have shown you all those causes, and the signs of those and the cure of their loves in medicine in division.
And I will teach you how to know the cure of fistula, which is done by way of operation in hand.
And you know that fistula occurs in all the members of the body; because some of them are fistulas that penetrate to the large veins and arteries, or to the nerves, or to the diaphragm, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to some of the composite joints composed of the hand and foot; and of these it is said to give proximity to the principal member and similarity.
And therefore those of these fistulas that are according to this manner are among the difficult-to-heal diseases, and do not receive cure, and occupation with them is trouble and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas at a depth that does not allow to reach those places that I said, and you hope and trust in its cure, and want to come to knowledge of it, then take hold with iron or with fire, and if the fistula goes straight, and you acquire it in hand.
But if the fistula is twisted, then investigate it with a subtle lead probe, because lead follows the levity of the sick body and is alleviated and curved away from the twist.
And if the fistula has very horrible motions, it is not possible for you to signify on it with your hand.
Then crystallize the horrific orifice for its horrific orifices, because the humidity through which you crystallize it goes away from the other horrific orifices and corrects their course.
And inquire exquisitely, according to which manner it is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and it is the conquest of the long or proximate fistula, or it is a fistula with many horrific orifices and this is above all your strength, in your introspection, in which you introspect the patient, and the invention of the pain goes away from your compression on the hand, and similarly to the significations and accidental causes of the abscess.
And since you have stated above all those causes in a true station, then go to the cure with confidence: and it is that you consider then if it is an apparent fistula near or in a salty place, distant from a joint, or of nerves, or of arteries, or of veins, or of one of the places which you have said.
Then you dissect the fistula according to what has been said about its narration, and remove that which is in that filtration and of corrupt flesh, and that which is born in the orifice of the flesh, or of the will and similarly, and cure it entirely so that it may be healed.
But if the fistula is of distant profundity, and it is straight, then you should cut that into the preceding part as much as possible, and entirely remove all its corrupt flesh; and then administer wrapped medicines acutely, and introduce them into the conquest of the fistula, which has been grasped with iron.
And do that until some of the veins are inserted so that the acute medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the conquest of the fistula from corruption.
And then restore it with juices that engender healthy flesh until it may be healed.
But if it is not healed by that, then you should cauterize it according to what we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and it is verified by you, then you should inquire into it and dissect it according to what we have recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or principal member, as we have said.
But if the bone is discovered by you and it is in some corruption and decay, then you should root out that entirely so that the corruption may be stopped totally; and then cure it with something that will encarnate it so that it may be sanctified.
And if it is not healthy and gives pain thus as it was doing, then you know that you have not achieved the total eradication of the corruption; and then you should discover above it secondly and exquisitely make the reason of it and the mundification of it with the last strong fortification, and then restore it.
And therefore if it is healthy, good; and if not, then you know that the corruption is in the distant profundity of the body, which has not been achieved, and then you should not engender anything but leave it alone.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to extract it, then you should extract it with subtle forceps that are convenient for that.
And if there are many bones, then you should exquisitely make the extraction of all those, and of those do not leave any cause in your strength.
But if you have made opposition to any cause of the humidities, and in their incision there is no fear or error, then you should dissect those ligaments or flesh if they are here, and extract the bones.
But if you have not prepared to remove the bones from your hour, then pause over the plague that you will purge the plague there, and let it enter so that it is around those bones of flesh and ligaments, and guard against the plague being consolidated, and constrict the section that you have incised in your operation.
Having doubts, pause over the submerged bone above the olive oil, or the submerged bone in Egyptian anguents, or in the alcove of the green vertebrae, because when you will purify those ligaments, and the bones are separated from their ablation, and those attractions are alleviated.
But if it is a large bone thus with the bone of the chamber or thigh or similar to those, and that which is corrupted is the face of it as much as possible, then cut out that badness so that it is separated from the black corruption, and then restore the plague.
But if that which is corrupted is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is a necessary cause to close that and to incise all the way into the place where the corruption has penetrated, and then cure it so that it is consolidated.
And I recommend to you that you endeavor to put someone at their thigh so that they pause there and assist and support your operation.
I have seen a young man of about thirty years, to whom pain occurred in his thigh, and from the affected parts a bad matter is spread throughout the body until the matter reaches the thigh, and it is a matter of great abscess, and I do not find an external cause for it.
And then I found that the time was extended for the error of the doctors until the abscess was hidden, and I corrected the putrid matter, and its cure was paused until the thigh was fistulated, and the joints were in the morbid orifices which all received purulence and the humidities of the body.
And then many doctors were consulted for about two years, and I did not find any of them who knew the art, until I was called.
And I saw the thigh of that man and the matters that were corrupting it from those orifices for a great body; and already the body of that man was completely stabilized and the color of it was citrine.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and penetrated the probe to the bone.
And then I probed and examined all the orifices and thoroughly searched for those penetrating to their depth in all parts of the thigh.
And then I cut and incised over one of those orifices until I discovered a part of the bone, and I extracted that corrupted thing, and it was already decayed and corrupted and denigrated; and it was already corrupted a part of the thigh until it had penetrated into the marrow.
And then I cleared away what was discovered by me and prepared the uncovered bone.
And I judged that it was not in the bone itself but that corruption which I had abscessed and cleared away, and I had already demolished.
And then I paused the restoration of the plague with medicine that consolidates for a long time, and it was not consolidated.
And then I iterated and discovered again on the bone secondarily on the primary discovery, and I continued to find corruption in the bone.
And I cleared away what appeared to me as that corruption, and then I was forced to do the cure of it and restoration, but it was not restored.
And then I discovered about the other vein and did not cease to incise the small bone little by little particularly and performed the restoration of it, but it was not restored until I incised around a palm of it, and that extracted marrow from it, and then I restored it with medicines, and it was consolidated gradually and healed.
And it is not necessary to iterate in the operation of it and its section except for the disposition of its fragility and for the scarcity of its tolerance and fear of its death, because it accelerates at all hours for superfluity of evacuation syncopes badly.
And thus it is healthy through entire healing, and nothing is in place of hard carnal flesh; and the disposition of it was good in its sieve-like body and returned its virtue to it; and it was converted into its dispositions and did not make it contrary in ambulation nor did harm in any cause.
But if it is an eminent bone in place of the body already weakened, then you should take that second joint according to this method: and it is that you take a ligament and strengthen it at the extremity of that eminent bone, and command it to extend itself in its own; and pause that ligament of wool which is thicker than the primary ligament; and then you place it above the flesh that is beneath the bone, and extend the extremity of it so that it attracts the flesh to the parts beneath, and you discover the flesh over the place where you want to saw, so that the saw does not lead the flesh.
And pause or stop the table from touching the patient's body decently, because when you do this it is not prohibited to avoid the corrupted flesh that decays.
And cover the small corrupted area little by little, because if it is in the cavity of the corrupted bone and does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and strengthen the closure of the other side.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, although it is one continued part in the other, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part of it, then you discover the entire flesh of all parts; and then stop the table from underneath, and then cover that of the first part where the corruption enters until the closure of the other part is continued.
And make the closure according to the location of the corruption a little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupted joint, and cover the bone where it continues from the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in its reason but rather in the vein.
And if the corruption is in the chest or foot, it is very difficult; however, cover so that you inquire into the corruption in whatever manner it appears to you, and that you open it, and remove it according to each disposition which is possible for you, and also with caution lest it be rectified to you, when it does not make you contrary veins or nerves.
And know what the incisions and closures are to incise these bones, according to the situation of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety and greatness and smallness, and their hardness and rarity; so that you prepare for all kinds of operations and convenient instruments for that operation.
And know that this operation depends on you regarding the type of instrument which you need; when you are great study and long and knowledgeable about the ways of this art, and testimony of ways of illnesses, because then you have them for your measures that are convenient to all instruments for all illnesses.
And you will find in the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will pause with, as I have simplified them, and those that proceed to your prohibition, which you will experiment on the others. Form of closure:
Form of another closure: (no change, same translation)
Form of a large closure:
Form of a radius: Be the head of this radius according to the form of the head of a star-shaped claw, and the points of it are according to the form of the points of a steadfast instrument.
And it is not suitable unless you have that instrument confected with the heads of the joints when they are corrupted, or it is a large wide mouth.
Form of a smaller razor:
Form of a broad razor:
Form of another closure made decently: it is made with an arched curve of the foot above and the acuity of iron, and the member of the foot below is made decently. Form of it:
Form of a razor in which it has been concaved:
Form of another subtle razor:
Form of another razor with a curved extremity:
Form of a small razor resembling a lancet:
Form of another smaller incisor:
Form of another incisor; this resembles a radius, and the extremity of it is like a closure, and it is exhibited in many places in the ratio of the bones:
Form of a radius which is suitable for a ratio of that which is perforated through the bones:
And its extremity is triangular and of sharp point.
And it is made of iron from India, and similarly you cover all the causes that we have said about razors and incisors and closures.
Of incision extremities and of the closure of the bones.
The extremities are weakened either by an intrinsic cause or by an extrinsic cause, or as you have medicated that corruption with a cure of those medicines and the cure does not concur, or sometimes the corruption becomes so bad that it deviates from the member which is not perceived by any cause, then it covers that you incise that member until it reaches the corrupted area, so that the evil may evacuate through death or malice which is greater defilement of the member.
And the sign of that one to which it happens, is that the member becomes black until it is understood that fire has already consumed it, or it withers away near the blackness until the withering reaches that member and takes all the body; and thus you will know the incision of that one.
And similarly if it is a cause of corruption from venomous causes, such as the sting of a scorpion or of a viper or of a rattlesnake and of similar things.
If the corruption or percussion is in the extremity of the finger, then you should incise the finger and do not leave space for the corruption to spread to the hand.
Similarly, if it reaches the hand, then you should incise that at the root of the forearm, and do not leave space for the corruption to spread so that it takes hold in the forearm.
And if you want to evacuate it, then incise the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and surrounds the elbow, then in that case it is the death of the patient; and to administer another cause for cure is a quantity of virtue.
Similarly, it happens to the foot when corruption reaches the toe of the foot, then you should incise that up to one of the nails.
And if it takes hold on the edge of the foot, then you should incise the entire foot. But if it reaches into the ankle, then you should incise the leg up to the joint of the ankle.
And if the corruption has already spread over the ankle, then in that case it is not a cure but rather a dismissal, and leaving the patient to death.
And the method of incising the limb or of sawing it is that you stretch a ligament in the part below where you want to incise, and stretch another ligament over the area; and extend the minister a ligament to the parts below, and extend the minister another ligament upwards; and you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments in this way until all the flesh is discovered; and then it is incised or sawed.
And take care that it is placed far from the edge of all parts so that it does not touch the area, and that the patient's lesion is adjusted and aposteme is cautious.
But if there is a flow of blood when operating, then you should cauterize the area carefully, or stop the bleeding with some powders that restrain the blood; and then return to your medication until it is completed.
And then bind the wounded limb with a ligament at a convenient point, and care for it until it is healed.
And I recommend to you that which happens to a man in his sick foot, this kind of accident which you and I have recommended, which is because the black humour in the sick foot was assembled with combustion of fire.
And that corruption happens primarily in the sick toe until it reaches the entire foot.
And then that man prepares himself for such pus that he wants to cure the limb with the vehemence of that which removes pain and discomfort, and incises that foot up to the joint, and fire heals.
A long time ago, that same corruption happened in the finger of my hand.
And then it came to me, and I had to perform a repetition of that superfetation on the hand of my medicines, then the mundification of the body; and it does not repeat the superfetation and begins to move to the other finger until it reaches the hand.
And they asked me to incise the hand of that, and I did not want to do anything expecting a repetition of that superfetation, and perhaps it would have been better to have avoided the incision of the hand of death, because the virtue of the patient was on the point of collapse.
And since he despaired of me, he returned to his land and it happened to me that that man prepared and incised his entire hand, and was healed.
And I have not added this narration except to be an aid regarding what is said about this disease, and that it may be significant for which it is signified and according to which it is operated.
Of the care of joints and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in certain carnal members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus, and then it breaks and perforates, and the pus flows out, and the area around which it was like a vessel, and the channel that is above it like a subtle drain, and it does not reach the underlying corruption, and it does not impinge on the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and it is not named fistula.
But perhaps if the space is prolonged until the corruption penetrates into certain members, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the cure of it is that you incise the entire channel in this way as it is revolved, and mainly when it is subtily drained and made to flow like a drain, and confirms that it does not adhere to the area because of its corruption.
But if you think that the channel adheres and that corruption has not been achieved by underlying consequence, and in the channel there has been a passage of carrion, then you should cure it with a cleansing.
And it is that I consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the arm which you have of fetid odor, then cleanse it with Egyptian medicine which is of oil and vinegar and zinc, receiving equal parts, and adjust them in a vessel, and apply them over the fire until the medicine becomes red and reaches the specific of honey.
And you take the water that is necessary and dissolve it in a warm liquid and honey; and cleanse the sinus, and strengthen the orifice of the intestine, and leave the medicine in it for two hours.
Then extract that liquid with precision; and make it for several days until the sinus is purified and the putridity is removed.
And some vegetables are cleansed with warm water of cinder, when you do not have this medication present; and it is that you take the cinder of vitriol, and put it over the water; and then take that and cleanse it in her until you confirm that the sinus is cleared at that time.
And if the patient has no tolerance to the Egyptian medication or the water of cinder, then cleanse it with warm water and honey mixed with ziniar trissat, and cleanse it with warm water and honey mixed, because the property of honey is that it purifies and cleans, and the warm water makes the sinus adhere, and it increases when the warm water has overflowed with moisture and dryness.
And when you make that liquid with some vegetables and you confirm that the sinus is already cleared, then cleanse it with water that makes the flesh of the body soft.
And it is that you take the juice of dyafinicon and dissolve it in oil of rozat and warm stipptic; or that you cleanse with some medicines and other juices that have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on juices.
And if the orifice of the sinus is straitened in which the tube of the syringe is not received, then you amplify that liquid by adding a little ferrum petit at a time, and pause in the wrapped calyx covered with Egyptian juice or basilicon juice until it is amplified.
And similarly if the orifice is wide, then you add the lips of the liquid to the suture and leave the quantity in which the syringe injects its additions.
And if the orifice of the intestine where the arm is elevated to the upper parts, then dry it in the lower place where it is in the body so that the arm may flow until below, because when the arm is constricted at the entrance of the sinus, the flesh will be engendered in the body.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus until the lower place of the bone according to your wishes, then you should prepare the member with preparation so that the arm may flow more easily according to what is apparent to you and so that no cause of the arm is retained.
That which is over the orifice of the sinus, which remains there for a whole hour so that it flows correctly into the arm. And so you know if the liquid that flows from the arm is a lot or a little, whether it is digested or not digested.
And then you consider the place of that sinus, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is in an abscess.
And when your medication is prolonged in such a manner, and you see the matter that is poured over the orifice of the sinus already adheres, or takes proper adhesion, then you may detach it on the third day, and when you detach the plague, then change the cloth for another and renew the juice.
But if the sinus has a subtle and fine virus, then do not despair of its adhesion, because the health of the body is proper, because some homes are in those which slow down the generation of flesh in the aforementioned plagues, and of those which are made contrary to it.
And if the sinus for many days has an indigested arm, then you know that the sinus does not adhere; and if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and is a prolonged cause, then you adjust in the desiccation of the medicines, and if the medicines are humid in their substance and in their virtue, they are dried also like juice of dyafinicon, when it is in an adjusted superfluous addition of zegi.
And the last medicine which is curative, is that you take juice of dyafinicon and dissolve it in oil of rozat, and put it on the arm with an antique vessel in its substance, and then confirm that liquid, and use it.
And thus it is similar in that action, when there is no arm, juice of dyafinicon, honey which is cooked until it is thickened, and use it; or take mirra and aloen and grind them, and sprinkle all over the honey which is under the focus, and then spread that liquid over the cloth and strengthen it over the sinus; and thus spread that liquid over the honey which has been cooked until it is thickened, and sprinkle over the cloth and strengthen it.
And certain evacuations are administered in the long Aristological method and celestial roots (and it is celestial roots) and farina of errors and centaurea, and use of those simple or adjusted, trituration and pulverization on the honey that has been recommended; and its juice.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and it is not healed by this cure, then you know that the corruption is in the praecordium of the patient, and already there is an inquiry into the bones or other hard members or ligaments; then you will treat with a fistular cure, as it is said below.
Of the treatment of painful and worn-out nails and of incised fingers added to the section.
Painful nails are an aposteme which often arises from the nail of the hand or foot, and it often occurs in other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its treatment is less attended to, or it becomes apostematous from the post-aposteme caution, or it becomes corrupted, and it throws a branch within that corrodes the root of the nail, and it corrupts all of it, and it perverts its corruption to the bone within, so that it is at the fetid odor, and the extremity of the finger is affected, and the color of it is darkened.
And then when you have that water which we have spoken of in the division and it does not conduce to your cure, then it is necessary that you remove all the superfluousness that has grown from the nail and return to cauterize the wound with that water, because a cautery made in this way is very beneficial.
Moreover if the bone is healthy and the nail is sound, and the additions of the nail are already comprehending the flesh in the divided parts, and they begin to sting and pierce that, then it is necessary that you pause subtly under the angle of the nail that pierces the flesh, and you press upon it and incise that flesh to facilitate, and you put on what remains of the flesh of the corrosive medicines burning within so that it may be totally removed; and you return to cure that wounded area until it is healed.
Moreover if the corruption has already taken hold in the bone, then it is necessary that you incise the bone itself and extract it, for no time will it be healed while it is in the corrupted bone.
And if the corrosion and corruption are in the finger, then you incise it in one of the nodes according to the premise of its reminiscence, and you return to cure it until it is healed.
Moreover if the nail has received percussion or attrition, and has become painful with vehement pain, then it is necessary that you begin to soften the patient, and return to cut the nail with a spatula-like instrument with a transverse section above the joint, and beware that the section does not penetrate into the flesh which is under the nail, lest you cause the patient vehement pain, and it will be the cause of the superfluous nativity of the adjusted flesh in the location; and return to treat that location with water that alleviates the pain.
Moreover, it is adjusted, which is born in the marrow of some men, for they are entirely fleshy, and entirely in their bones, or entirely in their nails.
And some of them are born in the root of the joint, or it is the nativity of them in certain nodes of the fingers. Moreover, that which is born in certain nodes of the finger does not become evil, and that which is born in the joints is entirely bad.
And of those that are fleshy growths, the section is easier, and it is necessary that you incise that with a broad spatula-like instrument.
Moreover, of that which is born in the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of its abscession.
Moreover, in that which is born on the fingers with nodes, it is necessary that you incise at the beginning the flesh of it with a round incision into the bone, and return to close with one of those convenient serrations adapted to that, and return to cure it until it is healed.
Moreover, consolidation occurs which adheres to the fingers among the evacuated joints or by nativity of the man who is thus, or by consolidation of the wound or by combustion of fire, or by semblance, therefore it is necessary that you section that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And return to pause between the drapes of the inflamed joints with rose oil so that they are not consolidated too quickly, and separate them among themselves, or pause among them a thin layer of lead until it is consolidated according to what is necessary.
And similarly if consolidation occurs in certain fingers at the palm, then you section that consolidation according to how it is prepared and adapts to the figure of the limb.
Of incision of veins, they are variable.
Veins are variable, and they are enveloped by gross superfluous melancholic fluids which come from the members of the body, and the greatest advent occurs in their hollows, and they are augmented in the hollows of the wanderers and laborers and carriers.
Then you should administer purging of the body from black bile by evacuating strongly, and also bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
The treatment of their iron instruments is according to two methods: one is that they should be inserted and the black blood should be attracted, and the other method is that the vein should be raised and all the blood should be extracted.
The sectioning of it is according to this method: start by introducing the leg in hot water so that the thick blood is resolved, which is foul-smelling from the leg, and then stretch the leg of the patient towards the upper part of the thigh into a band, and then section the vein in one place, or two, or three with ample sectioning, and then raise the black blood to the highest part of the thigh above the knee, and from there down, until the quantity of blood that you want is evacuated, and which will tolerate the virtue of the patient.
And then leave it there, and command him to abstain from food that generates black bile.
And continue the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and it is noticed to be beneficial to the patient.
The elevation of them is according to this method: you raise the patient's leg, if there are many pimples on it, and then place it in a bath and introduce the leg into hot water until it becomes red and the veins become exuberant; or it should be exercised with strong exercise, if a bath is not present at your location, until the member becomes warm.
And then section the cord at the right of the vein for sectioning in the groin or in the back of the patient's knee, or at the lowest part of the patient's ankle.
And then uncover the cord with an incision and excavate the vein from all parts until it appears to the sense, and it is necessary for the patient's appearance, which sometimes declines into blackness.
And then, when you evacuate from the cord, you will see that white thing which is a vein.
And then place it below the vein until it is elevated and removed from the cord, and suspend it in an incision or open wound.
And then section another section in that section for three fingers, and then excavate the cord from the part below the vein until it appears.
And then raise it and insert it into the back section of the ankle, and then extract it and raise it until it is evacuated through the second section, and then extract it from the section that is above it.
And do it until you extract it from the section that is above or outside of all the sections, until everything is evacuated; and then insert it.
And if you cannot extract and elevate it, then introduce a strong double-edged needle and tie it up and extract it, or introduce it below the vein and rotate your hand to all parts until it is grasped. And be careful that it is not inserted; because if it is broken, it will be difficult for you to elevate it much and it will come back over the patient through that injury.
And when everything is evacuated, then pause over the place of the wounded area submerged in wine and oil rose and oil not-rose, and cure it until it is healed.
And if the life is contrary and has twisted around which it is enveloped in the parts, and it is not according to rectitude as we have said, then you should confess about that to the whole part of twisting of it and the places of its envelopment, and then suspend it in an incision until it elevates everything.
And be careful with your sectioning that you do not insert the vein and that you do not harm it, because it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and preserve your prudence in that.
Method of inserting into the place where life is sectioned:
It is not to be inserted hastily like that into the incision or wound, nor is it of acute extremity so that it does not harm the vein; and it is of gross flexibility, because if it were subtle, it would insert the vein by its subtlety; having excess in superfluous grossness like that which we have said.
On the extraction of the veins of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs on hot lands, just like in the land of Arabs and in the hot and dry lands of India with little fertility, where there are no herbs or plants.
And it is generated strongly in other places of the body besides the legs.
And the condition of it is of putrefaction that you see below the cord, just like venomous snakes and worms and scorpions and worms generating between the cord and the flesh.
And the sign of the suspicion of the advent of it is of this vein that causes inflammation vehemently in the leg; and then the place becomes blistered; and then the vein starts to issue from the place of that blistering, which seems to be rooted like a plant.
And then it appears from there to the extremity, then cover it with a piece of lead weighing one dram, or two drams, and place that suspended from the leg.
And many times, with the eyes of the alcuna cause in the foreparts, wrap it in lead and apply that. And if the motion is prolonged, then you insert a part of it and wrap the remaining; and do not insert that with too much force until it is fully settled, because if you insert it with force, it becomes counterproductive and enters into the flesh, causing apostema and putridity in the area and ulceration badly.
Because it is necessary that it be treated gently and be extracted little by little, until it is fully removed from the back of it and no remaining cause stays in the body.
And from this vein it is extracted in some men who are in their longitude of 5 palms and of toes, and already I have received one of 20 palms.
And if it is inserted at the time of its medication, then introduce the ray into the channel of it and perforate that long channel in the body, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and administer putrefaction to the area for several days with medications; and then cure it for the cure of apostemas.
And in this vein some times there are many ramps, and it worsens when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and it goes to the most horrific orrificis, and it is extracted from some horrific orrificic ramp.
And thus cure it in this way as we have said in the division and with that which is written above.
About the generation of worms under the skin, and it is called bovine disease.
This disease is named in some land as our bovine disease because many times it comes from the oxen and it is a worm that is born between the skin and the flesh, and it goes throughout the whole body, destroying and corrupting, and it shows its sentiment by disarticulating the skin and eyes from member to member until it dismembers the skin and eyes.
And its generation is through the putrefaction of certain humors, thus causing worms and serpents and lumbrics and ascarids to appear in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, because when it goes into the body and rises to the head, and reaches the brain, then it strongly affects it and destroys the brain, and that is why many times it comes.
And thus when you want to cure it and extract it, then it cannot be done unless you have the ambulation and application of it to the sentiment, and then it is necessary that you strengthen what is above it and what is below it with ligament and constriction, and then you dry above it and extract it.
And if it is embedded in the flesh and does not come out, then you apply cautery with fire on the area until it dies, and the main cause that is feared is corruption of it in the place where it corrupts the area as we have said.
Perhaps it has reached the head because of the brain, then strengthen above the eyebrow with a strong structure, and then dry above it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the bad humor use the mondification of the entire body in medications evacuating putrid bad humors, and guard against the generation of putrefaction.
About the section on nafrid disease.
This disease is named in our land as nafrid, and it is the pain that appears in certain members, and then it spreads from member to member.
And I have already seen that according to what I recommend to you. I was called to a sick woman in a town, and I discovered her swollen arm and saw a small inflammation in the vein of the arm, and after I had been there for an hour, I saw that inflammation go away thus as it went down from this to that, but more lightly than it should be, thus as if it was silver I saw when it corroded from place to place.
And then I placed it in the pain of that place and fixed it in the muscle, and then I stayed there for an hour.
And then I corrected it in the other body until it reached the other arm.
And then I recommended to myself that it revolve throughout the entire body according to what I had seen; and I was very marvelled at the permutation of it and at the velocity of member to member. And I had already seen this before in my own veins according to that manner, however I have seen many of those which cause pain to be permuted from member to member. But I did not see it in the veins thus as in the woman.
And I did not think it was that unless it was because the woman was old, one of dry body and discovered veins, and in this way it appears to the sentiment that permutated ventosity.
It is necessary that you do not appear to be retrograde in those who are delicate and have a humid constitution with weakened veins.
And when you want to cure them, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to you as we have said, then you strengthen over that and leave it for a long time and settle it with a gentle heat, and cauterize the area.
Perhaps you do not always have the same ties to them, then you cure that which is excessive in the body and what expels bad humors, and clean those putrid and filthy ulcers and serpent-like sores.
From the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to species, and according to the places in the body where they occur, because their diversity is that of those with large points, and small ones, and concave, and rough, so they are solid; and of those with three angles, and of those which have tongues; and of those which have astellas (possibly "astellas" means "stars" or "stellate tips").
And of the symptoms of the brain is when you cut into the arrow, and it passes through the bone, and it is situated on the crown of the head, because it causes vehement headache, and scotomia, and vertigo, and rigor in the veins, and inflammation and rigor of the tongue, and spasms and permutation of understanding and vomiting of cholera, and the vein is abscessed and the voice is destroyed, and it is situated on the place of the plague with white humid blisters resembling pustules, and it appears to be affected by the flesh.
And therefore if you appear to have these symptoms, then you abstain from the cure and extraction of the arrow, unless it is not outside.
Perhaps the symptoms of the arrow when it cuts into the heart, so that it is near the left breast, and it seems as if it were fixed in a hard cause, and not a vain cause; and therefore the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and it runs with the black plague, and it is a coldness of the extremities, and sweating freely, and syncopy; and therefore you know that death descends from all these signs.
And the symptoms when the arrow has affected the lung are expectoration of bloody spumous matter from the plague, and the veins that are near the colon become apostematous, and the color of the patient's skin is changed, and they exhale a great deal of spirit, and demand attraction of fresh air.
And if the arrow cuts into the peritoneum which is in the abdomen, and the pain then is near the small ribs, and it makes a great deal of vehement pain and anxiety, and does not move at all the members of the muscles.
And if the arrow cuts into the stomach, then it is likely that you will have a plague of vomiting and some indigestion.
And if the arrow cuts into the abdomen, and it is fixed in it, you will have some ulceration of the plague, or the web, or hernia which is disrupted, and there is no hope in the cure of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow cuts into the bladder, and it is situated before the urine, and it processes some cause in the parts before, and therefore there is pain over the patient, then you know that it is mortal.
Perhaps the other members are also like the face, the neck, and the gullet, and the shoulders and the adjacent ones, and the vertebrae of the back, and the furcula, and the hip, and their likenesses among the members, are saved according to the major dispositions when the arrow does not touch a vein or artery and is not a poisonous arrow.
And I recommend to you that you have seen the essence of these arrows, so that they signify to you about the cure that is suitable for it.
The cause is, because in one case the arrow was cut into the lacrimal duct of the vein of the eye, and I extracted it from the other part, leaving the grayness of the aurelia of the eye, and it is healthy, and does not affect the eye's functioning.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew whose eye was cut into the grayness of his own vein, behind the eyelid, and the arrow was hidden and could not be reached except by a small extremity that adhered to the Jew's fist, and it was a great arrow among the sharp arrows of the Turks, with an iron point on which there were no aureliae.
It is the judge, and do not neglect it in the sight of a bad accident.
He extracted another arrow from a Christian man who had fallen into the gutter, and it was an Arabic arrow, and it was that which he had swallowed; and then you inserted it between two fingers, and it was submerged in the gutter of his body; and then you subtly felt around there, and then you extracted it, and it healed the Christian.
He extracted another arrow from a man whose body had fallen into his own belly, and you thought he would die from it; and therefore, since he passed thirty days without any change in his condition, you inserted your fingers around the arrow and turned it around, and it healed, and do not neglect it due to bad accident.
I saw a man in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound was consolidated over him, and since he had suffered for about seven years, I extracted the arrow from the root of the thigh.
I saw a woman in whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound was consolidated inside her, and it did not change in her condition, and the woman did not have any movement in some of her natural functions.
I saw another man in whom an arrow had fallen into his face and the wound was consolidated, and you removed the arrow, not feeling much pain, and many signs appeared to be like this.
He extracted the arrow from the man, one of the king's princes, which had fallen into his nose and had already declined to the right side a little, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And you were called for the cure of his wound caused by the falling of the arrow within three days.
And then you felt the wound of the arrow very strongly; and then you inquired about it with a subtle touch, and did not feel it; but I felt it at the point below the right ear, and then you suspected that this point was due to the extremity of the arrow.
And I applied a plaster to the place where I had extracted with attractive and digestive powers, trusting in myself that the place would be cleansed so that it appears to me as the place of the arrow, so that it succeeds over it.
And do not neglect the significant place of the accident where the arrow had reached that place; and you continued to apply the plaster over it for many days without any accident; and the wound was consolidated meanwhile, and I removed the bad humor from the excretion of his body within many days until one day I felt the arrow inside his nose and recognized it as my own.
And then you applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it became open, and I touched it with my finger, and felt the extremity of the arrow subtly, which adhered to the skin.
And then you adjusted it in the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until it appeared to me visibly the extremity of the arrow, and I took time for myself about that for the space of four months.
And then since the wound became amplified, and it was possible for me to introduce the forceps into it, and I remained there, and did not obey the judgment, because you did not cease to subtly ingeniate and engineer about that in many ways of art, until one day began on that in many ways of art, pending to take it out with forceps skillfully made, according to what will be seen at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored the wound.
And some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose was not restored, and you restored it and the wound was consolidated, and it healed entirely, and I did not find any fault in it for any reason.
And you recommend to yourself the quality of extracting some arrows because you paused on that rule and significance about what I have not said, since the parts of this art and its definitions are not understood in narration nor do they comprehend it freely.
And the artisans knew how to compare few things about many; and I know what is present about what is absent; and they found a new operation and new instrument of descent from the external causes of the art when they happen.
And therefore you say that arrows are not forgotten in the members where they are fixed, but rather in two ways: either by attraction to the place where they entered; or by contrast with the other part.
And that which is forgotten by the place where it entered, or it is an arrow proceeding from a fleshy place, and it is attracted and forgotten.
And if you do not obey the judgment of the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary that you leave it for some days until the flesh that is around it becomes healthy, and its attraction and exit are alleviated.
And similarly if it is fixed in the bone and does not obey your judgment, then leave it for some days and try to attract it with motion on any day, and then it will be forgotten.
And if you do not obey your own judgment, then beware that you do not perforate the circuit of the sage in that bone of the entire affected part, so that the subtle travel within does not amplify the sage, and then extract it.
Perhaps the sage is accumulated in the area of the body, and it is accumulated from the sentiment, then you inquire into that accumulation, and if you feel it, then attract it with certain instruments which are convenient for its attraction.
And if you do not operate on it due to the constriction of the plague and the length of the pression, and here there is neither bone nor nerve nor vein, then feel upon the plague until it is amplified and it is possible to extract the sage.
And if you have the aurelia which holds it, then you deliver the flesh in which it is fixed from the entire affected part to the very end that you can do; and operate upon that, if you cannot operate on the evasion of the flesh in the fracture of the aurelia and in twisting of those until it obeys.
And when you administer the extraction of the sage in any location where it is, then use a torque of your hand with forceps on all affected parts until it makes it obey; and subtly use a subtle subtlety so that the sage is not torn and it is made difficult for you to attract it and its extraction.
And if you cannot operate on it at your time, then leave it for some days until the parts that are in its circuit can be restored, and then iterate upon it because then it is alleviated. Perhaps you have made a contrary flow of blood, then administer what we have said about cure in the seventh chapter.
And guard your virtue of incision of vein or nerve, or cord, and administer skill in all manner possible for the evasion of the sage; and make it facilitated and tranquilized and delayed and firmified as you have recommended.
And thus you make counter to the sage so that the patient is according to the figure according to which they must remove the encumbrance of the sage from it, because it is perhaps more juvenile. Perhaps if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you according to the figures.
Perhaps the sages that are forgotten by the contrary of another affected part, or which has already proceeded to some part outside, or has made the extrication of the sage by sentiment of the part above the codena propdan and times that eminent; then you section upon that; and it is the section according to the quantity in which they take the forceps; and then attract it, because it is made lighter to the judgment.
Perhaps it is retained in the bone, then twist the lame according to contrarity until the sage takes root in the bone, and amplify its measurements, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for some days, and then iterate upon it until you find what is sought.
And if the foundation of the sage is in that, then implant it in the body.
Perhaps if the foundation is fallen and you want to administer impulse, then introduce and into that, if it is dull, instrument concert with the cavity of the body in the case of the sage and then implant it in the body.
Perhaps if the sage is concave, then implant it in the instrument strongly inserted into that, because the sage is alleviated by that.
And if the sage is intoxicated, then beware that you concave all the flesh in which it is true, if it is possible for you, and then cure it with what is convenient.
And if the sage is located in the feet, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the ribs, and it is near so that you touch it with your hand, and it is possible for you to section upon that, then section upon that and guard yourself from incision of vein or nerve, and extract it, and then heal the plague if it is indigent, and cure it until it is healthy.
Form of forceps which are attracted to the sages:
If the extremities of their body are like a bird's beak which are affected with cold humors when they take hold of the arrow for fear of not releasing it.
And of those are affected special motes, large, few and smaller, according to the quantity of the greatness of the arrow and of its slight weakness, and of the amplitude of the plague, and of its constriction.
thus with a ray so that it alleviates the instrument in it through the concave arrow and it is impelled at that moment.
Of the phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins of phlebotomy of those that customarily run to be phlebotomized thus. of those that are in the head, 16. it is two pulsating veins that are near the ears, they say alhasisain; two herbs that are in the two temples apparent; and two veins that are in the two lacrimal ducts of two eyes that are called aspicientz; and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the extremity of the nose; and two guides that are at the neck; and two veins that are under the upper lip; and two veins that are under the lower lip; and — these are the veins that are called algelic —; and it is two veins that are beneath the tongue. More, the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are thus. because of those, one is a cephalic, and it descends to the wild lettuce; and the people call it "the vein of the head", and it is a cord-like vein, and it is a minor vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilica, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people name that "vein of the whole body", and the basilica is a vein which is placed in the domestic lettuce, and is named "citillar", and the commoners call it "vein of the belly"; and veins of the arm, and it is placed above the focus, and it is that one which is phlebotomized, and it is that one which appears above the thumb for manifest appearance; and salvatella, and it is the vein which is between the auricular finger and the smaller finger, and so in the two branches.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of those is beneath the curvature of the knee of the wild lettuce; and the second is sophena, and its place is beneath the leg of the domestic lettuce; and the sciatic vein, and its place is beneath the leg of the wild lettuce; and in the leg there are other similar veins to those.
The treatment of the veins that are near the ears is for catarrhal, ancient and migrating, and sahafti, and ulcerous evils of the bad old head.
And the quality of bleeding from those is according to what you have recommended to yourself: it is that the head of the patient be shaved, and the head of the patient be rubbed in the occiput at the place of both veins with a soft cloth in good friction; tighten strongly the patient's seat with a bandage inside which appears the two veins and their places near the ears in two prepared places of the head; and if you feel the pulse of those in the third finger, and if you sense the pulse of those in the third finger, here you will have it.
Take the cutting lancet, and it is that which is incident, and take you introduce that beneath the vein in the codeine inside so that the phlebotomy comes out to the bone. And take you raise your hand at the vein and the codeine to the upper parts and inside, and incise the vein in an incident incision. And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two digits adjusted or around that; and make a slight flow of blood as much as you wish.
And take you tighten the poultices and apply them inside so that it be healed.
And now I have preceded in the commencement of the book the incision of those and their cauterization.
More, of the two arterial veins that are in the temples, the treatment of phlebotomy is for ancient and badly behaved migraines and frequent and stubborn ophthalmia and body of acute and overflowing superfluities to the eyes.
And the quality of phlebotomizing those is according to what you have recommended to yourself: constrict the patient's seat with a motive inside so that the two veins appear at the sentiment for manifest appearance and demonstrate the pulse of those beneath the third finger; and then you will have it.
And take you raise the codeine above the vein to the upper parts with the third finger indicating, and introduce the phlebotomy incidentally beneath, and raise the vein in its place; and incise that thus as you have done in the two other veins; and make a flow of blood according to the quantity of your necessity.
And you release the constriction of the patient's hip, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then place it on that joint and poultices and strengthen that constricted part, and thus it will be healed.
Now the memory of the patient's urine is examined, and from that, the diagnosis, and the attraction in the beginning of the book.
And so the juvenation of phlebotomy on the vein of the forehead is close to the phlebotomy of the cephalic one, for ancient evils of the face and to emigrate and to purge and to cleanse fetid ulcers.
And the quality of phlebotomy is according to what you have recommended to yourself; so it is that the patient holds their arm with a bandage, until it appears the vein; and then take the instrument which is called a fleam, whose shape is this.
Stop at the prominent point where the head of the fleam is on that vein and pierce it with a gentle touch or another cause in the manner of the hand, and thus let the healthy blood flow according to the quantity you want; and then release the perforation of the patient and strengthen it until it is healed.
And some veins are opened in the phlebotomy site, however it is not known that the phlebotomy is of acute extremity, thus like the other phlebotomies, except for the lateral extremity, and phlebotomize according to the transverse, because the bone is close and strongly holds the tendon in the phlebotomy site when it is subtle.
The juvenation of the two veins that are like the lachrymal ones of two eyes for scabs on the eyes to purge and cleanse them, and at the evils of the face.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that the patient holds their arm with a bandage, and then phlebotomize them, and you stand still over the head of it.
And it is done the phlebotomy according to the transverse, a little at a time with little phlebotomy, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the phlebotomy is subtle, strongly the extremity of it is torn.
And then let the healthy blood flow as much as you need, and stop on that joint, and strengthen it for one night, and then release it.
The phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is convenient for acute fever and violent sweat, and for the evils of the face and to emigrate and to purge which accumulate in the face, and more so when it is ancient.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that the patient holds their arm and you place your left hand on it, and take the subtle fleam and fix it in the middle place at the head of the nose according to rectitude, because the vein does not appear at all here, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
You know that you ultimately place your hand on the small phlebotomy little by little and let the blood flow according to your need; and then leave it for one night, because it is restored gently.
The juvenation of phlebotomy of the two guides leads to constriction of the wings and beginning of leprosy and many evils and putrid ulcers corroding like herpes.
And the quality of phlebotomy of those is that the patient holds their thighs with a bandage; and the artisan is above the head of the patient, and the patient sits on a chair.
And then phlebotomize the vein at length with little phlebotomy, little by little; and then extract blood according to tempered quantity or according to what is needed at that time; and then make it similar to the other vein.
And then release the bandage and strengthen the two veins with a gentle structure so that the patient is not suffocated, and thus it will be healed by morning because the plague is cured.
And the juvenation of phlebotomy of the Algerich veins, comforts small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and corruption of the gums and evil ulcers and fissures, and evil ulcers that are in the nose and in the circle of it.
And the quality of phlebotomy of those is that you make the patient sit down, and strengthen their arm with a bandage, and then revolve their lips and regard the two veins, one of which is on the right lip and the second on the left; and the demonstration of each is for the blackness of each of both, and that is why in the circle of those small black veins; and then you inject each one for an incidental injection.
Perhaps you have doubt there, and you don't know which one is of those, then you understand the injection of the greatest of those, and of the most manifest pus of those.
And make it similar to the two veins that are in the lips above.
From the two veins that are opened on the tongue, the juice is extracted to perform phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in preference to those in the throat, at the uvula's malady, and at the maladies of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomy on those is that it follows the malady between your hands before the sun, and raises the tongue of it, and examines the tongue, from one side of the vein and from the other side of the vein, and the color of each is declining to black.
And then phlebotomize each one; and beware that you do not ultimately harm your hand in phlebotomizing those, because those are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the hollow of the elbow are those that usually correspond to all the homes, and the phlebotomy of them is done according to two methods, or they put the phlebotomizing mirror or olive wood at a subtlety declining; or they cauterize with a cutting cautery, and apply it to the ankle, and this is their form.
It is the side of the mirror thus many times, and it is suitable for opening the concave full veins appearing gross, and to those that contain much gross turbulent blood.
And this phlebotomy is of lesser latitude and of less subtle extremity, and it is suitable for phlebotomy of subtle veins that contain much subtle clear fluid.
Moreover, the juice of the phlebotomy of the basilica vein, which is one of three veins: because it extracts the blood from the maladies that are below the throat and the colon, and from that which dries the chest and the belly.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomizer, when phlebotomizing that one, to be careful with that and be above-temperament in that, because below there is an artery, and if he errs and adjusts at the point of the phlebotomy, he will incise that artery and cause fluxes of blood, so that it may not happen that they do not phlebotomize with a pungent phlebotomy, unless being sectioned like an ankle.
And if the basilica does not appear by manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you leave that one and that you move to another, or that you seek some other vein; or that you phlebotomize at the end of the arm, because that is manifest; and you will find that with a phlebotomy ankle thus as we have said.
Moreover, if you want the phlebotomy of the metacarpal, then it is necessary to enter into the structure of the arm that you touch the place within which you recognize the place of the pulses, and you will feel about it with your hand; and you will lift the arm and you will see the concave vein in section with a phlebotomy ankle thus as we have said; and beware that you do not hit the percussion for some space of the place of the artery.
And when you do so, with the strength of the ligament, it inflates at the place where you have felt with your hand, then that inflation is an inflation of the artery, and therefore you should avoid that.
And if the blood flows in the phlebotomy thus as the urine of an infant, and the blood is subtle red, then you know that it is from the blood of the artery; and then you touch and pause the aforementioned thing about that for a long space; and you will stop the aforementioned thing, and if the blood is absorbed, because many veins are absorbed, then you strengthen the arm and leave that one.
And beware of the malady of the moisture of it, and be above-temperament about it and do not touch that one for some days until it is healthy.
Moreover, if the blood is not absorbed, and it seems that you do not present medicine for that, then you incise the artery, if it appears to you; because the extremity of it is constricted, and the blood is absorbed; or you take a bandage of fistic, and do that, and take one vein and strengthen it over the place of the vein with strict structure and ligament and pulpils until another day.
And then if the blood is absorbed, it is good; and if not, then you cure that one with water from which it proceeds to the remembrance of the place of the powders absorbing flux of blood.
And the absorption of the blood from it is difficult in many dispositions for the small place of the wound and the possibility of the ligament of the arm.
Moreover, of the dark vein the phlebotomy is juice that extracts the blood from the upper part of the head and from the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, thus as we have said.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomizer to be above-temperament in the phlebotomy of it, because below there is a nerve; and then if he adjusts at the point of the phlebotomy and touches the nerve, it will cause stupor, and it is difficult to heal it, and often it is not healthy at all. And this nerve appears with many veins to the sentiment; and if it is hidden in some homes and is subtle and does not show, then it is necessary that you pause the phlebotomy at which you phlebotomize in section of the ankle, and avoid the nerve at your forcelessness.
If the vein is between two nerves, then you pinch the vein along its length.
The juvenile treatment of the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it attracts the blood from the head and comforts the pains of the heels.
And be careful in this treatment, if you want the phlebotomies to puncture at a phlebotomy olive or at a phlebotomy myrtle; because it is the safest of all the veins, because it is not near an artery or nerve.
Never emperor forces are apostemated in some homes, when it is not phlebotomized on the primary percussion, never touches in that aposteme.
The first of it is that you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except for the conservation of health and for the hope of its improvement and caution against the occurrence of pains, and that it be done phlebotomy in one of the veins that are in the body, such as: cephalic, fusca, and basilica; and that it be done phlebotomy at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtime, when apparent signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy should be done on the third day or at the first hour after three hours have passed since sunrise.
Never phlebotomy that is administered, never when it provokes convenience and necessity at any time, or of night or of day, at all hours and in all circumstances.
And be careful that if the infant is not phlebotomized until they have fourteen years, and a woman who is pregnant should not be phlebotomized except for the fourth month within the seventh, and the old people who have passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
And when someone wants to be phlebotomized for some mania, be careful that you mundify the six veins within the phlebotomy with a clean cluster, if in those there is a retained mucus, so that the veins do not attract superfluities during the phlebotomy of the veins, which are pure, and do not disturb the principal members.
And do not phlebotomize the patients who are nauseous and crippled, nor those who are suffering from pain or from breathlessness until that which is being removed from them is restored, nor those with dropsy, and never that phlebotomy should be tempted near colic passion and near vomiting, and near abdominal pains, and near multiplication of coughs and of troubles and of exercises of fasting or of vigils and of all causes that dissolve virtue, whether it be a corporal28 or animal one.
And also consider in subtlety of humors within that if the blood is gross, with wines and beverages, and with medicines if it is possible to adjust it.
And also enter into bath if some cause does not prohibit it, or be excited by some exercise so that the blood is subtled.
And pause the phlebotomy of it in the foot of the day, so it is around the hour of tierce, thus as we have said.
And perform that the foot of that one be guarded on that day from all evil accidents animals, thus as it is anguish, anger, fear, and all corporeal accidents, thus as it is trouble and excessive pain and coughs and similar to them.
And at its session, make the causes present in the use of that which corrects customarily in the houses with aromaticity and odorament and with balms and similar to them according to the quantity of possibility.
And follow the phlebotomizer on a cushion that is put above the cushion of that one who must be phlebotomized.
And also extract the six arms, and rub that one with their hand the phlebotomizer does two or three times; and also strengthen the ligament in correction and involve those two times.
And be the tempered structure, because the structure when it is not engorged, or the structure is superfluous, then prohibits the flow of blood; or it is mollification, and then prohibits the body of the blood's essence.
And also the structure, be careful that one who must be phlebotomized rubs their hands together between them so that the veins are inflated, and are declared to the sensation.
And also the phlebotomizer anoints the six phlebotomies with a few drops of oil antic properly; and also pause the six fingers of the left hand over that vein, below the place where you want the phlebotomy, so that the vein receives a few drops, and the percussion is seated because one of the veins is the one that attracts thus as a fugent cord wants the phlebotomy, and of those it is full of windiness and when pauses the phlebotomy over that it is contracted thus the phlebotomizer; and the phlebotomy does not open the vein, and if it opens, that is stretched.
Therefore, it is necessary that the flow of blood to the fingers should be stopped and solicited in all these causes.
And then stop the flow of blood, more if a vein is opened in a slight way, then it is good; and if not, you iterate to another spot below that place a little, or above where you are fasting, if the place is not affected.
And if the place is affected, or the patient's disorder worsens, then you leave it alone for a day or two, and do not stretch the limb, because strong stretching can cause an affected joint to deteriorate further, nor does it enter into balance.
And then iterate the bloodletting if it is loved (or desired).
And if the perception is small and you subtly correct the blood, and fear that you do not know the quantity that you want, then you iterate the bloodletting in that tract according to rectitude and adjust it in the perception a little, and do so before the place becomes affected, because the affected place becomes worse in many homes due to little perception.
But if the affected place is already affected, then do not iterate upon it, because it does not excuse you from any cause; and pause on that particular part of the wound of oil, because it alleviates the body's blood. And it is better in this place where oil is and that the other oils.
And similarly, administer the wound of oil in all bloodletting, which bloodlettings prohibit the body's blood from flowing, and make a tyrical and sagzenous remedy when it is paused on one of those above the place, because the blood is subtly evacuated and revolved when it is gross.
And if in the place of bloodletting a great aposteme is generated, because many slight accidents occur, and mainly to one who has not been bled since that time, or in the perception of the little vein, and then you touch, and pause on the place, applying an infusion of hot water and salt, a little scalded, and hold it for an hour, because it is dissolved.
And it is necessary that you do this to stop the flow of blood from that vein, completing it with its own or another vein.
And if you remain in the place for several days with some blackness or viridity, do not notice it; and if you want, pause on that particular cause of aloen and mirra dissolved, or some cause of juice of mintaster or calamint or similar to it.
And many slight accidents occur with apostemes and eminences from bloodletting of the basilica.
And therefore pause your hand over that, and if then you apply a gentle compression over that, then that eminence is evil and bad; and then beware that you pause on that particular cause of what we have said, because strong flow from the artery's blood.
And do you instill it in what is stipulated, so that the place may be indurated, and then heal that wound with another healing process until it is sanctified.
And it is necessary to extract from the blood of every man according to the quantity of his virtue and according to the color that appears on the surface of the blood, as it seems.
Because if the blood is black, then you leave it flowing until it becomes red; and similarly if you find it gross, then you leave it flowing until it becomes subtle; and similarly if it is bitter, until the acuity of it is stopped.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong and has need of blood extraction in a slight way, that the bloodletting of the vein be amplified and the bloodlettings be wide.
And in one who is frail, do the contrary of that, and it is necessary to extract that in many slight ways, and that the tract be straight.
And the better way to administer bloodletting of a vein is that it should be the transverse section, not a puncture.
And this manner of bloodletting is safe from the flow of blood and from injury to nerves, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting according to latitude and longitude.
And at the time when it is customary to come across syncopes from bloodletting, and it is necessary that you cure them beforehand with bloodletting in a small infusion of mild milk or simple oximel scalded; and extract the bad blood in three slight ways or four.
And if it is complicated by completeness, then take beforehand with bloodletting to infuse in a syrup of mirra or in a syrup of mel aromatized with spices thus as with pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar, or in an aromatized and very odorous syrup.
And if accidents occur from bloodletting, and it is the cause of much blood's issuance, then it is necessary to take in drinking water of carnation and a very odorous syrup; and use aromaticity with some algualea, and let the body's foot be limited in that.
And use the other causes that we have said in the division of the chapter on syncopes for evacuation.
And if one wants to evacuate the bad blood and dissolve the second vein, which is at the level of the flea-borne disease, for a rapid evacuation, and its strength is fragile, which evacuates the small blood little by little, it is according to the quantity of the strength in the continuous days.
But if one wants to evacuate the bad arm, and cut the second vein, and the body is strong, then do so at about nine hours or six of the first flea-borne disease.
But if one wants to attract the bad blood of the body from the opposite side of the affected part, it is because it was evacuated on the second day or the third.
But that body in which there is much bad blood already scattered and accumulated and causes fever, because it was cut from the vein in one vein and a large quantity was amplified, so that the perception increases inside until it induces syncope; and you place your hand over the pulse of the vein, so that no mortal danger occurs at the site of syncope, since many veins end there when the flea-borne disease doctor is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not suitable when you want to release the arm and evacuate the second vein, since the orifice of the vein is already closed and it is very difficult to remove the blood, that you press underneath with great violence and the vein is extended at length, because this is too bad.
Having the ladder inside so that it is flea-borne disease secondarily; or remain there with the acute flea-borne disease doctor who is coagulating the blood in the orifice of the vein; or pause on that of tyriacal alfarach, or of sagzenea, and compress underneath with a longer compression so that the blood is forced out.
And if the vein is apostematous, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the apostema is settled.
And if it is necessary to provoke the evacuation of the second blood, and there is no excuse, then prick that spot or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "funnel of the arm" is flea-borne diseased in the place of the fusion or of the basilica, when they are not hardened or shrunken, because it is composed of those.
And the quality of the flea-borne disease is that the patient inserts their hand in hot water until the focus becomes red and the vein appears manifestly.
And then it is strengthened over that limb with a strict Migana structure; and the flea-borne disease doctor operates according to the small transverse, not latitudinally nor according to the longitude.
And it is a broad perception and your flea-borne disease doctor is the one who flea-borne diseases that spot on the joint of the hand, a small one.
And if the blood flow is prohibited, then you put your hand in hot water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your need.
But if you were in the summer days, then you are excused from putting your hand in hot water, and the month is placed with the body of the blood in hot water during winter time.
And the flea-borne disease of this vein is more saved than all the other veins, because it does not have a pulsating vein, nor nerves.
And the flea-borne disease of the small vein of the right hand is concurrent with the diseases of the liver.
And the quality of the flea-borne disease is that you strengthen your hand with a ligament or with your own hand, because you have put it in hot water, until the vein is inflated and is clearly demonstrated at the moment; and then you operate transversally; and if you insert that from top to bottom, you will not recognize it anymore.
And beware that you do not ultimately place your hand in the flea-borne disease doctor, because it is deprived of the nerves of the fingers denuded of flesh.
And then you put your hand in hot water and let the blood run into it, because if you do not put it in hot water, the blood will be coagulated at the orifice of the vein, and its flow is prohibited.
And since the blood is extracted according to the quantity of need, then you pause over the vein with oil and salt, so that it is not consolidated suddenly; and similarly, because you do everything in a straight line.
But the youthful stage of the flea-borne disease of that vein on the left hand is that it is concurrent with the diseases of the spleen.
And thus similarly in the flea-borne disease of him, it happens as it does in the other one.
And the youthful stage of the Sephena vein in flea-borne disease is at the diseases that are on the affected part of the body, thus as it is with the diseases of the mother, and with retention of menses, and with the diseases of the kidneys and ulcers of thighs and legs, and their similar appearances.
And the quality of the flea-borne disease is that the patient inserts their foot in hot water and does it on that friction until the veins appear; and then on the joint of the foot with a cord; and the place of the vein has a visible tail, and from there it ramifies into the face of the foot with many ramifications.
And therefore it is necessary to apply a large poultice around the entire thigh, from the ankle to the knee, which is better and more soothing.
And if you apply poultices on the surface of the foot, then be careful not to irritate the nerves that are underneath the surface of the foot, and stop your poulticing in the area where you applied them across, lest you wish to cause an ulcer.
And these are the soothing poultices.
But if it is prohibited to issue blood; then you should soak the patient's foot in warm water and let the blood flow out of that area so that it may be evacuated.
And if the poultice-maker erred in the first dressing, then soak again with a little poultice, because the area is salty; and do not fear the evil mixture, but rather beware of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly make a dressing on the opposite foot in the same way.
And of the sciatic vein, the area is similar to what we have said, from the knee down to the hollow of the Silvester's joint.
And the juice of the poultice is good for pain in the ankle when it is caused by bad blood.
And the quality of the poultice is that the patient enters into a bath, and fixes and strengthens the bandage of their ankle under the hollow of the thigh beneath the knee beneath four fingers in a long, subtle bandage, because it does not appear to be anything but for this.
And therefore when it appears, then you poultice that place according to each engineer's art that is possible for you and according to the crossing, and it is better; or you ulcerate that place for ulceration or you dry that place for drying, because the area of it is salty.
And it is in many homes a greatly loved thing; and if you touch that, and it does not appear to the whole sentiment, then poultice some part of it, and it is that which appears on the back of the foot, including the auricular and anular digits.
And beware of the nerves, and make flow from the blood as much quantity as you wish.
And then loosen the structure and stop over the area of the poultice, cutting and strengthening the area, because the easing is healthy.
About ventilation and the qualities of using those things.
Ventilations are made with horns, or with iron, or with glass.
And ventilation is done in two manners: one of them is with scarification and blood extraction, and the other is ventilation without scarification.
And this ventilation that is without scarification is done in two ways, because either it is with fire or without fire.
And the ventilations that are administered with scarification and blood extraction are 13 places of the body, among which one place where ventilations are stopped is in the armpit, and it is the last part of the head; and the middle place of two parts of the neck together; and ventilations of the chin below the jawbone below the mouth; and ventilations of two spatulas; and ventilations of alohoster, and it is above the end of the hip; and ventilations of two focus points, and they are of two arms; and ventilations of two cavities; and ventilations of two thighs.
And ventilation does not extract blood except from the small sparse veins in the flesh, and for this reason it does not capture the virtue through them, just as it is captured by poulticing; nor is it known that ventilation is done with fire or without fire in any malady made for replenishment until the entire body is evacuated.
But if it is necessary to provoke ventilation for illness or for continuation, administer that at every hour at the beginning of the month and at its end, and in the middle place of it and at some time.
And therefore when it happens in any of those causes, and properly if it is on the third or middle day of the month, then command ventilation to be done more than two or three hours past the day.
And the juice of ventilation of the neck is that when it confers gravity on the head and to this end that it is founded in the wheels; but it is known that this should be a proper evacuation of the entire body.
And this windiness is at the location of flea-biting of the headache.
It is not lawful to use it on one who has a complete fracture, or in the case of catarrh, because it gives great annoyance.
And for that reason, it is not suitable to use those old things, and in the cases of those who have evil frequent maladies.
More, to him who is continually forgetting about it, it is suitable that you command the wind-remover to place his hand a little above the windy area below, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
More wind-removal of alkahel is at the location of flea-biting of the dark vein and of the basilica: and for that reason it confers asthma, and to the constriction of those and to the scission of the instrument of those, and to all, and to replenishment.
And it is suitable that the wind-removal of alkahel be applied a little, because if it is paused below, it generates debilitation in the body and in the stomach.
And the wind-removal of alhagdahan confers on accidental pains in the head and opthalmia, and migraine, and forehead-pressure, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is at the location of flea-biting of the basilisk.
And it is suitable that you command the wind-remover not to press his hand on the scarification so that he does not incise the artery and accelerate flows of blood.
And wind-removal below the mouth confers on acidity in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and resemblance to those evil maladies that are in the mouth, and it is at the location of flea-biting of the aliharic that are between the two lips.
More, the wind-removal that is made on the two spatulas confers on a warming, which is done for replenishment of heat.
And the wind-removal of the two divided parts of the focus confers on juvenation of the flea-biting of three veins, so it is of the basilica, dark and cephalic, because that attracts the blood from all those veins plus many that are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other large veins enter to bring about the attraction to the three veins.
And command the wind-remover to not proceed with scarification, because the place is denuded of flesh, and below that are nerves and arteries.
And it is a windiness on which is wind-removed over the hips and confers on the hemorrhoids of the backside and the ulcers below.
And it is suitable that you command the wind-remover to be a great windiness, and that it be of iron, because the place indicates a strong desiccation; and strongly those subtle wind-removed areas are scarified in scarification.
More wind-removed areas of the smallest veins manifest for minimal manifestation, because they attract the blood from the whole body, and confer on ancient pains of the joints and of the matrix, and of the bladder; and provoke menstruations, and confer on bothor and ademil; and it is at the location of flea-biting of two sophenas, and alahorcoben, and of two cavities.
However, I will not translate this sentence as it appears to be a mix of words from different languages and doesn't form a coherent phrase in the medieval medical treatise language. It seems to be a jumbled collection of words.
And from the wind-removed areas alahorcoben, the juvenation is propelled to the juvenation of the wind-removed areas of two veins.
And the quality of the position of the wind-removed areas is that it pauses the windiness at the commencement of the evacuation and sucks for tempered suction, and does not prolong the position of the wind-removed areas, more pauses those lightly, and remains coytaded, and that the humors come to the location for adventitious ingual. And do not cease iterating that and continue until you see the location already enraged and inflated and that appears the rigor of the blood.
And then you scarify and iterate the suction little by little, and properly consider in the disposition of the body.
Because that man who has tender flesh of rare pores, it is suitable that you scarify him moderately and not too much, so that the place may not be ulcerated.
And command the wind-remover to amplify the scarification and make a little impression, and temper the suction with facility.
And if the blood is gross, then it is suitable to scarify two moderate impressions, because in the first impression, the way of subtlety to the blood and to its acquosity is opened. More in the second, the scrutiny acquired of the extraction of the gross blood.
And if the blood is very feculent, then it is suitable to make a third scarification impression in order to cleanse the latter.
And finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, it is enough for us to make one scarification.
And if we want to extract much blood, we make a moderate scarification; and if we know that the blood is gross, then it is suitable to make a profound scarification.
And the term of surgical incision in which lies the depth of the codeina as much as possible.
And if the codeina is thick, hard, dark, and the juices are very strained, it means that the places of the ventoses are not tenderly touched, but rather resolved openly; if it is in summer time, then use oil of aloen or oil of violet, or oil of bitter herbs, or oil of chamomile; and if it is in winter time, then use oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of camamille, or of sanctum, and to those that seem similar.
And if the superficies are thick, frozen, then use oil of marjoram, or oil of balsamite, or oil of aloen, or oil of anise, and to those that seem similar.
But if the ventoser is of ample pores to tender flesh, then it means that oil is prohibited, and it means that one should apply those places of ventoses with a gentle lavation of warm water or cold water of solatrum, or water of chamomile, or water of bordeaux, and similarly to those.
And that one whose wound is of much humidity, wash its ventoses with a gentle agreement, or with water of myrtle and sumac, and similarly to those.
And that one whose superficies are thick, wash its ventoses with gentle antiquity, or with water of sage, which is majorana, or of decoction of anise, or of chamomile, and to those that seem similar.
And it means that the ventosation should be kept away from bathing; having meant that it should be administered close to the bath for an hour or two, and it means that one should sleep close to the ventosation.
What is needed so that a veinous person should be governed by blood-letting before ventosation.
It means that you should consider the commencement: then if the ventoser or one who needs to be blood-let is choleric and vents about the wound with agitation and inflammation, then it means that you should take causes of cooling, such as milgrana acetosa, and endivia in a gentle agreement, and laytigua, and julep, and similarly to those.
And pause at their wanderings, such as poultices, and carnations of ausel's serums, and wanderings conjoined with agreements, and to those that seem similar.
And of that one whose complexion is frozen, it means that you should take in drinking eyssarop almiva, or eyssarop of ausel's serums of sesame, and sumac, and there is much odorant migier between viel and noel; and that it is commanded to use little drinking and eating, and pause the wanderings of their poultices and canabir and pissers and small ausels and colombat.
And it means that on the day of ventosation and phlebotomy, the drinking should be more than the wandering.
And it means that you should give in drinking at certain hours to certain homes tyrical alpharac, or medicaments of musk, so it is muscada, or alceta away from ventosation or phlebotomy or close by, so that the principal members are comforted and the wound is subtled; and it does not mean that you should take that scalping.
But the ventoses that are operated on with scarification are those that are paused on the feet, and on the gouty and podagra, and on the umbelic, in the places of the joints, and the pixida of the ankle, because these members do not suffer from scarification above them.
And it is not sought for those except attraction of wound of member, such as pausing ventosa on mamilha in bad flux of wound of the veins; and using that per that the ventosation is dissolved, frozen and inviscated from the member, such as pausing on the belly and umbelic; because that rarefies the member and scales it and reduces the pain since it resolves ventosation.
And it is paused on the roots when they are stuck in their operation or poultice, because by virtue of strong attraction the humble operation eradicates the poultice from its place.
And similarly it is paused on the feet and gouty areas, where ventosation is enclosed in those.
And these ventoses are administered with juice as much as possible; and some vegetables are administered with focus.
And some vegetables are administered full of water, steeped in the bad fluxes of the gouty areas.
And that is why the ventosa should be filled and should be pushed grandly, so it is boiling water alone or water in which herbs are cooked for that convenience.
Form of ventosa administered with focus: it is the amplitude of the orrifici of two digits, according to which we have formed it; and the quantity of the preon should be the width of a palm; and it should be in the latz of it, in the place that is in the circuit, the width of it, the trauc should be small according to the quantity that enters into it through a needle.
It is made of raw ram's horn, of thick margins, lion, and eagles, through which the member is not led astray from its position on it.
And make a mixture of the transverse vein of the ram or iron, where you will place a lit candle at the fire.
And this is the great remedy that we have recommended; and the small pain of that, according to the illnesses and the state of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses of the old men are extended to others, whereas those of the young and robust bodies.
And the quality of placing this cupping glass over the member is that it extends the flame from the decent candle made of wax, and places it above the transverse vein in the middle of the place of the cupping glass, so that the fire is kindled around the part below, so that the body of the patient is not burned.
And then it is placed over the member of the patient, and the finger is on the hole that we have mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glasses and do not indicate that they obstruct the finger and release the vapor through that hole, then the cupping glass will soon be dissolved.
And you should ignite the wick according to its manner, and then you will indicate if it is obstructed by that.
There is a cupping glass that is administered in the case of flatulence, with water, in which there is no transverse vein nor hole, and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and it is placed over the member alone.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better, because it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 148.
Blood-letting is not administered in many members except in those members where it is not possible to place cupping glasses, due to their smallness, such as the vein and gum, which seem like them; or in a member denuded of flesh, such as the finger and nose, and thus they seem.
And the quality of using those that you have found blood-letting cups that are on the dirty and polluted parts of the body.
And then they are washed with dirty water during the day and night until they are famished, and that no remaining cause is in the belly of those; and then the body is evacuated through flebotomy and cupping glasses; and then the member of the patient is cooled until it becomes red; and then they are placed over it.
And since they are filled and in a case.
And if it is possible to suck from the place with the cupping glass, it is better to delay in juvenation.
And if not, then wash the place with wine and then with much water; and it is cooled and extracted.
And if the body of the blood is prolonged by the administration of blood-letting cups, and it is that which remains, then you put a piece of cloth in cold water, and place that over it until the remaining fluid is absorbed.
And if the blood is multiplied, then powder over it with vitriol thrice, or gall and similarly to them of the stiptic causes, until the blood is abscessed; or place over the location the mastics of excruciated beans, and they are washed until the beans adhere to the location, and the blood is abscessed.
And it is necessary, if required, to repeat the blood-letting, when it is possible to change them.
And if the blood-letting cups are prohibited from suspension, then cool the place with recent blood or fix a needle in the places until blood is obtained; and then they are placed, because those who feel any blood at all adhere to it.
And when you want them to fall, powder over them a little of thrice-tried aloe, or salt, or cinder, and it will happen soon.
Thus begins the third part: on restoration. This chapter is very necessary in the art of medicine; and it is about the restoration of fracture and accidental dislocation in the bones.
Oh, son, you know that they throw away this chapter, the foolish doctors and the vulgar ones, and those who for a long time did not regard the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter.
And for this reason it is made that this manner of the sciences in our land is private; and you do not have it and have forgotten it all at once; and no one has inhabited it since, except by length of reading of the books of the Ancients and study on the understanding of those, until they extract the science from them.
And then I will direct an experiment and study in the length of my own life.
And I have already described in this chapter all that contains my science and about which I have passed my experiment; since I have abbreviated it for you others and delivered it from occupation of prolongation; and I will abbreviate it at the end of abbreviation; and I will show it at the end of declaration; and I will form it in many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as is done by addition of declaration, thus I have done in two preceding chapters.
First chapter.
Summary and collections from being broken bones, from which the necessary preliminary is, before we begin the remembrance of fractured members and diverse ones. Therefore, we will discuss in the proem of this chapter the summaries of the sermon; and the chapters to the understanding of those which from the beginning are forced by the artisans and stationed over the truth of these; so it is you and those that are so prompt that they know or apprehend this noble art better than you.
And therefore it is said that when accidents occur due to fracture or dislocation or twisting or fall, then it is known that you should begin with flebotomy or alleviation of that, or some remedies, if no cause prohibits, and thus with debilitation of virtue, or it is that which occurs suddenly, or it is in decrepit state, or it is a time of vehement heat, or of vehement cold.
And then be content with a diet of fresh herbs and lean meats of birds and crabs; and prohibit gross meats and fill up on diets and entire diets that fill the veins with blood, so that you will be secure from apostemeous ulcers, and if you do not fear effusion of matter to the members.
And then return the patient to their first regimen as is customary for them.
And then when the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is known that the patient should be fed with nutritious diets of subtle and light nutriment, and not viscous, such as those diets made from flour, water, rice, cabbage, peas, fresh fish, and similar things, and in this regimen there is a coagulation of fracture pus, which is easier to heal.
And you know that the broken bones, when they are in the old men who are in the first weakness and in the decrepit states, it is not possible that they can continue and be consolidated according to their nature through the desiccation of their members.
But the Emperor Nature adjusts and connects above the broken bone of the whole party any cause similar to glue in which it is grossly that adheres and strengthens until they are conglomerated and united, until they reach the end of fortitude and firmness, just like a focus at the beginning, until no cause prohibits that from their works.
And for this reason it is necessary that you pause the diets of the patient, diets in which there are gravity and viscosity and grossness, just as we have said.
And you know that the species of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the members, for a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from the fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is different from the fracture of the bone of the back; and similarly all the other members are diverse among themselves.
And I have come to a remembrance of all species of fracture, explained in their distinct chapter, separate from the other.
A variety of fracture in itself, in its own measure. And the species of fracture of the bone are diversified in their own measures; for there is a curved fracture other than that which occurs in the stars; and some veiled ones are made into fractures according to the length of the bone: and so the fractures of the sagittal and stellar and additional proceeding and not-proceeding, just as it is made in the pain when it is prepared to write, and it is a fracture with plague and disruption in the head, and it is a fracture of small fissure.
And to each species belongs a proper torment in restoration of it according to what will come as a remembrance of it, distinctly in its own places.
A sign or indication of fracture of the bone. And for that reason it is known as fracture of the bone: it is a twistedness of it, and of its prominence and appearance to the sentiment, and so of it when it comprises that with your hand.
And then when it is not in the place of apparent twistedness nor is it felt by the finger touching when it touches the bone with agitation and the patient does not feel great pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there is twistedness or small fissure, therefore you do not feel with your hand and with compression of all; however, pause over it from the medicines of which I have remembrance at that moment when it convenes to the place; and then be straight for subtle structuring.
And you know that the place where it is curved and not divided into two or another thing that does not occur in the sagittal, as it is remembered by all parties of its comparison, then it is known that it begins from your hour to rectification of it, however, that it occurs with apostemeous ulcers.
And if it occurs with apostemeous ulcers, then leave that for some days until the ulcer ceases; and then begin to treat it according to whatever manner you can of levitation and of ingenium.
You know that restoration of it and agility of it are more necessary than the bones in which accidents occur.
And then strengthen that second when memory of it will return.
Perhaps in the bones so shattered, then extension of this broken member from two parts is necessary, whether it's the hand or the foot; or you have your hand if the member is small; or use two cords or a cord and the hand.
And it's your position in which you hold the member in its natural figure, while the extended parts of the broken member are then perforated, so that you make those additions return to their place and according to each manner that you can put them in their places.
And beware that you don't fall on the patient during your operation, neither injuring nor lesioning; and perform according to your gentle power that you apply one bone with another, its companion, according to their best forms.
And it is good that at that hour you touch with your hand there, and if sometimes here is a different cause, correct that and set it in order according to the quantity of your virtue.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, thus as many foolish doctors who make vain attempts to accelerate aposteme with their operation, or make counter-operations on the member, thus as we have seen through the operations of their vain attempts.
And the quality of the structure of the tranquil member is that which you have recommended; because you know that broken members are diversified in their smallness and greatness and in the form of those.
And of those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the knee, and similar to those, then it's good that the wrapping be with very subtle cloth.
Perhaps those that are large, such as the hip or the leg, it's good that in those there be a hard and durable wrapping, because the strong connection connects the big member and strengthens it entirely with equal structure, so that in it no bruise enters.
And then begin, adjust your evacuation of equality, pause a suitable ligament according to that, above the place of that fracture with three wrappings or four according to the member's merit; and strengthen your hand a little on the ligament.
And then see that it is in that part above the place of the fracture, and strengthen yourself so that you don't force your structure on the place of the fracture. And then elongate yourself in the wrapping of the place of the fracture a little, and soften the small structure little by little, until you take hold of the place with a great part.
And then take another bandage and wrap it around the broken place with wrapping, and then see that the wrappings are on the part below the fracture; and be your operation in the structure of the wrapping and in softening of it according to what we have said in the primary wrapping above.
And then pause between the turns of wrapping with a smooth cloth or fabric on which the tortuosity of the fracture is equalized, if there is tortuosity in it; and otherwise, don't pause in it for any cause.
And then pause on the other bandage, and then equalize on these wrappings decently made so far, if in the place there is no inflammation or aposteme, and then pause on it which sits the aposteme that and stops the inflammation; and leave it like that for some days; and then you strengthen on the wrapping.
And these wrappings are of the majesty of cane or strong reed, and be formed wisely; or of wood of pine; or of ribs of palm; and let each wrapping be according to this form and figure.
However, it's good that the wrapping which is paused on that fracture be a little thicker and stronger than the other wrappings, and the length of the stake according to what is suitable for the member in greatness and smallness; and then strengthen on the wrappings with another bandage according to your primary structure; and then bind below decently as we have said about structure, and it's that your structure be according to the place of the fracture itself, and when more is aligned from the fracture, it's lessened the structure.
And it's good that the threads be medium in thickness and subtlety, and be of soft wool; and if the threads are thick, thus as you have seen through the operation of some foolish doctors pausing the threads of twisted cords of wool, and it's a great error, when one doesn't hold the structure for equality.
And in this way the subtle remedies are not so convenient, because you do not constrict them by strict structure as those that you want, and it does not happen that between this and that there is less than a day's worth.
And if the patient is led by the extremities of the stars to put structure in their places, then stop those of stopping the lion or the caramelized entrails so that it does not make a lesion.
Some broken fractures are a plague, and accidents cause disruption in the code, and you will find a reminder in that chapter according to singularity.
And you know that not all broken members are straight on the first day; the cause is because the member, when it's large, does not fit onto the stars until about five or seven days, according to your secure advancement of abscess caution.
And this is the manner of the implants in which the Ancients restored them, which they placed on fracture and dislocation and torsion.
Method of implantation as an abbreviation of restoration of fracture, convenient for complex joints and majorment to the femurs and to the effigies, because it is about that on which there is no heat nor cold: and it is that you take powder of millet, and it is the marrow of the flour that gives movement to the mill in the walls of the millet.
And you will find that it is like this, except that you sieve that one in the white album of egg, and stop the complexation of it not being spacious nor subtle; and then use that.
Another manipulation for implanting a fracture and dislocation and twisting: recipe of assafetida, lapdanum, acacia, enula, and migrach, which is the root of milgraner salvage, one dram; mirra and aloen one dram five; alochil one dram twenty; all are mixed and stirred and then blended with water or album of Huou if the complexity of the patient's wound is scaled; and then use this implant, because it is of good composition and restores the broken bones quite rightly, and confers a lot of homes.
Another manipulation for implanting which confers a fracture and twisting: recipe of migrach and a half dram of white alta, one dram; mirra and aloen one dram five; acacia one dram six; Armenian bol one dram twenty.
All things are ground in a mortar with a very contrary motion, and all things are sieved, and all things are confected in the water or in the white album of egg and it is administered.
Method of implantation for joints and separated bones in their places, and then accidental pain occurs in those and in fissures and fractures: take a lane's poultice and immerse it in warm oil and cut it and place it on the area.
More in this implantation there is no virtue of restoration, of cautious abscess and expelling pains properly.
Another method of implantation that restores broken bones: take flowers of fig tree sort and flowers of saved poppy; mix all and make an implantation of theirs.
Method of implantation abbreviated administered for restoration of fracture of bones and when you want resolution of the remaining abscess: recipe mixture of alta, of chamomile and flowers of violets, of flour of peas, of all in a part. all things are ground and all things are cooked in wine, if the member is not scalded.
More if it is scalded, then you find that one in water of hot colander or in water and use it.
Another method of implantation that is very strong in resolution, which is this first one, when it aids abscess during restoration of the member: recipe of mixture of alta and of sesame of lydia, and of balaustia, and mellilot, majorana, flowers of violet, of chamomile, of all in a part; all things are ground and all things are cooked in water of sage or in water of dousa or in wine, all that according to the quality of the member and the rest of its color.
More Hippocrates did not dissect in the free will that it is placed on the broken member during restoration of it, unless cerote makes a layer of wax and oil and no other cause; and recommends that it is mixed between grossness and subtlety.
More in Galen's opinion it is seen that all things are placed on the broken member during restoration of it and the causes in which it is dryness with little warmth so like myrrh, incense and similar to those causes that we have recommended.
Many types of plaster that can be applied to the lesion and pain: take miga powder, from cedar, from pellets of a man's urine or from juniper, and from altea, and salt, divided into equal parts; apply trissat and cribellat, and apply cofit, and make a proper plaster.
Measure the quantity according to which you think will remain the ligature and then dislocate it, so that you consider if there is no accident, nor prick, nor the bone is broken, nor it has moved from its place, then you do not delay more than two days. And if you find the place of violent pain or prick or inflammation, then you touch or delay it at that hour, and remove its plaster.
And take a cloth of linen and marine sponge humid, and submerge it in warm water, and with that wash the place until the prick and pain are calmed; and then let the member rest for an hour; and then pause above the lane under the submerged bandage, with vinegar and oil or rose oil, and leave it on for a night until you are sure of avoiding apostema, and that the inflammation of the member is reduced, and the pain is alleviated.
And then apply a subtle structure and small plaster, not too strong for your primary construction, and subtly add it until it is healthy.
And if sometimes the apostema and redness and pain and inflammation and all the accidents are completely removed, and you have dispensed with plasters and structures, then you will apply it thus, as you have done from the beginning of the treatment.
And if you do not find any cause in the member among those that we have mentioned, then do not delay it unless for three days or four or five. and some remedies that are applied for 20 days according to how it appears per the dislocation of the member, thus as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and it approaches the coagulation of the flesh over it.
And then adjust in the structure more than in your primary structure altogether, and assist in the digestion of the patient's food, according to what is preceded by the reminiscence of it.
More often if you find the place of the fracture is dried and extended more than it should not cover, then you know that the nutrient is prohibited from reaching it; and therefore wrap it with warm water altogether, which has been applied to it; and it will be in all three days; and loosen the structure a little, and by this operation correct the member's nutrient, and it will be healthily restored.
More often it happens that the foolish restorers of a fractured member do another treatment when it is not restored from the beginning, according to what covers it, and it is restored according to their own twistedness, which is an error according to the operation of theirs, and great fear, and if they were directors, they would aggravate the ancient ills in their free books and would have worked on that.
And I have not seen any of them who have done anything reasonable, because it is more reasonable that they do nothing.
Head chapter: On fractures that occur in the head.
The species of fractures are many, and their figures are diverse, and the causes are distinct, because some fractures are made by percussion of the spine, and the percussion removes all the bone within the skull, which is behind the bone, thus as it has been said in the fuse, and for this reason this species is called ascial; or the spine insinuates into some part of the bone, and insinuates the flesh of it and does not pass into the posterior of it; and this species of fracture is called absolute levation.
And the plague of these two fractures is great or small, and of fracture that is contraction or attrition; and its cause is percussion with a stone or fall on a stone, and it seems to them.
And this fracture is penetrating that approaches near the periosteum which is behind the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the plague of these two fractures is great or small.
And of fracture that is diminished in the bone, in the subtlety of the small hair, and for this reason this species of fracture is called capillary.
And it is a fracture that is made or by fall or by percussion of the stone and it seems to them, that makes some lamina of the bone enter into the deep parts, and it is made in the concave place thus as it occurs in the rows of the bone when they occur by their percussion and are part of their entrance into the deep parts.
And mostly it is made in the bodies of human bones, thus as they are the heads of joints.
And so all these species of fractures are classified, so they are weights thus as they are separate stars. And I will find the remembrance of all that in its place.
And I will discuss all these species of fracture by detection over them and by inquiry into their tents and signs of corrupted flesh that is upon them.
The special hair-like fibers are recognized by being discovered on the bone, and they are extracted, and anointed with a thin layer, because the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of fractures, consider at the beginning the accidents of the patient, and then if you see signs that manifest clearly on the skin, such as vomiting from cholera, and extension, and loss of understanding, and absence of votes, and syncope, and acute fever, and efflux of humors, and rigor of those, and it seems similar to their major dispositions, so it does not seem healthy.
And if you see non-concurrent accidents, you hope for health, then you begin the treatment of it.
The cause is because it has come to you in the beginning with plague-like symptoms and this is during the winter days, then you should study the osteological arrangement of the bone on the 14th day according to all dispositions.
And if it is during the summer days, then you should touch the bone on the 7th day, having that what was left on the bone is corrupted by the panicle, and that accidents occur which we have recounted.
And if the fracture has already penetrated to the panicle covering the brain, and it is with divided and atrophied parts, then you should inject the divided and atrophied part, according to what you have recounted to yourself.
And it is that you shave the head of the patient plagued, and discover on the bone according to custom and manner possible to yourself, following the figure of the plague, and that it be lighter on the patient.
And if it happens to you to make the detection of the bone, either by blood or post-crisis caution, then you oppose yourself to it as it is necessary, and it is that you fill the place of drapughts infused with wine and rose oil, and make the plague repose until the apostema is sedated, and you are sure of the flow of blood; and then begin in the circulation of the bone and in its ablation.
And that is according to one of two manners of operation.
And one manner is that you inject the bone with a straight instrument, and this is its form: Then administer another injection like this, a little further apart than that; and this is its form.
And then administer more injections farther apart according to the sequence.
And it is necessary to have various injections of different names, some of which are farther apart than others; and some of them are shorter than others and are in the last stage of their extreme parts, and are of iron or felon.
And use them to facilitate percussion on the injection site so that it does not touch the head and leads to that.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary to perforate in its circuit from within while you administer the injections with the tubes, which are called non-deep tubes.
And they are not named thus except that those do not reach the term of the bone to what is adjacent to it, so that the tube is rounded at the extremity or margin above what remains of the head of the needle, resembling a small circle, which prohibits being submerged and passes the spissitude of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take many of these tubes which almost converge at the spissitude of each bone, until they are presented to you in all tests of the brain with the extremity of which is pointed, the quantity in length and brevity being according to the quantity of spissitude of this test.
And this is the form of three species of tubes: The quality of perforating in the circuit of the broken bone is that it pauses the tube on the bone and revolves around the ties until you know that the bone has already been penetrated; and then permutes the tube to another place, and pauses what is between all the tracts, according to the quantity of the grossness of the radius or environment.
And then inject with injections what is between each tract of the bone, and make that more subtle which you place on it in the end of levitation, as we have said, until you radiate the bone, or hold your hand, or for some other cause to stir up the instruments which will be prepared for that, as we have touched upon and with forceps and subtle strengths.
And it is necessary that you keep all caution so that the injection does not touch any cause of the cipher.
And thus you will have circuited the perforated bone, and it will be separated from the cipher if it is continued in it, and you will have extracted that, it is necessary to reason and equalize that in the asperity of it from what is in the bone with another instrument similar to an injection, more imperial because it is thinner and more subtle than the other injections.
And if you remain with some small bone fragments and satangia, then take that facilitated to what is necessary for you of the instruments; and then cure the plague in the lynxes and unite those which we have said.
And the other manner of operation is to scrape, far from pain, which Galen and the experts say is for great sorcery; and this is the sermon of it: it is necessary for you at the beginning that begins to discover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most violent and most manifest, until when you have discovered that part and you have placed it beneath the extremity of this slow and gentle inscissor, which is the form.
It is that the lenticular part is lazy and does not incise any cause, and the acute part is of it in two directions beforehand in longitude, thus sometimes; so that the lenticular part should be adjusted to the ciphac on the face of the incident acute bone.
And then you percussion over the incision of a part with a small hammer until you have incised the whole bone to facilitate thus as it is revolved, and you will be secure from the panniculus that does not fall into the accident that happens in no manner, and if the medicant was the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of their lore; certainly, and if it was dormant.
When you have reached the Romania of some annexed cause to the bone of the panniculus in certain places of the bone, you will incise that of it with the extremity of the lenticular incisor, and you will deliver that of it facilitated, because it is delivered from its injury and its pain.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the panniculus, and what is absorbed or removed from the bone is its face, and you remain in its roughness and subtle saggings, then it is necessary that you remove that roughness and eradicate those saggings with subtle razors for which you have prepared the number, of various quantities so that you can possibly administer them in every place most convenient to them and most direct according to what you perceive in your operation on that broken bone and its figure.
And it is necessary that you administer in your razor at the time when the bone begins to be most latent of those razors, and then use the most subtle part of it, and do not cease until according to continuity you have achieved administering the whole tone and the whole subtle part of all those.
Moreover, in some of the other small capillary fractures and subtle fracture, it is necessary that you administer care according to what you perceive in order to achieve rectification of it.
And it is the cause that has not been diminished regarding all those who have studied in that art. And we will stop on what we have written and shown you about great fractures.
And if the panniculus is retightened when you eradicate the bone, then it is necessary that you take a drap of oil according to the quantity of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the orifice of the wound; and then take another doubled or tripled drap and submerge it in wine and rose oil and place it over the primary drap and do it as much as possible that you can about that, so that it does not gravitate towards the ciphac; and then administer over that latent liament, and do not stretch it unless for the quantity that the wound has, solely.
And leave that on for a day or two until you are secure from apostemic caution; and then remove it and administer medicines as those which are superfluous dryness, thus with linseed oil and flour of barley, and powder of lichen and aristology, and similar to those.
And it is that you make of these powdered medicines that are pulverized over the wound, thus as they are dry; and universally, administer in all medicine of property of which it is that it cleanses and does not bite.
And beware according to your virtue that the wound in your cure is clean; and it is not in the surdity of evil intent nor another; nor do not let virulence accumulate in it; because when it is adjusted over the panniculus of the brain, it corrupts it and poisons it, and falls upon the patient with that malignant malice.
And it falls upon the ciphac of the head, as of it is mondified bone and majorly when the cure of it is misrepresented, and it is blackened on the surface of it; and therefore consider then that it falls upon the patient with the accidents that we have said, knowing that it is perilous and all doctored.
And if it does not fall black except from the medicine that is placed beneath, and it is in virtue of that medicine that makes that blackness, then it is necessary that you take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil. and in those lines take a drap, and then place it over the ciphac; and then cure it with the species of cure that converge until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that it is not broken nose but two parties together, or one of those curved veins, because there are two bones, because the party below is cartilaginous, and it is not broken and does not fall to it except with attrition and tortuosity and sinuity.
If one of the two broken parts is fractured, then it is necessary that you introduce the small instrument into the nasal passage, and that you adjust that fracture in the same direction as the indicator, and in the same direction as the poultice beforehand, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And make it easy for you to facilitate, and be careful that you do not fall into that pitfall during your operation on the patient's abdomen.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it does not perceive to that, then it is necessary that it be equalized with the extremity of the file on which it has been slightly thickened.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you make the similarity to that.
And try to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then place the vi or x of the rest of the postulate caution.
And introduce into the extremity of the nose a piece of cloth of linen, if the fracture is in one part, or two small gauzes, if the fracture is in two parts, and let it be in the thickened gauze of as much quantity that fills the hole of the nose.
And thus some of the ancient restorers said that the gauzes should be infused in borage, and should be changed every day, but it has not been seen by me; however, it is necessary that the piece be infused in a mixture of honey and powder of moly; and then leave the gauze until the bone is firm and the cartilage is strengthened.
And some vegetables should be inserted into the nose, in place of a gauze, wrapped in a cloth of linen thread; and it is that you already have the fracture of the nose strongly and that the patient is not prohibited from inspiration.
And this cause is not necessary to you; and if you want, do that, and if you want, do gauzes.
And if another vegetable postulate caution occurs, apply the nose with a wax candle or anointed with agreeable oil and rose oil, or with diaculum.
If another postulate caution does not occur, then it is necessary to apply beforehand with the powder of sisamum and the powder of coffinseeds in a mixture of honey; and then pause on the cloth of linen, and do not lift the nose for any cause.
If the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture or so comminuted, then it is necessary to separate them from those, and extract them with instruments that are convenient for them; and then close the suture, and cure it in such a way that it encarnates and consolidates, and applies convenient emplasters to them.
And if a plague touches the nose, then it is necessary to cure it with gauzes and administer lead tubes until it is completely healthy.
Chapter 4.
On the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.
When the jaw is broken and the fracture of it is not with plague, consider then if the fracture is only slightly so, and not broken in two and curved to the adjacent parts, then its cognition is easier.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you introduce the small indicator on the left in the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is on the left jaw, then introduce the indicator on the right hand; and you will find that the reduction of the fracture is facilitated by the parts beforehand, with your other hand on the preceding part of the bone; and thus it is decently equalized.
And if the fracture of the jaw is separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension of the two parts according to rectitude until it is possible to equalize them.
And if the teeth are dislocated by concussion, then strengthen those with which you expect to remain in a thread of gold or silver or cedar; and then pause on the broken jawbone candle, and then pause on the double cloth, and pause on the large star-shaped cloth decently made, or a sole wrap along the length of the jaw; and then bind it underneath according to how you have prepared the ligature of it and how it is convenient for application, until it is not destroyed.
And command the patient to rest and tranquilize, and pause the food of his swollen lips.
And if you esteem that the figure has already been altered in some manner, then you correct it and remove it from the third day; and then rectify what has already been altered of it and apply it with powder of moly, or a mixture of honey, or powder of sisamum, since you have removed the candle from it, and pause on the applied cloth of linen.
And then come and adjust that emplaster on it, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, leave it like that, which does not dislodge until it is healthy and strengthens the fracture; because many vegetables have strengthened this fracture in three weeks.
And if another affected area is found, then administer what we have said in the previous treatments for similar conditions in the sediment of the patient, so that it may be healed and the aposteme may be removed.
And if the fracture is a painful wound, then consider whether it is a separated or displaced bone, then you subtly examine those displacements to see what is convenient for their removal in the restoration of the injured parts.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you enlarge it according to the quantity of your need, following the rules of flebotomy.
And when you have removed those displacements, and none will remain there, then you close the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place one of the suitable emplausters that are convenient for that and encrust it, until it may be healed.
Chapter 5.
On the restoration of the ankle when it is injured.
Similar treatments are broken down into three ways when the ankle is injured from a blow in front of the muscles, and that fracture is made in one of three manners.
Because it is broken, or separated, or separated into two parts that do not touch, and it is easier to restore it; or it happens that they touch in the displacements, and it is difficult to restore it; or it happens that the fracture is a painful wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is a painful wound, is that you have two ministers present, so that one holds the injured ankle and the other extends their arm to that part.
And then unite the fracture with the ties in the correct form according to its shape, so that it is not prominent or concave.
And if you need more extension, then it is suitable to place a small pillow of cloth or wool under the patient's thigh, and its size should be according to your need; and lift and elevate the ankle and shorten the distance with your hand until you unite the fracture as it suits.
And if you cannot reach the extremity of the ankle to the previous parts, because it is perverted to the knee, then it is suitable that the patient be placed on their back, and a cushion should be placed under the muscle of one thigh, in great size.
And the minister should place their hand under the muscle of the thigh to the parts below until the bone of the ankle is elevated as it is in its natural position, and then you correct the fracture and unite it with the ties in the correct form.
But if you feel displacements of the ankle and its joints, then it is suitable to bend over that and extract those displacements in order to facilitate.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you make an incision on it with one of the instruments that have been prepared for that, because you had placed under the ankle the instrument that serves as a ciphac; and this instrument is made of wood or iron, which has the shape of it.
And it is similar to a scoop whose concavity is such; and its width should be according to what is necessary for it, according to the size of the bone or its weakness.
But the length of it should be according to what is possible for you in the operation; that there are two extremities thus at times, and one extremity is wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you extracted the displacement of the bone is wide, and there is no sign of aposteme caution, then you adjust the two lips of the wound to a suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear aposteme caution, then you fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the quantity of the scission of the wound.
And if you suspect aposteme caution, then you put a warm cloth on it and anoint it with oil and rose water, and place it on top of that.
And thus, it is not hidden the sheet from the broken bone; and therefore it is suitable that you see the patient every day, so that when the ligament is mollified or the sheet is about to be removed, then you correct it and strengthen the bond.
And then pause the sleep of the patient over their neck, and place underneath them the small cushion at night; so that it will be elevated with the help of their latz, and thus the fracture of the furcula is elevated by the muscle; or their arm is tied to their neck.
And do not dislocate the ligament if it does not come together in the right place or abscess, within twelve days.
And then renew the plaster if you have seen their face to that water, and adjust in the structure and restore it so that it is restored and the fracture of the furcula is coagulated.
And it is strengthened and comforted according to the month in 28 days, and some vegetables are made in some homes which are done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
On the restoration of a fracture of the shoulder.
The splint is broken in the broad part of their side and does not break except at the edges.
And then when the place of theirs is broken — and it is broken in the middle part of theirs — and it is not recognized except by touch, then according to the figure of the fracture forces you to prepare theirs and reduce it according to the natural figure in all manner of art, as it is possible for you.
And then pause on the dusty place of many album of Huou and stop lion; and then pause pulverized double cloth; and then pause on the subtle star of table according to the quantity of the whole splint or a little more.
Perhaps the star is concave in some of the places of the splint, then you engage that concavity with stopped lion, and then push the star according to equality.
And then strengthen below with a long humanation against decent constriction and firmness of the star until it is not removed from its own place.
And consider the ligament every day; and all vegetables that are mollified, another vegetable strengthens it and equals the star if it is removed from its own place.
And heal the patient over their own broad side there.
And the splint is restored in 20 days or in 25.
And then when this number is completed, then you dissolve the ligament, and you will know for certain that it is from the bones which were not tempered nor their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the place of the bone to the ankle and put underneath the bandage, then you will sinew over it, and remove it, and do according to what we have said in the fracture of the furcula of sad apostema, cautiously so that it comes together here.
Chapter 7.
On the restoration of a fracture of the foot.
The foot, some vegetables are broken in the middle part of it and that tart ends; perhaps the extremities of its motion end there, which are cicatrized and comminuted.
And of the accidents of theirs when it is broken in the middle of it, it declines into the internal parts and comes together with great pain, and difficulty in walking, and stumbling, and strong weakness, and vomiting blood; and it is declared in the cavity of the broken bone and does not hide from the sensation.
And the restoration of it is that the patient is resupinated over their own back, and placed between their shoulders a small cushion; and then pressed on their muscles, and adjusted their ribs with two rib-counters, and subtly worked on the operation of it and in the equation according to all manner that is possible and that converges to it, until the figure of the bone returns as it was.
And then pause on the plaster and stop and pause above the subtle star of table of sauce or of calyx and of their similar levitation, since you envelop it in cloth; and then subtly work on binding that above the broken bone so it is not moved; and go with a bond according to what is returned to the back some vegetables, and strengthen it with decent constriction; and then consider the bond at all hours, and when it is mollified, strengthen it.
And if it is necessary to provoke the dislocation of that which causes corrosion or bruising, or pain, or apostema that comes together in the place, then you cut and dissect that and eradicate the plaster and rectify what comes together for the manner of cure of theirs; and then reduce the plaster, if it returns to its face; and adjust its structure until it is healthy.
Chapter 8.
On the restoration of the ribs when they are cracked.
You know that a fracture of the ribs does not happen except in gross places that follow the back; and of the extremities of theirs from the part above they do not come together with contraction but for what is cartilaginous. And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the sensation, because of the inquiry of it with the fingers.
And the restoration is thus that it unites the fracture with the fingers according to the possible manner, until it is united as it was, and then plasters and strengthens the broken bone with star, if it needs that.
If the fracture of the ribs is declining towards the internal parts, then it brings violent pain and puncture, just as puncture brings to one who has experienced pleasure, and for this reason the bones are placed in the wrapping; and it brings difficulty to handle, and thus, and vomiting of much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And already the Antics are engineered in that limb with many ingenious devices.
And they say that it is necessary to pause the veins of the patient that generate inflammation and windiness, so that the belly may be inflated and extended, and the fracture may be driven towards the outer parts.
We have avoided this so that it does not cause a light fever to generate a hot abscess, if it does not succeed; and if it does succeed, then it helps with that.
And they say that some of them should be paused under the wind and then sucked with a strong fortitude; and it seems like a rationalization, but I, emperor, am afraid that the wind will attract the excesses to the place of debilitation.
And they say that some of them: it is necessary for the place to be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and powders are paused between the ribs until it is filled, which is the binding wound when enveloping according to the second intention; and then the patient is cured with a cure of pleasing wind and medicine.
And if it causes violent constraint to the patient who does not suffer, and the bones do puncture with a sharp point, I think about the patient, then it is necessary to bind above the place, uncovering the broken rib, and then pause over that instrument that preserves the cipher, the remembrance of which is preceding, and that inserts the bones in a facilitated way, and extracts that.
And then adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a dressing, and cure that with emplasters until it is healed.
And if it succeeds in generating an abscess, then you touch and pour powders into rose oil and pause over the place, and the patient is cured with that which is necessary for the abscess to be generated.
And it is resurrected upon the mattress on which he sleeps, until it is healed.
Chapter 9.
On the restoration of fractures of the spine and neck.
Some veiled injuries reveal fractures in the neck bones, and similarly they attribute to their own attribution, and likewise to the spine of the back. And when it succeeds in revealing some of them and you want to know if it will be healed or not, then consider, because if the sieves are more mollified and stupefied and dead and cannot be extended nor strengthened, and when they constrain with lesions or punctures or needles and do not feel pain, then you know that it is not healed, and in the same disposition it is mortal.
And if it does that and feels constraint with lesions or punctures, then you know that the nut of the bone is saved and that the patient will recover with a cure.
And if you see the spine of the neck similar to that and you want to know if it will be healed or not, then consider its feet.
Then if you see that it is mollified, it succeeds in revealing to those who have fallen into the masses, and then when you sit upon the sick back, you feel windiness and evacuation of their will, and some veiled injuries are resurrected upon the sick back and want to urinate but cannot, then you know that it is mortal, and therefore do not struggle with its cure.
But if it does not succeed in revealing any cause of those, the cause is worse and more feverish.
And the cure of it is that you perform a sedation of the hot abscess that pauses over the atrited spine with rose oil sol, or with mugwort of Houssay's mixture; pause over that some veiled injuries during the day until the hot abscess is sedated.
And then pause one of the comforting and existent emplasters, and strengthen over that with a liament; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and not to sleep on the affected part where it hurts until it is healed.
And if it succeeds in giving the atrition of the satirical bones or some cause that has been separated from it, then it is necessary to succeed over the code and to remove that bone; and then adjust the two lips of the wound, with a suture if it is large; and then cure that with an encarnation of the enguentz, until it is healed.
But if the bone of the fingers is broken, and it is the end of the rib, then it is necessary that you insert the finger in the left hand in the back, and that you join the broken bone in the other hand according to what is possible for second equilibrium; and then pause over the emplaster and astelha, if you need those, and then strengthen that.
And if you feel broken satirical bones in it, then you finish over that, and remove that, and cure the wound with the cure that is preceding until it is healed.
Head chapter.
About the restoration of the narrow passage.
The bones of the narrow passages are so fractured, and if they are fractured, then the breakage is only communicated to the extremities of those and are inserted in the length and decline towards the internal parts; and it causes a bad pain in the place and puncture, and the leg is stunned when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over that entrance which is above the fracture, whose shape is that of it.
And if the fracture is in the extremity of it alone, then you straighten that according to how it appears to you by equalizing the entrance that it may be assembled to its natural figure.
But if the fracture is in the loin or already declines towards the lower parts, then you make the patient lie on their back with their belly exposed so that it may be prepared for your restoration of that fracture. And then when you have straightened it, place a plaster cast on it, and also place a splint of wood or of cane, and bind by stricture so that there is no point of fracture nor movement of the splint.
And fill the concavity with water so that it takes the shape according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their side.
But if there is a hot abscess, then cease the extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is settled, and place water on it that settles according to what has been said; and then return to its restoration, and bind thus with a cover.
And if they are in the affected bones or are communicated, then you treat them.
Chapter eleven.
About the restoration of the fracture of the helper.
The helper is that which is between the shoulder blade and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is fractured, then the restoration of it is in one of two manners, one of which is that you take a wooden plate instead of a thick groove according to this form.
And tie it with two extremities of two ligaments, and then it is suspended from the elevated place.
And follow the patient onto a seat; and then put the broken arm on the wood until it reaches the tip of it in the middle place where it is annexed to the curvature of the wood.
And then suspend it above some heavy cause or the minister extends it to the lower parts; and then the doctor says that the fracture is in its proper place, until the fracture returns according to what is convenient.
And the other manner is that the patient is resupinated on their back and suspends the hand of the neck with a ligament; and then command two ministers that one of them holds what is above the fracture in its proper place; and the other holds it below; and each of them extends to their part.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then bind above the fracture with a ligament and above that with another ligament, and each of the two ministers extends to their two parts.
And then if the fracture is near the extremity of the muscle, then it is convenient that half of the ligament be placed on the knot and the other below the fracture towards the shoulder blade.
And similarly if the fracture is near the shoulder blade, then it is convenient that the ligament be placed on that place and on that shoulder blade.
Fill that which is facilitated and its trouble, and then when it will be filled according to what is convenient and it is applied for good application, then bind that if there is no hot abscess.
But if there is a hot abscess, then loosen the stricture until the seventh day, and place on it a warm poultice wrapped in seven layers of oil and rose water until the abscess subsides, and then you bind that.
And the manner of binding that is to place a plaster cast on the fracture, and then place an envelopment of new cloth around the plaster cast; and then adjust the arm on that helper, and place its hand bent over the shoulder muscle.
And place the cloth and bind around the helper the arm so that the arm is in its proper place of stability, if it does not prohibit any cause of the broken bone.
And then use stability.
And it is that which places on the fracture that stability which is more firm and stronger than the other stabilities; and place between each stability the width of the finger, and let the length of the stabilites be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from the entire part.
And then bind around the stabilites with the stricture which was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your stricture on the place of the fracture should be tighter. And when the fracture is more elongated, the stricture should be less.
And then if you observe the situation of the stabilites and the stricture thus as we have said in the hour when you restore the member to its natural position, then you do.
And if you suspect an abscessed hip, then you will dissect the structure and the stars within the seventh day, as we have said before.
And then consider the ligament in all parts for three days so that it does not become inflamed or infected in the affected area; or it is forbidden to bring food to the member for fear of superfluous structuring; and thus rectify everything according to what we have said.
Perhaps you are confident that no cause of this will occur, then do not release the ligature until three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their right side, and their other side should be towards the stomach.
And pause on the cotton wool padding full of lanolin application, and consider at any hour of the night or day that the figure of the injured limb is not deformed or dissolved, or that the ligament is softened, thus rectify everything according to your true virtue.
And pause the food of the patient according to the order which we have given you, so that the food is subtle at the beginning until it begins to strengthen; and then cover that you thicken the food of theirs.
It is customary for the adjunct and their leg to be strengthened in 40 days; and then it is fitting that they are released and administered a bath, and thus medicated with unguents which rectify that.
And if the fracture is badly damaged, then you do not release the ligament and the stars within a day or within two months.
Chapter 12.
On the restoration of fractures of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two forearm-bones; of which one is small and it is the one that is called the radius, and the other is large and it is the one that is placed below the small radius, from the part below.
And it happens that the larger forearm-bone alone is broken, or the smaller one, and it happens that they are broken together.
And when the smaller forearm-bone is broken below, then its restoration is easier, and its healing is even easier.
And when the forearm-bone of it is broken above the fracture of it is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm-bone below, then it is convenient for the doctor to pause a little extension in order to facilitate the healing of that.
Perhaps if the larger forearm-bone is the one that is broken, then it is fitting to pause a more vigorous extension.
And if both forearm-bones are broken together, then it is fitting that you pause the strongest extraction.
And it is fitting that you pause the figure of the hand from the restoration of it and the extension of it extended on a cushion, and let the pulse of the hand be at the parts above, more than all the other fingers, and the auricular finger be lower than the other fingers, and the patient be seated on a wooden chair.
And let there be a cushion placed underneath it in its height or elevation, so that the patient does not incur trouble.
And then extend the minister's arm from the affected part downwards to the healthy hand or ligament, and another minister extends similarly from above.
And then the doctor reduces the bone into place so that it returns to its best figure as much as possible.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then you must forcibly reduce all the fragments into their place with your true virtue.
And if it appears in the separated splinter that holds the cord and does not hope for its restoration, then you finish over it and leave it according to the manner which we have said above.
Perhaps if the fracture is a plague, you have already done it at this singular chapter, and thus take the care of that.
And if you suspect an abscessed hip at the beginning of your restoration, then you line up a drap with cerate made of rosated oil and white wax, and it is better between specificity and subtlety, and strengthen the drap over that in a subtle structure until the abscess is calmed; and then remove the cerate and pause to apply a plaster prepared from powder of mulberry on a clear day, and then pause for stars; and let the star be the one that is paused over that fracture more gently and more strongly.
And you know that the number of stars on the arm is seen in the major dispositions, or it is a fracture in one forearm-bone or in both forearm-bones together.
And then pause your structure over the place of the fracture more strongly and more vigorously, and when perhaps it will be the extraction at the parts above the fracture or at the parts below it, pause the structure a little while more softly according to what precedes the remembrance of it at the beginning of the chapter.
And the draps that are enveloped over the fracture are very humid draps, and they are not hard nor harsh, and the faith in which it is strengthened is of its own proper middle way between subtle and gross, as we have recommended.
Examine the limb and its ligaments for several days. And if you find any cause for which correction is necessary, then proceed with the correction of the limb, and meanwhile prepare a warm compress to apply to the affected area until the correction takes effect.
And leave the limb unconstricted until it rests, and then return the structure to its normal state.
And if the extraction has been softened and the bone has been re-aligned and appears similar to the others, then rectify all that is yours in its virtue.
And consider that the nutrient is prohibited from reaching the limb due to an excess of structure, because meanwhile you soften it a little and leave it for several days until it can receive the nutrient, and then strengthen it.
Perhaps if the patient does not find any cause for those things that we have said, then it is not suitable to delay until about 20 days or around that time.
And then the hand of the patient should be suspended in its virtuous movement, and make it sleep on its back.
And you will know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or in 32 days, or perhaps it is restored in 28 days, and all that is according to the disposition of the complications and the dispositions of the virtue.
Chapter 13.
On the restoration of fractures of the finger and of the toes.
You will know that the fingers of the hand and the toes are prone to fracture, and they do not receive correction without very gentle and carefully considered movements.
And when there is a fracture or dislocation in the hand, then it is necessary for the patient to follow a straight and equal direction, and then place their hand on that extension.
And then the minister extends the broken bones and sets them in place, so that they are reunited with good conjunction.
And then it is necessary to apply an emplaster and a bandage, if you do not find an abscess or tumor; and then place a star-shaped dressing underneath according to the quantity of the location, and you have already enveloped that in a linen cloth.
Perhaps if the bandage is in the divided parts of the belly of the palm, and then make it resemble a spear of cloth, and command the patient to strengthen that with their wounded palm; then it will be strengthened with a long cloth.
And the star-shaped dressing of cloth in which it is elevated, so that the body can be applied to the palm; and strengthen that according to what is necessary.
Perhaps if the fracture is in the forepart, then it is necessary to place a star-shaped dressing underneath and another on the part below in the palm, so that the hand can be uplifted and straightened; and then place the structure, thus revolving the hand to its natural position among the fingers.
And if you find a fracture at the knuckle of the toes, then if it is the toe that is affected, it should be set according to what is necessary and then strengthened in the palm, and if you want, place a small, straightened bandage around it so that the fracture is elevated and not dislocated.
Perhaps if the fracture is in the other toes, thus as in that of the middle place, or in the index finger, or in the ear, or in the ring finger, then it should be set and tied to the toe itself; or all the ties are according to continuity, and it is better; or place on top of a small star-shaped dressing, thus as we have said for the toes.
And consider, in your restoration, and then that, the disposition of abscess or tumor and opposite — in the surgical operation — in what is necessary when you find any cause among those, according to which the narration of it is repeated.
Chapter 14.
On the restoration of fractures of the bone in the hip.
The bone of the hip is very fragile and is declared to the sentiment according to which it is converted to the part above and to the upper layer.
And the restoration of it is done in such a way that the ligament is strengthened over the fracture and another ligament below the fracture, and the patient is prostrate on their back and on their face.
And then the minister extends all the ligaments to their part according to the quality, when the fracture is in the middle place of the bone.
Perhaps if it is proposed to the root of the hip, then the ligament is proposed to the dentate at the part of the pelvis, so that the extension remains in its place, and the other ligament below the fracture.
And similarly if the break is proposed to the dentate, then it should be made into a ligament proposed to the dentate, and the extension should be to the parts below.
And then the doctor sets the bone in place with both its natural joints so that it is reduced according to its natural semblance and the bone is joined by good conjunction; then it is necessary to apply an emplaster and a bandage, if you do not find an abscess or tumor in the limb. More frequently, it happens in the aposteme (abscess), then you leave it like that for several days until the abscess is drained, and then return to your care.
The treatment of it is done thus: cover the fracture with a hard bandage, and double or triple wrap it, and remove the superfluous part; and then cover the leg up to the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long filament between the thigh and the leg near the knee, and guide the extremities of the filament to the affected parts below, and then wrap it around the leg and thigh so that it does not slip out of the bandage.
And then stop on the thigh at the place of that fracture thus, and stop one star-shaped bandage over the bone of the leg.
And then fill in the empty spaces between the leg and the thigh with many folds, so that the extricated structure is consolidated.
And then begin a strong treatment on the middle of the affected part with three or four wraps, and as you feel yourself getting better in the alignment of the fracture, your treatment will be less and lighter and more gentle.
And then extend the two extremities of the filament to the affected parts below until they reach the heel of the foot, and strengthen both extremities of the star-shaped bandages on the other part so that the alignment is not removed from its place.
And then leave the treatment on that, so that it does not cause corrosion to the member nor abscess nor inflammation and similar things; and if any of these causes occur, then cut off the defective part, and correct what has been done wrongly, according to what we have said many times.
More often, it happens in the bone where the pain is, then cover what you have wounded according to your ability; and if not, put a dressing on it and leave it, and cure what preceded the memory until it is healed.
And several times it is strengthened, this fracture of the thigh and other things that are adjusted to the star-shaped bandages, thus as we have said in the adjunct and in the arm.
More often in the restoration of it, thus is done so that it does not cause limping to the patient; and if it is restored alone, or another thing that must be applied to the other leg, then it is necessary that it be limped from what was before.
And you know that the thigh is strengthened in 10 days or a few months, and all this is according to the diversity of the complications and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
On the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap of the knee.
You know that a fracture of the kneecap of the knee is difficult to heal, it more often causes many troubles.
More often it happens to the fracture, then it is not just a crack or break in its parts, and that is a plague or several plagues, and about that all has been said with the sentiment.
And the restoration of it is thus, that it is grafted with what has been broken from its parts, to be joined together as much as possible through equilibrium and facilitation and fabrication.
And then stop the plastering and stop on that round star-shaped bandage, if it is needed for that; and strengthen underneath with a suitable treatment.
And then consider all the dispositions that we have recommended for other fractures, thus as abscess and similar things to those in which it is opposed to all accidents with what is convenient for it to be healed.
Chapter 16.
On the restoration of the fracture of the leg.
You know that in the leg there are two bones, one of which is large, and it is named by the name of the leg; and the other is subtle, and it is named fibula.
And it happens to some species of fracture that it happens to the two bones of the arm, and for this reason the restoration of it is done thus as the restoration of the arm by grafting, and the operation of it is one.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is converted into all its parts.
And if the thin bone is broken, the leg is converted into the lower parts.
And if the large bone is broken, it affects those below, and it is one of those causes that are not easily amended.
And then administer extension and equilibrium and ligamentation of the stars according to that grafting.
More often, it happens that if the fracture of the leg is old and has many complications, the extension should be less and lighter, and it alleviates your virtue.
And in the leg there is some cause of operation on the arm, and it is when you graft the star-shaped bandages and complete all the tie-up operation, then you take measures of wood or pine which are placed below the causes that were placed alone, and make a support of palm branches; remove those from the ones that are small and fragile, and not be heavy on the handles, and let them be the length of those according to the length of the leg, and of the knee up to the foot.
And then envelop each drap in two enveloping bandages according to the length of it, and place one on the top of the leg on one side and the other on the bottom of the foot.
And then bind the two stilhes in three places on the extremities and at the middle location, because with this structure the leg is prohibited from bending to the right and left sides, and it remains in good position.
And then administer a wooden splint according to the length of the leg; and it is placed on the leg so that it conserves its movement.
And especially be careful that you do not make a fracture, and when you have that plague properly.
And then consider each day the leg and study it for further study, and you will guard against aposteme and inflammation or other similar causes; and when any of those causes occur, then you will pause to examine what is happening inside so that it may be healed.
Chapter 17.
On the fracture of the ankle and bones of the foot and toes.
The ankle does not often suffer a complete fracture; rather the bones of the foot sometimes suffer fragmented fractures; and the toes of the foot rarely suffer fractures, and they do not occur unless there is an awkward disposition.
And if the bones of the foot suffer a fracture and sometimes those bones are elevated above each other, then the patient pauses to place their foot on the ground prepared in this way as an aid.
And then pause to place one foot on what is elevated by those bones, and then calcify them, and press, and bandage them so that they return to their places.
And then apply a plaster and stop above, and place underneath the belly of the foot a small table to which are attached two flat plates.
And then strengthen that around the foot in a descending structure, because you have enveloped that with drapes and other causes among which it is indicated.
And when three or four days have passed, then you will release the binding, because you will find the bones reunited, or reset, or relocated, and the operation on them is thus successfully concluded.
But if some toes are reset, then restore them, and bandage them thus as I have instructed you in the restoration of the toes of the hand. And then place the reset toe stilhes according to the length of the toe, and it is placed a little apart from one another; and then place underneath the foot this table that I have recommended to you, and strengthen that around the structure descending.
But if what is reset of the bones is two or three or more, then you place over each toe stilhes according to its quantity enveloped in a lion's drap, and strengthen the table at the bottom of the foot, and stand on one of the plates of the table above the belly of the foot so that it holds with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you do not forget to consider all the causes which I have told you in the other fractures of accidents that we have mentioned; and pause to examine every accident so that you may know what is happening inside.
Chapter 18.
On the fracture of the knee of the woman and of the bone of the penis and of the wound of the man.
When the knee of the woman is broken, then make her sit on a chair, and bend it towards the back of the two little ones, and hold it behind.
And then the matron supports the knee from behind, and does it to the knee of hers just as I have spoken; and then the woman is consoled, and raises the back of her little one little by little, because all that is forgotten returns until it is in front of the knee just as I have spoken and the broken bone returns.
And then place poultices on the back of hers, and when she wants to urinate, remove the behind of her to facilitate it, and reduce and return that according to the manner according to which you began at the beginning, and then return to the first poultice.
And do it thus for seven days or around those, because that is restored.
And if you wish, take once a small tube of cane and strengthen it over the thigh of hers with a reed of cane; and insert the whole bladder into her knee, and then inflate through the tube until the bladder is inflated inside the knee, because the fracture returns.
And then it is filled from behind and stays for several days according to what we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the penis of the man or woman is broken, then administer in the restoration and adjustment of it what we have recommended for the bone of the hip.
And that which is straight is not hidden in these fractures, and little happens, mainly to those who are somewhat studious and use and understand my free book; because that fracture indicates to you in the major dispositions via direct methods in the restoration and structure of it, and therefore understand well.
When the man is afflicted in the groin area because of being wounded, take a poultice of water, and place it on that area; then pause over the wrapped dressing, and let it be enveloped, and then leave it like that for three days or around that time, and he will be healed.
Chapter 19.
On the restoration of fractures of bones when they are badly bruised.
It is convenient for the one to whom a fracture occurs badly bruised, and more so if the bone is large, like the bone of the hip or of the joints, or similar to that, that you take care and fleubotomize as much as possible, according to the conditions of fleubotomy that are suitable for you or testify as we have said above.
And if the bruise flows with blood, then it is necessary that you take care of its retention in such a way that you powders above the injured place, if no other cause is present.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not prolong it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if an abscess occurs cautiously, then you delay the restoration of it until the sixth day, until the abscess is discharged, and do not approach it on the third day or the fourth, because you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the uncovered cartilage, then it is necessary that you perforate to reduce it and enclose it with your fingers as much as possible and with little extension.
But if the extension is not prepared by your fingers as much as possible, then you reduce it with your fingers as much as possible to this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight digits and the width of which is according to the quantity of the bruise; and for that reason it is necessary for the doctor to take account of these three or four according to the quantity that is indicated by him in the treatment of every kind of fracture.
And it should be rounded, and it should be in a small groove so that it is not doubled over itself during the operation hour.
And it should be of acute extremity to which the margin is in the six extremities; and it should be below it with a thick tendon, tending from the middle towards the divided parts.
And this is its shape:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", thus it is a small spatula.
Because it is necessary that the extremity of the acute elevated part be paused above the extremity of the prominent bone.
And press it in a gentle way until the bone returns, and it is enclosed with some equilibrium.
And then it is necessary to enclose the extremities of the fracture among them, and if the extremity of the broken bone is subtle, and you do not take that instrument for good acceptance, then it is necessary that you insert the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone in every way that we have recommended, then insert it in a way that is suitable for the instruments which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever manner it may be possible for you.
And then scrape off what remains on the bone of roughness and of small, tender scars.
And when the bone is reduced, and then the reduction brings great pain to the patient, vehemently, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and therefore do that which you confer with the patient for great comfort.
When you have completed the restoration which you do to the bone, and then submerge it in a sixth steeping of black vinegar, and properly if it is in summer, and do not pause over the bruise or any other cause in which there is oil, so that it does not become putrid and corrupt.
And then administer stelas at the hour of the completion of the restoration of the bone, and leave the uncovered bruise in such a way that you insert the bandage with forceps and uses of envelopings according to the quantity of the bruise.
And beware that you do not strengthen the bruise on the fracture, because many vain efforts are made by foolish doctors, and they cause death or corrupting mortality, or sudden death, so it is sanity. And if the structure of the tissue is loose, soft, different from the structure of other fractures.
And if the bruise is great or is a bad bruise, and you fear those bad accidents which we have recommended, and it brings pain to the place, then it is not necessary that you pause over those stelas, but rather do that enveloping of harsh dressings in place of stelas and strengthen it with those.
And when one or two days have passed since the bruise began, which has generated a swelling, then you remove from below the dressing which you had placed over it for six days, and then administer cooling remedies, entreating them as we are accustomed to medicate bruises, thus entreating tetrafarmacon and similar to that.
It is convenient for you to dissolve the ligament and consider the plague in every morning and evening until it becomes consolidated and firm, and see that the member is prepared in such a way that the pus can flow from it to the affected parts easily.
If the plague does not pass in many days, and it is not consolidated nor has it receded from the arm, then you know that here are stagnations of the humors because the plague attempts to inquire into the plague with tension. And from those stagnations, those that are separated remain and are extracted, those that are not separated and put the member in a state of pain, therefore try to incise those according to what is possible for you.
And if you find the plague is acidic or ulcerous, it is stubborn, or another species of corruption and putrefaction, then you know that one of those has been paused which is convenient for him from the cure of which a preceding narration is made in the seventh chapter.
And of that which you know stays in the worst sermon and you make present your effort: when the bone is crushed, emollients are placed over the member just like the bones of the thigh and of the helper, and it seems similar to those of the large members, and do not assume attraction from it, nor the extraction of it because four motive veins have been opened for that which causes death; holding back there that enters, because the strong vein perishes if you delay for 20 days or more. And then cure the plague if you have seen it, and if there is not that one.
Chapter 20.
On the cure of nodes that occur in the signs of some fracture.
Many opened nodes occur in the signs of healing of fracture, and mostly because they are close to the joints, and it is ordered by the figure of the member; and strongly prohibits the member from its natural operation.
Then consider if the node is recent and administer in those medicines that have been stipulated, such as aloen, enses, mira, sercacollo, acrassia, and similar to those; also take some or all of those, and combine them, either stipated, or album of Huou, or agreed, and place it on the node in a stop, and constrict them over it for good consolidation.
And let the extrication not dissolve for many days; and then extract it and iterate another, until the node is removed; or strengthen over that layer of lead decently, because lead has the property of removing all that which is inflamed in the members.
Maybe the node is already converted into stone and strengthened, and it is necessary to provoke an ostensible contradiction, and then scatter it for the superior part above it, and incise the superfluity and eminence, or root out that with some remedies until it is removed; and cure that until it is sanctified.
Chapter 21.
On the restoration of fracture when it is restored and then returns the subtle member to its natural freedom according to its own nature.
When a fracture of the bone is restored, and then returns the subtle member to its natural freedom, then it is not done except for many causes: of which one is multitude of solution of the ligament and of the bonding not according to what is known; or for superfluity of structure of the ligaments until the nourishment is prohibited from flowing to the member; or for multitude of superfluous embrocation; or for superfluous movement not in its hour; or for lack of health in the body of the patient and for debilitation of it.
And the cure of that is to give nourishment to the patient and make their heart tender until the health is multiplied in them; and administer bathing; and apply gypsum and lettuce over them.
And then pause the poultice over the member, so that the poultice attracts to it much nourishment, or continues to embrocate with water and tepid warmth, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural figure.
Chapter 22.
On the cure of crushed bones when they are restored tortuously and prohibit the operation of their own that is known.
When it occurs to the member already restored with the healing of its own tortuousness and eminence to the crushed bone and node, and it is for that fed in the form of the member, maybe empowers the member not to be prohibited from its natural operation, then you do not know that you receive the word of one who existed, that member was newly crushed.
Maybe there are many foolish doctors and restorers who have done that in our land; and this operation is very detestable, producing great fear of the sign which is mortal.
Maybe the paralysis and node are recent, then you know that they are embrocated with tepid warmth in which they take mollifying herbs, just like they are fuels of altea and radish of it, and mellilot, and similar to those; and it is done with an emplaster of mollifying emplastering just like Dyallaquilon has done well; or that it takes mucilage of radish of altea and is continued in gray of gualina or oil of cirami, and is emplastered there; or that they take figs grasses and are treated with fems of colom, and similar to those of the medicines that are named Americans consolidation.
Some remedies are dissolved in a steady friction oil that is among the most humid, and it should be administered with gentle movements of the entire limb at all hours.
Perhaps it is twisted and has gone downwards and is made strong and converted into stone and provoked the need for iron therapy, then it is necessary to cover that which has settled above the affected area and the continuity of the bones is dissolved, and it is incised so that what flows from the nodes of those limbs is superfluous, and it is facilitated in that solvent which is stimulated and studied.
Chapter 23.
On ulcers and dislocations.
Dislocation is a displacement of some of the joints in their proper place, so that it is prohibited from movement, and the shape of the limb is altered, and it brings upon the patient great pains and large lesions.
Therefore when accidents happen due to a dislocation, then it is necessary to perform reduction as soon as possible, and not delay that reduction, because if it is delayed, the place becomes apostemated and very strong, which makes the reduction of the dislocation difficult.
And for this reason it is not necessary to massage or stretch at the time of apostema, because many vigorous movements bring about spasms and pains.
Perhaps when it happens, then it is necessary to apply yourself to the flaccidity of the patient, and then it is laid still so that the apostema relapses; and then the limb is wrapped in hot water and oil, and then it is reduced with ease.
And the entire limb is treated with the water of which the memory will come back to its place.
And now I have ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what has been preceded in fracture; from the upper part of the body down to the lower part.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jawbone.
So the two jawbones are dislocated if they do not close; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are removed from their places with little movement, and are softened a little; or they are completely dislocated and complicated, until they are softened at the joint so that corrosive saliva from the patient flows out and cannot hold it nor clear its mouth, and the patient's tongue is enveloped in its speech.
Perhaps when the dislocation of it is slight, then in major arrangements it returns by itself for a slight cause.
Perhaps if the dislocation is complete and complicated, then it is necessary to administer reduction of it promptly, and not delayed at all.
And it is that the minister holds the head of the patient, and meanwhile places their finger on the root of the dislocation of the lower jawbone inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or they place both fingers simultaneously, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers are placed above them which are engaged; and commands the patient to stop moving their jaws and releases those from any part; and the minister carefully places the jawbone and wraps it so that it returns to its proper place.
And if the reduction of it is difficult, and especially if both jawbones are simultaneously dislocated, then administer evaporation with hot water and oil, so that the reduction of both is made easier and does not delay the reduction of both at all, thus as we have said.
And thus when they are returned and so wrapped, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then pause on those pillows of drapery with cerote, and it is made of wax and oil rosated; and then it is tied with ease in a gentle manner.
And the patient should sleep on their back, and their head should be positioned between two aurelhes, so that they do not incline to the right or left side; and do not force them to chew anything for a long time; having the healthy diet forbidden, until when the pains are removed and the jawbones are numb, then it is allowed to eat what they want.
And this should be administered with ease, and do not trouble about the perception of the mouth, unless eating and drinking and citation, until the jawbone is numb and healed.
And if the reduction of both jawbones is difficult when they are dislocated at any hour and not converted to their proper places, then many vigorous movements happen with fevers and steady soda, and strongly it affects the patient's stomach, and strongly it vomits pure cholera.
And when you see this, then you will know that it is pernicious; and many vigorous deaths occur to the one who suffers from this in ten days.
Chapter 25.
On the reduction of dislocation of the ankle and of the extremity of the muscle.
The ankle is not dislocated from the foot because of its continuity with the foot; and some vigorous movements are dislocated at the front part, and this is declared by sensation.
And the restoration of it is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. Then place your hand on the area in your palm with strong pressure, because it will return there.
Then put a pause on that plaster and powders and strengthen it.
May the extremity of one who has seized the hip and is continued in it, not be dislocated on any day; then it is necessary that it be reduced and bandaged according to what we have said and according to your appliance.
And then put a pause on that plaster, and powders, and extract, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until they are healed.
And in this medical treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its proper place.
Chapter 26.
On the reduction of muscle dislocation.
You know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the top to the bottom.
And the second is that it is dislocated above the muscle, and that is done sharply; and it is not dislocated behind by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated below by the nerves.
And mostly it is dislocated and therefore exits at the bottom parts of the thigh, and mostly in those where the flesh is thin, it is easily dislocated; but in those where the flesh is thick, it is exited with difficulty.
And often accidents happen to some men through percussion or fall, and the muscle of it is affected by a hot abscess, and it is bruised because it has already been dislocated.
Then it is necessary that you spread it out so that you are above-mentioned about it, and then you proceed with its cure.
And it is recognized the dislocation of it when it is at the bottom parts of the thigh; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the sound one, because you find among them manifest diversity; and you find in the head of the concave muscle and below the thigh, from the touch of the head of the muscle as if it were a hollow, and the patient cannot reduce his hand to its proper place, nor can he move at all.
If it is dislocated from the foot or above, and then you find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
And of this dislocation, a gentle reduction is made when it is fresh and the patient is in a favorable condition.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises his hand to the upper parts; and then he pauses with the toes placed below the thigh, and raises the joint strongly in its proper place, and the minister raises his hand, and extends it there; and then he pauses because it returns gently.
But if it does not return for what we have said, and so from the beginning that the dislocation occurs, many days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and be administered an embrocation that softens and soothes, as if it were a poultice of altea, and fenugrec, and melillot in water, and be administered.
And then the patient should be placed on his back and paused below the thigh, expecting that it will be bandaged between relaxation and constriction, and then the doctor pauses with the hand on the spine, and raises the head of the muscle to its proper place, and releases the hand of the patient so that it is not hidden at the bottom parts, and another minister holds the head of the patient, so that it is not hidden at the bottom parts, because it returns quickly to its proper place.
And if you want, reduce it in this manner: and it is that you make a present to a man who has been longer than the patient, and he is on the side of that bed, and he places his hand below the thigh of the patient and raises the thigh of it to the upper parts until the patient is suspended in air, and another minister pulls the hand of the patient from the bottom parts of the back. But if the patient is weak, then it is necessary that another cause be suspended, so that they help him, because the dislocation returns quickly.
And it is reduced in this way: and it is that it is fixed on the ground a long stick with a rounded figure, like a mortar pestle, which is not large nor subtle, and then it is paused below the patient; because it is paused over the head of the stick, the patient stands according to the length of the stick, and then his hand is extended to the bottom parts of the other side; and his body is extended from the other side with strength, because the joint returns to its proper place quickly.
And if it is difficult to reduce it for all the causes that we have mentioned, then use this cure: and it is that you take a stick of the quantity of which is in the length of two arms, and its width is of four fingers, and its thickness is alleviated on the surface of the thigh according to this form.
And place above the red cap a sheet of lions' skin, so that it does not touch the patient's body.
And place the patient's little finger, and extend your hand or arm within between the divided parts, and tie the patient's body to the helpers and arms and extremities of the hand.
Place your arm on a step of a ladder according to the latitude, and the hand is extended to the divided parts below, and the other thing is suspended from the other side, so that the joint intra is stabilized.
And when the instrument is complete according to whatever manner is possible for you, and then cover that you apply below the little finger a quantity of wool soaked in a mixture of powdered moly and album of water over all the muscle, so that it is revolved from above, and place a strengthening bandage below the little finger with decent structure; and the ligament is revolved over the bandage, and the hand is attached to its neck, and be quiet, and do not move the hand for seven days.
And cover that the food of the patient is paused for a little while, until the member is comforted, because it is easier to attend to his health.
And then the food is given in greater quantity around seven or eight, and an exercise of movement is made; and therefore if it is strengthened and not softened, then it is already healthy.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity that affects it or for another cause, then it is necessary that a cautery be administered there in three tracts, as it has been said in the chapter on cauteries.
And if all this is done and seven days are spent loosening the ligament and the joint is not strengthened, and the bandage and structure are reduced on many occasions, and it is not strengthened and cannot be elevated to the above parts, then you will know that the nerves of it, which are at the head of the muscle, are already injured or extended or softened, and you will know that the joint at no time will be fixed in its place.
Regarding the dislocation of that which is done from the feet and thigh or the back parts, the reduction is made with impulse and extension in the hands, until it returns to its place.
And another structure is administered there, and care is taken until it is healed.
And if it affects the health of the member and slowness in its movement, then the patient uses many baths until that gravity is alleviated and returns to its natural state.
Chapter 27.
On the cure of dislocation of the hip.
You know that the joint of the hip is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all parts, especially from the front to the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it falls below the vein or below the ligament according to some figure being dislocated, and when you adjust the dislocated hip in the sauce, this is declared manifestly to you, because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor touch that high muscle.
And you know that the hips, and reduce the dislocation as soon as possible before it reaches a chronic apostemation, because if it reaches a chronic apostemation, difficult is its reduction, and hardly is it healed at all; especially when it is in the back parts, because worse is it than all other species of dislocations, and of greater pain, and many times it leads to death.
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that its hand is extended with two fingers, and its arm is expanded, and the fingers of the thigh are above the hip and below it, and the bandage wraps the joint with the toes of its own fingers, or at the base of its palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front parts, then it returns also by bending the hand with its own hand, until it strikes the hip at the base of its palm.
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then administer vehement extension and very strong force.
And it is necessary that two ministers extend the arm, and hold that extremity with two ministers so that it is not removed from the extension.
And then the arm is revolved from all parts, because it is enveloped in a doubled cloth bandage over its hand, or ligament.
And when the thigh touches the joint with its hand, until that oil is applied for so that those causes which help in lubricating the joint are facilitated; and then the joint is strongly bandaged until it returns to its place.
And then the reduction of it is seen to be placed on that bandage in which it is stipulated and exception is made with album of water, and is strengthened with decent structure, and the arm is suspended from its neck, and is left for some days.
And then release it; and so if the joint is formed in that place, then you release the ligament of it and let it be like that.
If you see the joint is not strengthening, then you iterate the plaster and ligament, and let it be like that for several days until it is externalized; and then release it.
Maybe you should add gravity to the reduction of the joint, and its disposition is in movement, then administer humidity in baths and subtle friction, and compress, until it is alleviated; or pause on the joint alleviated, so it is a motor of great strength; and then release it, and let it be like that over the bone day and night. And then remove that, and put it in baths; and when it sweats, then you rub the joint with tempered friction, and then iterate over that alleviated, so it is rotational of motor, one time, and the second, and the third. in immersion of baths, until it is relaxed.
And if you wish, pause on that humid and scaling wound with border and strengthen over that; and do some several times, because it is humid and reduces to its disposition.
Chapter 28.
On the cure of dislocation of a bruised limb, so it is of the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
A bruised hand sometimes gets dislocated, and the reduction of its dislocation is easier, and conversely it is with other joints, but maybe especially because velocity is needed in the reduction of it at the hour when it is dislocated, provided that the place is apostematized or that it falls into an apostematic posture.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the joint of the hand of the patient on a table and the doctor extends the hand of that, and places his hand or his palm over the proximity of the joint, and presses until it returns to its own place.
Maybe especially because it is considered if the palm has been opposed to the belly of the hand, then the patient places the back of their hand on a table for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is precedent over the back of the hand, then let the position of the hand of that be inherently on the table, so that the doctor's hand fits over that proximity of the joint.
And then it returns soon, good is; and if not, then strengthen that with an embrocation cedant the apostema and let it be like that; and do not iterate that, because if not, no suffering nor no pressure on the reduction of it, since it will pass in a few days.
Maybe the Roman joint is according to its tortuousness; and do not note to the patient any cause, but rather that the hand is mollified and cannot strengthen any cause; then you know that the nerves are pinched or compressed, and then it is not engendered in it except that it is strengthened with a pointed cautery for the sake of its improvement and fortifies that which confers some cause.
Then when the bruise is returned, then pause on the embrocation which we have recommended, and let it be like that for five days; and then release it and let it be like that, and the hand of it should be exercised.
Maybe if the movement of it is stopped and falls into some gravity, then you lift that with warm water and some friction several times, until it is alleviated.
Chapter 29.
On the cure of dislocation of the toes.
Some times they dislocate the toes completely apart.
And when a toe is dislocated from among those to the back of the palm or to the belly of it, then stretch the toe and press the dislocation of it with the tied poultices, until it returns.
And then sustain the head of the toe, and suspend that from the part where it is dislocated, and let it be like that for two days.
And then suspend that and extend that until it is straightened in its own day.
And when it is night, lay it according to that narration, and do not cease to release it in the day and exercise with movement, and lay it at night; and do that for several days until it is straight.
And do similarly to that, if it is dislocated to the belly of the hand, and lay it at that part and do that in the first operation, until it is healed.
And similarly do that when it is dislocated to other parts.
Chapter 30.
On the cure of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When it falls to one of the vertebrae of the back or neck, a complete dislocation, and so many vertebrae are removed from their places, then in that case there is no cure, because death comes quickly to the patient.
And it is said that the evacuation of the patient is out of his will, and cannot retain that; and many times they mollify some members of it or two joints of it or two arms of it, or one of those; or a vertebra is removed from its place, because many times it is removed and many times it is done, making the removal of that into four parts.
Therefore, it has already been shown in the previous parts and named gelbozitation.
Maybe the cure of it is that sometimes they consider if the gelbozitation comes from poverty, because sometimes in that there is no cure nor salvation for all.
Maybe in that which is seen through percussion or similar to those, the Ancients already described the manners of cure in a prolix sermon, from which the most returns to profit; maybe you have already experienced relief from that for which little excuse is needed, due to the proximity to the intended meaning, in which they have exposed and formed diverse instruments, with which I will show and explain it.
And of those it is not cured except the one that comes from the back properly, in that which you have recommended.
And it is that the patient should be extended on their face towards a wall near a partition, and should be extended under the instrument much in order to not hurt their feet.
And then a straight stake should be placed, fixed in the ground at the end of the wall around the patient's head, and another stake in the air holding their feet on the other side of the wall.
And the minister holds the stake, and it should not be fixed in a ditch; and another minister holds the other according to that form.
And then wrap around the patient's head and tie the bandages firmly; extend the extremity of the bandage to the stake which holds the patient's head, and tie it there; and then strengthen the other bandage on their hips, and tie their legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other stake which holds their feet.
And then the minister should carefully extend the bandage to the part of the stake, and do not disturb the two stakes and the bandages from their proper places where they are fixed, maybe afterwards it will not be firm as we have said.
And the doctor puts his palms on the spine with strength until it returns, or he puts them on that one table, and then adjusts the patient's feet on the table until they return.
Maybe if it does not return by this method, then take a table of which the width or length is in the air of three arms, and carve on the wall where we have said that it is near the patient a place where the extremity of the table enters. And then place the flat surface of the table on the spine, and the doctor places their feet on the other extremity, and stretches it until the spine is straightened and returns to its proper place.
And if you want, take it to the place which is revolving in the hand; and it is that you fix on the ground near the patient's head at the back of the wall two stakes, the length of which is one arm, and near the patient's head at the back of the wall also two stakes; and let the length be between each stake a palm, and already it is made in each stake a hole in which the rope will turn, and each should be firmly fixed on the ground so that it does not move.
And let there be a round stake in which the rope turns, and it revolves in the two holes of the two stakes.
And at the extremity of it there is a hole in which the stake is formed, the length of which is one palm where it revolves; and on the two other stakes it is similar to that.
And then strengthen the bandages that are stretched on the patient's feet at the hole which holds their head, and the bandages that are stretched on their thighs at the rope which holds their feet.
And then there should be a rope and a minister who turns the rope with his hand, and the doctor straightens the spine according to what we have said.
And then since the spine is returned, and the place is straightened, then cover that you apply an excruciating plaster of albumen on the patient's back, and then stop; and then put it on the plaster like a table of which the width is three fingers or around that, and its length is as much as takes the place of the gout, and on the part of the spine.
And then let it be bound with the bandage that we have said, and use subtle nourishment to heal the patient until they are healthy.
And if there remains any weakness in the place at the end of the healing, then take care that medicines are administered which mollify and soothe, and administer them on the table for a long time, which we have recommended; and already it is administered in that place a thin layer of lead.
And some weakened joints come to prominence at the back of the spine of the two, and it is suitable for that dislocation; and it is that bone which already warns you so that you do not try to make a premature recovery with this medicine, because it will strongly harm your attempt to act mortally.
Chapter 21.
On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
You should know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the muscle do not only dislocate, but also slip out of place, and do not receive those things that they receive from the other small joints with movement and concavity.
And the ankle joint is dislocated in four ways, either it is dislocated backwards, or forwards, or downwards, or upwards.
And mostly it is dislocated backwards, and rarely forwards or downwards.
And the sign of dislocation of it backwards is that, when you adjust the leg of the healthy person with the affected leg, it is longer and more prominent than the healthy one, and the affected leg cannot bend its knee joint, and it is the place where the knee joint is swollen with a warm apostema, so that the head of the thigh bone has arrived here.
And the sign of that which receives a forward dislocation is that the accidents of it are contrary to this accident.
And the sign of that which receives a downward dislocation is that the leg expands according to its natural tendency, but it cannot bend because of the pain in the knee, and if you force it to move and it cannot go upwards; and its urine is retained and its knee joint is swollen, and its walking is difficult on the ankle.
And the sign of that which receives an upward dislocation is that it does not expand the knee, nor can it bend forward, and its leg is shorter than the other, and the knee joint is softened, and the head of the thigh bone is in a different place.
Moreover, the reduction of the species of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and chronic, that it has already become accustomed to having that part, you will administer reduction of it according to its disposition, then it is not in complete cure; and therefore it does not seem suitable for a prompt recovery.
Moreover, in that case where the dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four species of dislocation, then you will find that you need to return the joint and extend it backwards and forwards, and move it to the right and left, so that it returns to its strength and does not require another cure.
Moreover, if it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a stronger minister and extend the leg from the affected part downwards, or with its own masses, or with the ligament which is tied above the knee; and another minister extends the hand of that one upwards so that it meets its own masses below the nipple; and you strengthen the ligament on the head of the thigh bone, and hold another minister to straighten the extremity of the ligament.
And its extension is from the ankle to the knee joint at the part of the hip, or from the back to the part of the spine.
And its extension is all of those in a single direction until the affected limb is elevated above the level of the ground and remains suspended.
And this species of extension is common to all four.
And so if the dislocation returns to what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for all species that we speak of regarding proper cure.
In the reduction of its own, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is backwards, it is necessary that the affected limb be resupinated above the level of the lateral thigh; and then pause the ligaments on the head of the thigh bone in that place between the head of the thigh bone and the knee joint below; and then extend the ligament from the part of the knee joint to the most distant part of the hip.
And then another strong minister takes hold of its arms, and embraces the large area of the affected thigh bone and extends to the forward parts by vigorous extension, so that it returns to its original place.
And this species is of the easiest cure, in which this member is reduced more easily than the other species.
Moreover, if it is exempt from you and does not obey the entrance into this species of cure, then it is necessary that the two feet of the affected person be tied together firmly, lightly, above both ankles and both knees.
And its length is equal to the quantity of four fingers, and the affected leg is extended more than the other by a quantity of two fingers.
And then the affected limb is suspended above the head of the stick, and it is in a balance; and its length from the ground is a quantity of two arms.
And then command a strong youth to pull the head of the thigh bone, and it is suspended with the affected limb another youth, and the other youth pulls the thigh bone in strength with rapid impulses, so that the joint returns to its original place with velocity.
In the reduction proper, when there is dislocation in the affected part beforehand, it happens that the patient's joint adjusts according to how we have recommended to set the limb; and strengthen the ligament over the affected leg properly and over their chest.
And place two pillows, one under their feet, and the other at the head; and place adjusted pillows to support the middle of the affected limb over which the humors are enveloped, so that the patient is not bothered by the pillow being between their thighs, so that the extension to the affected parts is not hindered.
And each minister extends to their own part, and the doctor has his hand engaged in the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the anterior parts, then it happens that the leg is extended lightly, and it is according to this narrative method about the affected limb; and the doctor places the palm of his right hand on the affected groin, and then contracts that with his other hand, and in that contraction he pauses the extension to the affected parts downwards to the part of the thigh.
And if the dislocation is in the posterior parts, then it does not happen that the affected limb is extended to the affected parts downwards, and it is elevated above the ground; however, it happens that it is placed on a hard surface, thus as it happens with the reduction if their ankle is dislocated beforehand, according to what we have said about its placement on two anchors; and it is above its face and the ligaments are extended, according to what we have said, there is no danger.
And it happens that an administered compression bandage is placed on the area where the joint is located.
Then, since the reduction is completed as it happens — and the sign of the reduction of it is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend both legs of the affected limb, and when you see those joints and the affected limb stretches out the healthy leg and expands its excuse, then you know that the member has returned as it happens — and then you adjust both thighs and place a bandage around them so that the ankle is not hidden in any of the parts; and adhere the affected limb to rest for three days or four.
And then release the ligament and the bandage, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see those joints in their proper place, then you know that the dislocation is already fixed, and thus the affected limb can walk again.
And if you see any cause of softening, then you return and plaster it, and stretch it according to its first structure, and thus it will be in three days.
And then release it, and make it delay in walking about for some days, until it is comforted.
Chapter 32.
On the cure of dislocation of the thigh.
The thigh is dislocated in three ways, because it is dislocated to the anterior parts, and to the posterior parts, and sometimes to the upper parts and sometimes to the lower parts; and to the anterior parts it is not dislocated.
And the sign of dislocation of it is that you command the affected limb to apply its leg to the thigh; then you know that the thigh is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its ways is that you make the affected limb straight, thus that it extends the healthy leg, if possible; tie two towels to the face of it, and place its foot between the two towels; and then make adhere the thigh of it with your two palms, and hold them together with the two towels on the thigh of it in strength, and another minister extends the healthy foot until the thigh returns to its place.
And the sign of reduction of it is that its leg adheres to the thigh without labor or effort.
And then plaster it and make the leg adhere to the thigh, and then bind those together with a bandage for three days or four, and then release them.
And do not use the affected limb for walking for some days, until it is healed and comforted.
It happens that if the reduction of it to you is excused, then administer strong extension to the ligaments which are in the cure of the preceding narrative about the ankle.
Chapter 33.
On the cure of dislocation of the ankle.
Some ankle joints are removed by small movement, and some joints are dislocated according to completeness, and the dislocation of it is made either in the posterior parts or in the anterior parts.
And the sign of the dislocation of it is that you see the ankle swollen proceeding to the part where it is dislocated.
The healing of the patient's dislocation is often a long process, and it is necessary to extend and facilitate the hands so that they can be restored inward.
Sometimes in the healing of one who is dislocated according to a compliment, it happens that you make the patient straight, and hold that strong and valiant minister behind the back of that person in the middle place.
And then you put your right hand on the straight foot above the ankle, and your left hand below the foot at the place of the calf.
And then you draw the foot to your right hand, and then with your left hand for two fingers, and then extend your left hand; and you press the toes of the foot against the leg, just above the knee.
And make two fingers according to what we have counted.
And then you press the toes of the foot against the leg at the third finger, and you are at the calf.
So if it returns to one finger or two according to this method, and if you can straighten the foot, it's good; and if not, then repeat the operation, because that will return.
Sometimes if you are prohibited from reducing it with what we have recommended, then make the patient sit on their back on the ground, and stretch a strong bandage tightly around them, and enclose it between the thighs of the patient, and you have already enveloped them in a sheet so that they do not move.
And then the minister holds their thighs, and another minister extends the foot with their hands or wraps it around the neck of the foot; and then extend that same minister against the extension of the back, and the bandage is extended between the thighs of the patient, holding it, so that the body of the patient is not attracted to the lower parts below its extension.
And then the doctor straightens the dislocation with his hands, and another minister holds the healthy thigh at the lower parts, because the dislocation returns to its facility.
And so when the dislocation returns and it is declared to you the healthiness of the reduction of it, then pause the plaster and stretch that strongly with a bandage, and bind the foot to the leg.
And beware that you do not touch or guard the nerves which are behind the ankle, so that the bandage on it is not violent and holds it firmly.
And then leave it like that for two days or three; and if the bandage is softened, stretch it out.
And then remove it on the third day or fourth, and prohibit the patient from moving for forty days. Sometimes if you are forced to delay in that space, it is not done securely so that the dislocation does not dissolve and corrupt, and then that which does not receive cure.
And if you happen to find the apostema cautious, then beware that you administer in the sedation of it, which our narrative has preceded, in another place of cure and of embracement, until it is restored.
Chapter 34.
On the Healing of Dislocation of the Toes of the Feet.
It happens that one who is dislocated can be straightened with little extension of their efforts; and that which is not difficult, therefore it is easier.
Sometimes if the dislocation is in some nodes of the foot, then beware that you make the patient sit on their back on a flat surface or on a table, and it should be still like that as if it were normal.
And then you stand on feet, and pause the foot on what you imagine to be the joints, and then calcify that in the foot as it turns until it returns, and you see that it is already straightened and does not appear in the eminent place.
And then pause below the belly of the foot on a table that holds the whole foot, which has two cups, and then strengthen it in a decent structure and hold it firm for three days; and then remove it and make it rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and its recovery is assured.
Chapter 35.
On the Species of Dislocation that are Made by Wound or Fracture or any other Accidents.
When you encounter some cause of those, and you fail in the cure of that and in the restoration of it, many fingers succeed in death.
And for that you do not know that about the cure of it, except he who is wise in the art, from long usage, merciful and pitiful, slow, not hasty nor presumptuous; and who uses in the commencement of medicines that cast out apostemes so much alone, and leaves the patient to divine judgment, but hopes for salvation from perdition, with alleviation of the malady, and in which appears some hope. And then it is necessary to proceed so much from the reduction in the commencement of the cause, because it will encounter a cautious aposteme.
And then if the limb returns according to what we will, then administer a regimen that casts out cautious aposteme and cures the wound with what is convenient for it from the dry desiccations.
And if a dislocation is caused by a fracture and separation of the sacrum bone, then you perforate the statement of theirs, and do so in such a way that it has been said in simple gout cases that it precedes in those locations.
And beware and avoid according to your virtue that of the instrument in the ways of fear according to what has preceded my predication; for it is better for you to give thanks to your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more greetings to your body very truly at that time. Thus the paragraphs of Albucasim are perfectly filled with those which God may bless. Amen.
