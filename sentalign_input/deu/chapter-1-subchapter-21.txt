Chapter Twenty-One:
On the Cauterization for Tooth Pain.
When tooth pain is caused by cold, frost, or worms, and treatment with medicine is ineffective, cauterization can be done in two ways: with cow's butter or with fire.
Cauterization with butter involves boiling cow's butter in an iron ladle, wrapping cotton around the end of a stick, dipping it in the boiled butter, and quickly placing it on the painful tooth until it cools.
Repeat this several times until the heat penetrates the root of the tooth.
If you prefer, soak wool or cotton in the butter, place it on the painful tooth, and apply a hot iron on top until the heat reaches the base of the tooth cavity.
However, cauterization with fire involves using a brass or iron cannula with some thickness to ensure the heat does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, apply it to the tooth, and hold it until it cools; repeat this a few times as needed to relieve the pain, either the same day or the next day.
The patient should fill their mouth with good butter, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out. This is the form of the cautery.
Use whichever extremity you find most suitable for cauterization.
This is the form of the cannula:
