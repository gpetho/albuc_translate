Of a fracture with a wound.
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that it be healed immediately, as the cures that we have described demonstrate.
And if the wound heals, staunch it with vitriol if you have nothing else, then begin to restore the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if no hot abscess develops.
And if a hot abscess develops, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a bad outcome.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the exposed flesh, you must set it gently with your hands, with slight extension.
And if the extensions are not prepared for you to apply with your hands, then set it with this instrument which is made of iron, which is seven or eight fingers long, and the width is according to the size of the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for the physician to have three or four, depending on what is needed in each fracture treatment; and let it be round and a little thick, so that it does not bend under the compression on the limb during your work, and let it be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called a "lever," for which it is necessary that the curved head be placed on the head of the exposed bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and they are even with one another.
And if the fracture is fine, and the instrument cannot grip the bone well, then you must cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument can have a hold.
And if you cannot reset the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument for this, either an incisor or a saw, as you are able; then smooth what remains of the bone's roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
So work until it is in its place, then wet a cloth in dark, astringent wine, and especially if it is in summer; and do not put on the wound cerate or anything else with oil, lest it cause pus and corruption; then apply splints when you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted with the fracture; and many times foolish physicians have done this, and have caused the patient to die or sometimes suffer a corrosive infection; and let the bandaging be softer and gentler than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that a bad outcome may occur, as we have said, and you find pain in the area, then you should not apply splints; but wrap around, instead of splints, hard cloths, and tie them.
And when you see after a day or two swelling appear at the wound, then remove what you have put on it completely with wine, and apply a wound-healing ointment, such as tetrapharmacum ointment and similar ones.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and healthy.
And the limb must be positioned in such a way that the swelling drains downwards easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but continues to swell, know that there are small pieces of bone, for which you must explore the wound with a probe, and remove all these separated pieces that cause this pain.
And if a fistula arises there, or another kind of infection, then you must treat it, according to what it says in its chapter before.
And when the bone is broken, and exposed on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and other similar large limbs, do not pull it, because many times death comes from it, but leave it until it rots; perhaps it will fall off by itself after 20 days or 30, then treat the wound, if you can; and if you cannot, leave it.
