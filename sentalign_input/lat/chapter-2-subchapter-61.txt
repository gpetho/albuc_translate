On the extraction of the stone in women.
Chapter 61.
A stone rarely forms in women.
But if one of them develops a stone, the treatment is difficult and is hindered for several reasons.
One of these is that the woman may be a virgin.
The second is that you may not find a woman willing to expose herself to a doctor if she is chaste or married.
The third is that you may not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially in manual procedures.
And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone, which requires a deep incision, and this carries risks.
If necessity calls for it, then you should find a female doctor who is skilled, though such are rare.
If you cannot find her, then seek a chaste, skilled doctor, and bring along a midwife well-versed in women's matters, or a woman familiar with this part of the art; make her present and instruct her to follow all your directions in examining the stone.
First, she should determine if the woman is a virgin: if so, she must insert her finger into the anus and search for the stone.
If she finds it, she should press it beneath her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patientâ€™s vulva and examine the stone, after placing her left hand over the bladder and applying firm pressure.
If she finds the stone, she should then gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downward with all her strength, until it reaches the base of the thigh.
Then make an incision over it at the midpoint of the vulva near the base of the thigh, on whichever side it is positioned and where she feels the stone: her finger should not move from the stone, pressing under it, and the initial incision should be small.
Then she should insert the probe into that incision.
If she feels the stone, then enlarge the incision by a proportionate amount so that the stone can pass through it.
And know that there are many types of stones.
Among them are small and large, smooth and rough, long, and round ones with branches.
Therefore, know its type, so that you are better informed on what to expect.
If bleeding overwhelms you, then apply powdered zegi to the area, and hold it there for an hour until the bleeding stops.
Then return to your operation until the stone is extracted: and make sure you have with you the instruments I mentioned for extracting stones in men, so they may aid you in your operation.
But if bleeding overcomes you and you know that the bleeding is from a severed artery, then apply powder to the area, compress it with pads of appropriate tightness, and do not change it: and leave the stone alone, do not extract it.
For the sick woman might die.
Then treat the wound.
When the intensity of the bleeding subsides after a few days, and the area has softened, then return to your operation until the stone exits.
