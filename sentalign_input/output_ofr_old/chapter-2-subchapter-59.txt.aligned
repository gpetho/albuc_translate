When abrasions or blood occur in the bladder, or decay is present, and you want to distill water and medicines there, do so with the instrument called "clepsydra," and this is its form:	When there occurs an ulcer in the bladder, or there is a clot of blood or a deposit of pus in it, and you wish to instil into it lotions and medicaments, this is done with the help of an instrument called a syringe.	0.7393314
It is closed, and has three holes: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see; and the place at the top where the medicine flows should be such that it stops the penis without addition, so that the moisture can be drawn out, and pushed in when needed;	It is made of silver or ivory, hollow, with a long fine tube, fine as a probe; entirely hollow except for the end, which is solid with three holes in it: two on one side and one on the other, as you see. The hollow part containing the plunger is exactly of a size to be closed by it, so that any liquid is drawn up with it when you pull it up; and when you press it down it is driven in a jet, as is done by the projector whereby naphtha is thrown in naval battles.	0.6779491
and when you want to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the kesteur in the moisture, and pull the plunger that is inside; this will draw the moisture into the kesteur, and then push the plunger back in forcefully; the moisture will enter, and come to the bladder immediately, so the patient will feel it;	So when you wish to inject fluid into the bladder, dip the end of the syringe into the fluid and draw up the piston, for the fluid will be drawn up into the cavity of the syringe. Then introduce the end into the urethra as we described for catheterization; then expel the fluid by means of the piston; the fluid will immediately flow into the bladder and the patient will have a sense of its entry.	0.79048026
and this is the form of the fine clyster with which one irrigates the bladder: it is here:	This is the illustration of a fine clyster also for irrigation of the bladder.	0.57632476
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle, and pierce it roundly around; then put a strong thread through these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put into it what you want of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument; and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.	But if you have not a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and cut out a circle; then make holes in the edge all round the circle; then pass a strong ligature through these holes all round and draw the circle in, as a bag is closed with a draw-string, first putting into it whatever fluid, oil, or water, you desire. Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as with the camel's bladder, squeezing until the fluid reaches the bladder of the patient.	0.8838745
