Treatment of swelling that appears on the eyelids.
Sometimes, something appears on the eyelids that resembles hailstones in its hardness and strength, and thus is called "hailstone."
It is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper and lower eyelid.
So the procedure is to examine if the swelling is moving across the eyelid and its cause is minor.
Then make a lateral incision, and easily scrape it from all sides until it escapes, then lift it with a hook and remove it.
But if the incision is not enough, gradually make deeper incisions without causing any harm.
If the swelling is large, then stitch it and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there will be no harm as the ointment will restore and heal it.
If the swelling moves inward towards the inner surface of the eyelid, then evert the eyelid, lift the swelling with a hook, and press it from all sides. If the eyelid is elongated by the incision, it causes no harm.
After the incision, wash the eye with saltwater and treat the wound with something that promotes healing until it is cured.
