On the cauterization of abscesses.	On cauterization of the kidneys.	0.7603686
When abscesses cause pain due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's suffering is worsened, then you should cauterize the abscesses with a nail-like cautery, as previously mentioned.	When pain strikes the kidneys from chill or heavy vapour, and the patient's sexual vigour is impaired thereby, you should burn him right over the kidneys, once on each kidney, with the claviform cautery mentioned before.	0.6086581
Then quickly cauterize them a little below, resulting in three lined-up cauterizations, which will be more effective.	I have often burnt him with a third cauterization on the flat of the back, making three cauterizations in a line, which is most effective.	0.59234715
