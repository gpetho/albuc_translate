Chapter ninety-four on removing arrows.
Arrows may differ according to their types and according to the places in which they are located in the body.
As for their differences according to their types, there are large ones and small ones, and there are hollow glass ones and solid glass ones, and some have three corners and four corners, and some have tongues and some have splinters.
As for those that are according to the organs in which they are located, they are of two types: either the organs are from the main hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like.
When an arrow falls into one of these organs and the signs of death which I describe to you later appear, then it is necessary to avoid removing that arrow from it, for death befalls its owner in most cases.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not hidden in the depth of the organ, then remove it and treat the wound.
And of the signs of the brain, if an arrow hits it and penetrates the bone and wounds the peritoneum which is on the brain, then there results from that a severe headache, nausea, dizziness, redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting, and sometimes blood comes out of the nostrils or ears, and sometimes speech is cut off and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling porridge comes out of the place of the wound and a liquid like the water of the flesh flows from it.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not come out.
As for the signs of the arrow if it hits the heart and is close to the left breast and feels as if it has been driven into something solid and not into something empty, and perhaps the arrow has a movement resembling the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and this is followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting, then know that death is certainly coming.
And a sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels which are next to the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes, and he breathes heavily and asks to inhale cold air.
If the arrow hits the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it is close to the small ribs, and the breathing is great with severe pain and sighing, and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow hits the liver, severe pain follows, and blood comes out of the wound which resembles the liver in its redness.
And if the arrow hits the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food comes out of the wound, and the matter is clear.
And if the arrow hits the abdomen and is stuck in it and something from the stool, or the fat, or an intestine which has been perforated comes out of the wound, then there is no hope in treating it or in removing the arrow.
If the arrow is in the bladder and the urine comes out and something protrudes from it to the outside and the pain intensifies on the patient, then know that he is doomed.
As for the other organs, like the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, thigh, leg, and the like of the organs, they are usually saved when the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I tell you some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may deduce from that your treatment.
That is, an arrow had hit a man in the corner of his eye at the root of the nose, so I removed it for him from the other side under the lobe of the ear, and he healed and no harm occurred in his eye.
And I removed another arrow for a Jew that had struck him in the lobe of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had hidden, and I only reached the small end that adheres to the wood, and it was a large arrow from the arrows of the compound bow, square iron, smooth, and there were no barbs on it, so the Jew healed and no bad incident occurred in his eye.
And I removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was an Arabian one, which is the one that has two barbs, so I made an incision on him between the jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat, so I gently handled it until I removed it, and the Christian was saved and healed.
And I removed another arrow from a man who had been hit in his abdomen, and we estimated that he would die from it, but when he remained for thirty days or so and nothing changed in his condition, I made an incision on the arrow and maneuvered it and removed it, and he healed and no bad incident occurred.
And I saw a man who had been hit by an arrow in his back, and the wound healed over him, but when it was after seven years the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman who had been hit by an arrow in her abdomen, and the wound healed and the arrow remained, and nothing changed in her condition, nor did she feel any harm from it in any of her natural actions.
And I saw another man who had been hit by an arrow in his face, and the wound healed and he felt little pain from it.
And many are like this.
And I removed an arrow from a man, one of the Sultan's eunuchs, which had hit him in the middle of his nose, slightly leaning to the right side, and the whole arrow was gone. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow had struck. I found the wound of the arrow very narrow, so I examined it with a thin probe but I did not feel it.  He felt a stinging pain under his ear from the right side, so I hoped that this stinging was from the end of the arrow, so I bandaged the place with a bandage that had pulling and ripening power, hoping that the place would swell and the sign of the arrow would appear, so I would make an incision on it. But no incident occurred in the place indicating that the arrow had reached that place, so I continued with the bandage for many days, and no incident occurred, so the wound closed during that time, and the patient remained hopeless of removing it for a period, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose, so he told me the news, so I put a strong caustic medicine on the wound for many days until it opened, and I probed it, and I felt the thin end of the arrow that sticks to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until the end of the arrow appeared to us visibly, and it went on for about four months. Then when the wound widened and I could insert the forceps into it, I pulled it and moved it but it did not respond to coming out, so I continued to gently handle it and maneuver it with types of instruments until one day I grasped it with tight forceps, as its image will come in the end of the chapter, until I removed it. Then I set the wound, and the doctors judged that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I set it and the wound healed and the patient healed completely, nothing hurting him at all.
And I tell you how to remove some arrows so that you make that a measure and a guide to what I have not mentioned, because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description nor can a book encompass them, but rather the skillful craftsman measures by the little on the much and by what is present on what is absent, and he infers a new work and a new instrument when strange incidents descend from this craft.
So I say that arrows are removed from the organs in which they are stuck in two ways: either by pulling from the place from which it entered, or from the opposite direction.
And those which come out from where they entered, either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, so it is pulled and removed. If it does not respond to coming out at the time it fell, then it is necessary for you to leave it for days until the flesh around it rots so that it is easy to pull and remove it.
Similarly, if it is stuck in a bone and does not respond to coming out, then also leave it for days and return to pulling and moving it every day, then it will come out.
If it does not respond to coming out after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill until you widen it for the arrow, then pull it and remove it.
If the arrow which is stuck in the bone of the head has gone deep into one of the ventricles of the brain and some of those symptoms which I mentioned to you appear from the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until its matter clears up after days, for if the arrow has reached the peritoneum, then death will not delay it.
And if the arrow is only stuck in the body of the bone and has not extended to the peritoneum, and the patient remains for days and nothing of those symptoms happens to him, then endeavor to pull the arrow and remove it.
If it is very stuck and does not respond to pulling, then use the drills around the arrow as I described to you, then treat the place until it heals.
As for if the arrow has hidden in a place in the body and is hidden from feeling, then examine it with a probe. If you feel it, then pull it with some instruments that are suitable for pulling it. If you cannot do it because of the narrowness of the wound and the distance of the arrow in the depth and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then make an incision on it until the wound widens and you are able to reach the arrow until you remove it.
If it has two barbs, grasp them, then free the flesh stuck in them from every side with every trick you can do that, and endeavor, if you cannot free the flesh, to break the barbs and twist them until you are free.
And when you try to remove the arrow in whatever place it may be, then use the twisting of your hand with the forceps to all sides until you free it, and be extremely gentle lest the arrow break and it be difficult for you to pull and remove it.
If you cannot do it at your time, then leave it for days until those fleshes around it rot, then return to it, for it will be easy then. If bleeding obstructs you, then use what we mentioned of treatment in its chapter.
And guard yourself from cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use a trick in every way you can free the arrow, and let that be gently, slowly, and steadily as I described to you.
And it is necessary for you, when you pull the arrow, to put the patient in the shape he was in when the arrow struck, for that is more suitable. If you cannot do that, then use whatever shapes you can.
As for the arrow which comes out from the opposite direction, either something of it has protruded to the outside, or you find the end of the arrow by feeling from above the skin near and see it protruding, so make an incision on it, and let the incision be to the extent that the forceps can fit in it, then pull it, for it is easy to come out.
If it sticks in a bone, then twist your hand in a circle until the arrow affects the bone and widens for itself, then pull it. Otherwise, leave it for days, then return to it until it comes out.
If the shaft of the arrow is in it, then push it with it. If the shaft has fallen and you want to use pushing, then insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the tail of the arrow, then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, then push it with an instrument that enters that cavity, for the arrow is easily removed by that.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut away all the flesh that has become poisoned in it, if you can do that, then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow is in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is close to what can be felt with the probe and you can make an incision on it, then make an incision and guard yourself from cutting a vein or nerve and remove it, then stitch the wound if it needs stitching, then treat it until it heals.
The image of the forceps with which arrows are pulled:
Its ends are like the beak of a bird, made as if it were a file; if it grips an arrow or something, it will not let it go.
And various types of it are made, large, small, and medium, all according to the size of the arrow, its smallness, the width of the wound, and its narrowness.

Image of the solid midfagh:
This is solid at the end, like the probe, to facilitate its entry into the hollow arrow and pushing it.
