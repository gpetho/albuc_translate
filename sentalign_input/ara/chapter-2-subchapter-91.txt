Chapter Ninety-One.
On the Excision of a Varicose Vein.
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, barren countries of little fertility, and sometimes it develops in other places of the body besides the legs, and it is generated by putrefaction that occurs under the skin.
Just as it occurs inside living bodies, worms, pumpkin rot, and worms generated between the skin and flesh. And the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the place swells up, then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that swelling.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal, so when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one dirham to two, and tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
And whenever something comes out of it, you wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut off some of it and wrap the rest, and do not cut it off from its root before it all comes out, because if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, so it causes swelling and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be managed and pulled little by little until it comes out completely and nothing of it remains in the body. And from this vein in some people may come out what is five or ten spans in length.
And I have heard that it came out of a man twenty spans. If it breaks for you while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole and pack it with a long packing along with the body until all the matter in it is emptied, and try to purify the place with medications for days.
Then treat it with the treatment for swellings. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or in the leg itself, so it develops many openings, and a branch emerges from each opening, so treat it as we mentioned in the division and with what preceded.
