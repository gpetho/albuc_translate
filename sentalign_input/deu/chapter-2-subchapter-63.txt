Chapter 63.
On the section about fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the section on this hernia, there is fear leading to ruin in major cases; therefore, I find that abandoning it and being saved from it is better.
I am recalling the operation on it and the types of swellings.
I say that the swellings occur in bodies whose genitals are affected and this happens for many reasons: either by an acute sour excess, which is poured into the genitals, or by a blow.
The color of the swelling matches the body color, and it is not painful, but it is a serious swelling.
Often the swelling becomes stone-like, its color is dark, and it has no sensation.
Sometimes it occurs by blockage of the arteries, and by swelling of them as has already been mentioned, or by swelling of veins.
What is caused by swelling of arteries is known by the dispersal of the swelling when you press it with your fingers; it should not be touched.
What is caused by swelling of veins is not dispersed at all by compression with fingers.
It is possible to make an incision on this type and on other fleshy parts; you must cut the genital covering, extend the testicle to the upper parts, remove it from the white sac, free the suspensory cord from the vessels, tie them, and cut the suspensory cord as you free it from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is consolidated with those fleshy parts, you must remove and cut it.
If there is adhesion to any part of the sac, or to the vessels, you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
If there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, you must cut all of it and remove the testicle as we have said.
When your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
