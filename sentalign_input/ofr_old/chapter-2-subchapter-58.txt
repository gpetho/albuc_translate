of the retention of the urine
The retention of urine is caused by the obstruction of a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or flesh growth, or similar things that we have mentioned in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should bend over his knees; and place his feet on his back, and stretch his belly over his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is forced to expel the stone, thus releasing the urine;
and if it does not come out as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called "syringe," which has this form: it is made of fine silver, light, and shaped like a bird's feather; and the tube is a palm and a half in length, and fine at the tip.
The method of releasing the urine is to take a double thread, and tie a bit of wool or cotton at the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe; and cut the excess wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then coat the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a chair, and moisten his bladder and penis with olive oil and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the base of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the abdomen; then push the syringe forward until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it reach the empty space, and this is done in this order only because the passage where it goes is twisted; then gradually pull out the thread with the wool, and the urine follows the wool, then remove it, and let the urine flow;
and repeat the syringe process until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
