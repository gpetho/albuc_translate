On the method of cauterizing corns and warts.
Chapter 55.
This condition often affects the lower parts of the feet and consists of thick, hardened growths that harm the foot.
There are two methods for treating them: cauterization with fire or with hot water.
For fire cauterization, use a hollow cautery resembling a vulture's feather, made of iron, and sized to fit around the corn on all sides, with fine edges.
Then place the heated cautery over the corn.
Rotate the cautery around the corn, allowing it to penetrate deeply; leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus.
Then apply a poultice of wild mallow crushed with salt and leave it on overnight.
This will cause it to be uprooted from its roots.
Afterward, treat the area with an ointment that encourages flesh growth until it heals.
If the corns or warts are not recessed and occur on the body’s surface, particularly on the hands and feet, then apply cauterization with hot water. Use a metal tube made of bronze, iron, or a vulture’s feather, and place it over the corn or wart.
Pour a small amount of hot water into the tube, press it down and turn it slightly so that the tube’s edge presses into the root of the corn, allowing the hot water to reach the corn’s depth. Let the patient bear the hot water’s sensation for about an hour.
Afterward, release it, as the corn will be uprooted from its roots.
Proceed in this way, one by one, until you treat all the corns on the body.
Then, once removed, treat the areas with an ointment that promotes flesh growth.
