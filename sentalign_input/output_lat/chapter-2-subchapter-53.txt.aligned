We have already discussed the types of cancer, and the way to treat it with medicines: and caution is required in its treatment with the knife, to prevent ulceration: and we spoke of cancer arising in the womb, and the caution in its treatment.	We have spoken, in the relevant section, of the kinds of cancer and of the way in which medical treatment of them is to be attempted; with a warning against treatment by the knife lest they ulcerate. We also mentioned the cancer arising in the uterus and gave a warning against its treatment.	0.84640956
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is located in a place where it is possible to remove it, as in cancer of the breasts, or the thigh, and similar areas, from parts that allow its complete extraction: especially when it is small in its early stages.	The Ancients said that when a cancer is in a site where total eradication is possible, such as a cancer of the breast or of the thigh, and in similar parts where complete removal is possible, and especially when in the early stage and small, (then surgery was to be tried).	0.8107251

And the procedure, when it is situated as we mentioned, is to first cleanse the patient several times of black bile. Then perform bloodletting on him if you find him obviously full.

Then apply hooks to the cancer that suit it. Afterward, hollow it out from every part along with the skin, according to examination, until nothing of its roots remains: and allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it off quickly; rather, press the places and wipe away all thick blood by hand, or with any possible instrument.	Then attach to the tumour hooks suited to it; then make a circular incision all round to include the skin with the utmost thoroughness so that not the least root of it remains; let the blood flow and do not stanch it quickly; but put pressure upon the place and squeeze out all the thick blood, either by hand or with any instrument you can.	0.8730066
But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein causes you trouble, then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops. Then treat it with the remaining remedies, until it heals.	If in operating you get a very severe haemorrhage from cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops; then dress in the usual way until healed.	0.75357103
