of abscesses of the throat Sometimes lumps come inside the throat, which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the section, and they are not healed, then take note: if it is a hard abscess with little feeling and dark color, do not touch it with iron (a surgical instrument).	On the treatment of swelling of the tonsils and other swellings in the throat. Sometimes there occur in the throat buboes called 'tonsils', which resemble the buboes occurring externally. When you have employed the remedies described in their own place, without effect, examine, and if the tumour be hard, dark coloured, and devoid of sensation, do not touch it with an instrument.	0.67710173
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the bleeding; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will rupture by itself; and if it is a round white color, and the root is thin, have the instrument prepared for cutting, but first see if the hot abscess rests and is calmed.	If it be of a red colour, with a thick root, do not touch this with an instrument either, for fear of a haemorrhage; but let it be till it come to a head; then you may perforate it or let it burst of its own accord. But if it be pale coloured, round, with a slender pedicle, this is the kind that should be cut. The operation for this is first to see, before operating, whether his inflamed tumour has already completely subsided or to some extent diminished.	0.80354106
Then have the patient sit facing the sun, with his head in your lap, and open his mouth and have the assistant hold it between his hands, and press the tongue down with the instrument, of which here is the form; and let it be of silver or fine brass like a knife:	Then make the patient sit down in the full light of the sun with his head in your lap; open his mouth; and have an assistant before you to press back the tongue with an instrument like this.

When you press down the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out as much as you can; and pull some of the tissues with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which here is the form, which resembles scissors; however, the tips are curved, and one towards the other, and are very sharp, and it is made of Indian steel or fine steel:	And when the tongue is depressed with its help, the tumour will be made manifest to you and your direct vision will fall upon it. Then take a hook and fix it in one tonsil and pull it forward as far as it will go; but be careful to not pull away with it any of the mucosa. Then cut it with an instrument of this form; it is like scissors except that its extremities are curved, the beak of each meeting the other, and very sharp. It should be made of Indian iron or Damascene steel.	0.84772694
And if you do not have this instrument at hand, then cut it with pliers, of which here is the form:	If you have not this kind of instrument, cut it with a scalpel of this form, on the one side sharp, on the other quite blunt.	0.5859771
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had grown inside her throat, that is to say, an abscess with little feeling; and it had almost completely closed off her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and she could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained like that for a day or two.	I once treated a woman for a tumour that had grown in her throat and was rather dark in colour and had little sensation. It had almost blocked the throat and the woman had only a narrow opening to breathe through, and was quite prevented from eating or drinking, so that she was at death's door, if she had so remained for a day or two.	0.8176984
And the abscess had risen so much that it had pushed out two lines through the two nostrils.	From the tumour there arose two offshoots, which had eventually emerged through the nostrils.	0.53909266
