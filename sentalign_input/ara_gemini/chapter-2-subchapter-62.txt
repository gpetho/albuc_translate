Chapter sixty-two on incising the watery vein.
Hydrocele is the collection of moisture in the white membrane that is under the skin of the testicles surrounding the testicle, which is called the scrotum, and it may be in a special membrane prepared for it by nature on one side of the testicle, so that one might think it is another testicle, and it may be between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane that we mentioned, and this only occurs rarely.
This hydrocele arises from a weakness that affects the testicles, so this substance flows to it, and it may result from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture is of many colors, either yellowish, or bloody red, or turbid black, or watery white, which is the most common.
The signs by which the collection of water is known are that if it is in the white membrane that we mentioned, the swelling will be slightly elongated and round, like the shape of a testicle, and the testicle will not appear because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in a special membrane for it, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle, and for this reason, one might imagine it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, it will be perceptible by touch.
And if you want to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose picture has been presented, and whatever comes out after the probe, you will judge it by what is inside it.
So, if we proceed to treatment with iron, you should order the patient to be bled, if he is able to do so and you see that his body is full, then he should lie on his back on something slightly elevated, and you should place many rags under him, then you should sit on his left and order a servant to sit on his right, stretching his penis to one side of the skin of the testicles and towards the flank, then you take a wide scalpel and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise to near the pubis, making the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the skin of the testicles in half until it reaches the containing white membrane, then you peel it off, being careful not to cut it, and your peeling of it should be from the side that is more attached to the testicle, and you should complete the peeling as much as you can.
Then you pad the water-filled membrane with wide padding and remove all the water.
Then you separate the edges of the incision with hooks and stretch the membrane upwards, and do not touch the containing skin of the testicle, and you cut the membrane however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece, especially its thin side, because if you do not complete its cutting, you cannot be sure that the water will not return.
If the testicle protrudes out of its skin during your work, when you have finished cutting the membrane, put it back, then bring together the edges of the skin of the testicle with sutures, then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals.
If you find that the testicle has been corrupted by another disease, you should tie the vessels that are in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have mentioned.
If the collected water is on both sides, know that they are two hydroceles, so cut the other side as you did on the first, and if it is possible for you to perform the operation as one, then do so.
Then you wipe the blood and insert wool dipped in oil or rose oil into the incisions, and put other wool dipped in syrup and oil on the outside and spread it over the testicles and the flank, and place folded rags over it, which are the compresses, and tie them from above with the bandage that has six ends, in this way:
Then two pieces of cloth are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with carded wool according to this example.
And the ends with which it is tied are made of cotton or moist wool.
And they are gathered by tightening in the waistband of the trousers.
And one of the ends is taken on the buttocks to the back.
And the second is taken towards the pubis.
And the two ends are on the thighs from below.
And the two remaining ends are on the groins.
And all the tightening is gathered in the waistband of the trousers.
And this bandage may also be made by cauterization instead of incising with iron.
Which is that you take a fine knife-shaped cautery and incise with it the skin of the testicles while it is hot, as we have described, until the white membrane containing the water is exposed.
Then take another cautery of this shape:
And it resembles the Greek eye,
then you cauterize with it that peritoneum while it is hot until all the moisture comes out,
then you stretch the peritoneum with hooks and peel off the containing layer with the cautery iron and cut it as much as you can until you completely eradicate it and be careful with the testicle, do not touch it with the fire,
and know that this procedure is safer and further from bleeding and better than the incision procedure,
if you encounter during the incision or during cauterization a hot swelling or bleeding or something else, then you should treat whatever you encounter of that with the appropriate treatment as mentioned before,
if the patient is cowardly and does not have patience for this procedure because of its ugliness, then let him use the lancing as I will describe it,
and if it is confirmed for you by the evidence we presented that the hydrocele is watery, then you should sit the patient on a high chair,
then lance the swelling at its bottom with a wide scalpel and make the lancing along the body and let the opening be wide so that all the water flows out,
then put cotton on the area and bandage it and leave it to absorb the remaining water,
then treat it until the wound heals,
if the exit of the water is difficult during your lancing of it, and that is only because the white membrane obstructs the mouth of the wound and prevents the exit of the water,
then you should insert into the wound a goose feather or the instrument with which the water of lovers is extracted, whose image has been presented before, or increase the opening of the wound a little,
and know that the water may return and collect after six months or so,
so if it collects, lance it in the same manner, and the patient should endure his days.
