of worms that are born between skin and flesh
This disease is called in our land "ox disease," because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm that arises between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the whole body ascending and descending, and one feels it well as it moves from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and jumps out;
and it is generated from the corruption of certain humors, as worms and snakes and earthworms and ascarides arise in the belly;
and one fears its malice, for when it travels through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, perhaps it enters and destroys the eye;
and this happens many times.
When you wish to treat it and extract it, you can only do so when it moves:
therefore, you must tie the area above and below with a strong ligature very tightly, then cut into it and pull it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it, cauterize it with fire on top, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does is that it infects the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, squeeze the eyebrow tightly below it, then cut into it and pull it out;
and the patient must use body cleansing with laxative medicines for the bad putrid humors, and abstain from foods generating rot.
