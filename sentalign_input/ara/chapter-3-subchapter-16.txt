Chapter Sixteen.
On the Treatment of Leg Fractures.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the two bones of the arm.
Therefore, its treatment is the same as the treatment of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are broken, the leg will be twisted in all directions. If the thinner bone is broken, the leg will be twisted forward.  If the thicker bone is broken and this occurs in the lower part, it will be obvious to you.
So use extension and alignment, and apply splints accordingly in the same manner, except that if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, the extension should be less and lighter, and you should be very gentle in treating it.
There is one additional procedure for the leg compared to the arm: when you have aligned the splints and finished all your work, take two thin strips of pine wood, the kind used for smoothing the ceilings which are placed between the cracks in the boards, or they can be made of palm leaf ribs or similar material.
Choose those that have a little thickness and are not too thin, and let their length be the length of the leg from the knee down. Then wrap a cloth around each one twice lengthwise and place one on the inner side of the leg and the other on the outer side.
Let them extend from the knee to below the foot. Then tie the two strips together in three places: at the two ends and in the middle. By this binding, the leg is prevented from tilting right or left and is well supported.  A wooden trough along the length of the leg may also be used.
The leg is placed in it to keep it from moving, and this is especially necessary if the fracture is accompanied by a wound. Then check the leg every day and take great care of it regarding swelling, inflammation, or any other such issue.
Whenever any of these occur, treat them appropriately until healing is complete.  The leg bone heals in thirty days or so.
