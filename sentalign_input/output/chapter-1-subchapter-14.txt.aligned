When treatment for nasal fetor as previously mentioned in the division proves ineffective, prepare and administer purgative pills for three nights. Then shave the patient's head and cauterize with an olive-shaped cautery. Next, cauterize with a nail-shaped cautery on both eyebrows just below the hairline.	When you have treated foetor by those methods given in its section and your treatment is unsuccessful, give the patient laxative draughts for three days; then shave his head; and burn with a median cauterization with the olivary cautery; then cauterize him twice above the eyebrows a little below the hair with a claviform cautery.	0.79670376
