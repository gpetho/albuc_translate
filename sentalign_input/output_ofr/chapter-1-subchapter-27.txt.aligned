And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with the lancet, if you are skilled and wise in the art, and be careful not to burn the entire core, because you would dry out the whole body; and do not let it come to a boil, for the core is very delicate there, and know this for certain.	You will also be able to do these cauterizations with the edged cautery when you have craft and facility in the art. Be careful lest you go too deep with the cautery and burn the whole thickness of the skin and the abdomen and penetrate to the intestine, for the skin there is thin; bear this in mind.	0.7406163
