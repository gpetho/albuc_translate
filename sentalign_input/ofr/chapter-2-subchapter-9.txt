of hail
Often there appear in the eyelids things that resemble hail in their form and hardness, and for this reason this disease is called "hailstone", and it is a collection of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below;
the procedure is as follows:
observe if the hailstone moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to determine;
then make a wide incision, then peel it gently from each side, then grasp it with tweezers, and cut it out.
if you cannot cut it out without piercing the eyelid a little, it does not harm the patient;
and if the tear is large, join it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not exert any force, for the ointment will soon restore it and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone is descending inside the ear toward the upper part, invert the eyelid, and grasp the hailstone with tweezers, and cut it out and press from both sides;
and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does not matter;
and when the hailstone is removed, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with something that generates flesh until the patient is healed.
