Here begins the book of fractures.
This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and concerns the repair of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that fools throw themselves into this chapter, who have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read a letter of them;
and for this reason, knowledge is scarce in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing of it except through the knowledge of ancient books, which I have studied so much that I have extracted the knowledge, and through experience, and through the practice of my life;
and I have here described in this chapter what is contained, and have abbreviated it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are administered, as I have done in these two preceding chapters.
