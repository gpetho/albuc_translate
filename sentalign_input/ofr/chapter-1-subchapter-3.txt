of the cautery of the head
When in a part of the head comes a sudden pain, and the ailment extends to the eye, and the head is purged by cleansing medicines, and one has done the other treatments that I have described in the section on illnesses, and all this is of no use:
then make cauteries in two ways, that is to say, with a sharp medicine and with iron.
The cautery with sharp medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and remove the skin and cut off a little at both ends, and then split the temple where the pain is located in such a way that you can place the clove of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, bind it and hold it firmly and leave it thus for twelve hours;
and then unbind it and take out the clove of garlic, and leave the wound like that for two or three days;
then put on cotton dipped in butter until pus comes out.
Afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is done in this manner.
Heat the cautery, which has this shape:
And it is called "closed" because the head is shaped like a nail or has a slight curve, and in the middle has a small point;
and place it on the painful spot, and hold your hand steady and turn the iron slightly, so that half the thickness of the skin is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, is not burned, and a lot of blood flows out.
Afterwards, put cotton in salt water and place it on the spot for three days;
then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want to cauterize this migraine with the cautery which is called "cultellare," use the very tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
