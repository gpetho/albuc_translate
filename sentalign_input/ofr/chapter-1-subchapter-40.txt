of the hip
When viscous humors descend to the hip socket, and for this reason it moves out of its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when they are measured together;
and the place of the separation is found empty, it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the hip socket with a cautery resembling a circle, and mark in front of the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is inside the circle;
and the cautery should be like the one used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and the cautery should be as deep as the skin;
and treat it until it is healed.
