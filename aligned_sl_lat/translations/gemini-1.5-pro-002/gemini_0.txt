After I have completed for you, O sons, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its completion, and I have reached the end in it, from its expositions and its explanations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is the part of operating, that is, surgery by hand.
Because surgery by hand has declined in our region, and in our time has been completely neglected, until perhaps its knowledge has perished and its trace has been erased, and nothing has remained of it except short descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered, and error and hesitation have befallen them, until its purposes have been obscured, and its force diminished: It has seemed to me that I should revive it with the organization of this treatise on it according to the method of exposition and explanation and brevity, and that I should come with the forms of the cautery irons and the other instruments of the work, since it is made with additional explanation and with the speed that is necessary.
The reason, however, why a good practitioner of it with his hand is not found in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen described, until he knows the structures of the limbs and their forms and their joining and separation, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and their number and their origin, and of the pulsating and quiet veins and the places of their exit.
And because of that Hippocrates said that reputation is great in name, but little in practice, and especially in the art of the hand.
We have already spoken about that in the introduction of this book.
Since he who does not know what we have said about anatomy is not exempt from falling into error, by which men are killed, just as I have seen many of those who are instructed in this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
Which is because I saw a foolish doctor cut a scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and he cut certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another doctor, who presumed to extract a stone from a man, who was advanced in age, and the stone was large. He therefore reached it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder. Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And I indeed had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the disposition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician, who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land on account of medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, that there was a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with a tight binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he absolved him according to his own desires. Afterwards he left him for several days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and he remained thus until his leg and his foot festered, and it came to ruin.
I was therefore called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and tranquility followed, and he escaped from his pains.
However, the infection was already established in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Then the infection ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who perforated a cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated after some days, until its malignancy increased with its owner.
Which is, because when a cancer is purely from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to approach it with a knife at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate it, so that all of it may be cut away.
And because of that, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that operating with the hand is divided into two categories: namely, an operation which is associated with healing: and an operation, with which there is danger in many situations.
And I have already indicated in every place of this book, in which an operation occurs, where there is dread and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of it, and leave it alone: lest fools find a way to speak, and to dishonor.
Therefore, take your measurements with care and protection, and [treat] your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by the grace of God to health and praiseworthy success: and leave aside terrible diseases of difficult healing: and remove your minds from that which makes you fear, lest hesitation enter upon you in your faith and your advantage.
For it is more enduring for your glory, and loftier in this world, and ultimately for your status.
For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness: lest you be called bad physicians.
Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three chapters.
Chapter one.
On cautery with fire, and cautery with a sharp medicine, divided into chapters, and arranged from the head to the feet, and the forms of the instruments, and the irons of the cautery: and everything that is necessary in the operation.
Chapter two.
On cutting and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping glasses, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and things similar to that: and all divided into chapters, arranged with the forms of the instruments.
Chapter three.
On restoration, and dislocation, and the cure of twisting, and things similar to that: divided into chapters, arranged from the head to the feet, and the forms of the instruments.
But indeed before I discuss the operation with it, it is necessary that I describe the quality of its benefits and its harms: and in which complexion it may be exhibited.
I say, therefore, that the discussion concerning the quality of the benefit and the harm of the cautery, is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a science, and a hidden secret.
Also, a multitude of wise men have spoken on it, and they have disagreed on it: and for me indeed a little of their discussions suffices, fearing lengthiness.
I say, therefore, that cautery is universally beneficial to every complexion, which is with matter and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter and the dry complexion without matter.
However, they have disagreed concerning the hot and dry complexion with matter. For some have said that cautery is beneficial in it. And others have said the opposite of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in a disease, which is from heat and dryness: since the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that something be healed from a hot and dry disease, with something hot and dry.
And he who says the opposite of that said: that by cautery benefit is made in every hot and dry disease, which occurs in human bodies: since when you compare the human body, and its humidities, to the complexion of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I indeed say, according to his discourse, that experience has already revealed that to me several times.
Nevertheless, it is not appropriate that anyone approach it, except he who has already been proven, and practiced in the last exercise of the chapter on cautery, and has learned the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their incidental symptoms, and the length of their duration.
From the remaining complexions, however, there is no fear for you: and especially in cold and humid diseases. For indeed all physicians have agreed upon them: and they have not disagreed on the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, sons, that among the secrets of treatment by cautery with fire, and its advantage over cautery with a burning medicine, is this: that fire is simple, whose action does not reach beyond the part that is cauterized: and it does not harm another part connected to it, except with slight harm.
The action of a burning medicine, however, reaches those parts that are distant from the limb: and perhaps it causes a disease to occur in the limb that is difficult to heal, and perhaps it kills.
Fire, however, on account of its subtlety and the excellence of its substance, does not do that, unless it is excessive.
Now truly that has become known to us through experience, because of long service and study with the art, and attention to the truth of things: and for that reason I am excused for the length of the discourse.
And if it were not because it is not permitted in this book of mine, I would bring to you a hidden secret concerning fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies by its expulsion, by which it expels diseases, in demonstrative philosophical language, which would be sharpened by your minds.
And know, my sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is suitable to perform cautery, and they propose spring as the best time.
And I say that cautery is suitable in every season: because the harm occurring due to the season is submerged in the benefit that is obtained with cautery. And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay: because it is feared from them that an evil may occur which is greater than the small harm entering because of the season.
And do not let it enter your minds, oh sons, that which only the common people and foolish doctors believe, namely that the illness which is healed by cautery never returns: and they consider this a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cautery is nothing but a substitute for medicine, which alters the complexion, and dries the humors which are the causes why pains occur.
Nevertheless, cautery surpasses medicine in the speed of its effectiveness, and the power of its operation, and the intensity of its control: and it is possible that the illness may return at some point in time according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and its strength: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and what happens to him in his acquisition from foods, and similar causes, unless it is an illness in which cautery is administered.
A subtle illness in a limb of few superfluities and humors, such as cauterizing a tooth because of pain, and things similar to it, it is possible that that pain may not return in it. But that happens in few cases.
But indeed the common saying again, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is a correct saying: not according to what they intend by it: since they believe that there is no treatment that compares with medicine, nor with anything else after the use of cautery.
But the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, only because when we administer methods of treatment in any illnesses, and those medicines are ineffective, then finally we administer cautery, and it is effective: then it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish doctors understand.
The ancients, however, said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron: and they did not say that except because of the evenness of gold and the refinement of its substance: and they said that the place of cautery does not produce pus. But that is not absolutely true: because I have already tested that, and I found that it does not do that in some bodies but not in others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said. However, when you heat a cautery made of gold in a fire, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the extent that you wish, because of the redness of the gold: and when it quickly cools, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the practitioner falls into difficulty because of that: and because of that, cautery with iron is faster for us and more convenient, because of its suitability for the operation.
And I have indeed arranged this chapter on cautery according to the chapters: and I have arranged them from the head to the feet: so that it may be easy for the one seeking what he wants from it.
Chapter 2
Cautery here helps against the dominance of moisture and coldness over the brain: which two are the causes of lethargy, and an abundance of flow of humors from the head to the regions of the eyes and ears, and excessive sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and generally every illness which occurs from coldness, such as paralysis, and lethargy, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cautery is that you first instruct the patient to be purged with a dissolving medicine cleansing the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the patient, and his age, and his constitution demands.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor. Then make him sit squarely between your hands, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes. Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink.
Then heat an olive-shaped cautery: whose form is this.
Then place it on the spot marked with ink, lowering it, by which your hand is gradually tightened, and you turn it. Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
But if you see now exposed from the bone the amount of the head of a probe, or the amount of a zeuherbi, then lift your hand. And if not, repeat with your hand using the same iron, or with another one if it gets cold: until the bones, which I told you about, are visible.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak cotton in it, and put it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Then put on it cotton soaked in butter, and leave it on the place until the scar of the burn is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
They have already said that the more a wound remains open, it emits pus: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cautery should be held until some of the thickness of the bone is burned.
Then after that which has been burned from the bone is scraped, then it should be treated.
And others say that it is necessary that with the cautery one should reach the furthest point, until it makes a strong impression in the bone, so that the bone which is shaped like a hazelnut falls out: or the instrument which women place infused with a little alphabet: and they believe that vapors of the head are breathed out from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it heals.
But to me, these two types of cautery do not seem at all suitable except in certain people by way of fear.
And to leave it alone, in my opinion, is better for the patient's health.
For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other limbs: and especially when the head of the patient is naturally weak: and indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore operate with it in safety.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the entire head: and it is prolonged in the patient, and he uses clysters, and decoctions, and purges for the head, and oils, and plasters. And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of these things benefit him: then consider. For if the head of the patient is of a strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and he experiences intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery a little below that one. Then cauterize him upon each horn of his head with a cautery, but do not let it penetrate the skin, and uncover from the bone the amount, which we have described. And cauterize him with one cautery on the occiput of his head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is the place where the cupping glass is placed: and raise your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone. For the patient experiences because of that intense pain, and different from the pain of all the other cauteries of the head.
And I will speak of this cautery in its place: and it is necessary that the cautery, with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its occiput, be finer than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Chapter 4
When pain and throbbing occur in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and the other treatment, which I spoke of in the sections on diseases, is administered, and all of this is ineffective: then cauterization on it is according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, however, is as follows: you should take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends on both sides. Then cut open the painful area with a wide lancet, until a place under the skin is made in which the clove fits.
Then insert it in that place under the skin, until it is hidden: then press upon it with a compress with a suitable tightness, and leave it for fifteen hours.  Then remove it, and take out the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter on it, until the area forms pus: then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, do this with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterization of it with iron, however, is according to this method. Heat a cautery, whose shape is this.
And it is called nail-shaped: because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in its middle there is a certain small prominence.
Then place it on the spot, and hold your hand steady: and you turn the iron slowly with speed: and let the amount that is burned of the thickness of the skin be like half of it. And raise your hand so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak cotton in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then apply cotton with butter: afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the second cautery knife blade. And beware of cutting the artery in this migraine, not a true ancient one.
¶ On the method of cauterizing an ancient migraine.
When you treat a migraine, with what we have said about the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment is not effective: and you see from the illness that what we have said is not sufficient for it, with the first cautery with medicine, or with the cautery with fire, then it is necessary that you heat the bladed cautery until it becomes white, after you mark the painful area with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that: and put down your hand once, and press it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to beware of touching the jaw, which moves during chewing, lest the side be burned, or the nerve that moves it, whence spasm may occur.
And be on guard, and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery, which has been cut. For in its cutting there is danger, especially for him who is ignorant of what he is doing, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he abandons the operation with it at the beginning.
And I will come with a discussion of the treatment of the flow of blood occurring from the artery according to its method, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for it, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, apply the cautery, which we described in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with the cautery having two blades. For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
When pain in the ear arises from cold, and it is treated with laxatives and other treatments that we have discussed in the section, and the pain is not removed, then burn with a cautery: and it is that which is called "the Point," whose shape is this.
Then prick with it after its ignition around the circumference of the whole ear, as it revolves: or around the circumference of both, if the pain is in both at the same time. And keep the cautery a little away from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink: and let the number of cauterizations be ten points in each ear, or approximately that.
Then treat the areas until they are healed.
On the method of cauterizing in torticollis.
Chapter 7.
Torticollis, which is treated with cauterization, is only one of the types that arises from phlegm, as we have stated in the divisions of illnesses.
And avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness, and spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this type of torticollis with medicines, and head purges, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower than its temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips.
And place your cautery opposite the affected part. Since softening does not occur, except in the part that appears healthy.
And the manner of cauterization is, that you cauterize it with a cautery directly on the upper tip of the ear below the corner of the head a little: and another on the temple: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb. And remove your hand with the cautery, as soon as an amount half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, whose form was presented earlier: however, it is not much thinner than it, as you see: and it is necessary that the blade on it be a little extra thick.
Then treat the locations with what was described before, until they are healed.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each corner of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what has been said before: and the manner of cauterization should be according to what has been said before.
He is also cauterized with a cautery above the mouth of the stomach: and this is the most extreme measure.
Then he should be treated with what has been described before.
Chapter 9.
It is necessary that at first the patient be given in a drink large doses of hiera and pills that cleanse the brain.
Then shave the patient's entire head, and place on the back of his head the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times.
For this is the method of cautery: and do it according to the same order, which I described there.
If therefore he is healed by this, good. If not: then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and leave between each cautery the width of a finger.
Then treat the cautery with what has been described before.
But if you want to add more, and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him in the middle. And if you want to add more, then cauterize him on the two temples.
Then treat him until he is healed, and the cautery should be olive-shaped according to the form previously described.
On the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter 10
You should proceed to cleanse the head with hiera and with what we have mentioned.
Then shave the patient's head: afterwards cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on the back of it, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
But if you need, in the illness with softening of the body, more than these, and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, the last one with the cautery until much of his skin is burned, and lift your hand. Then treat him until he is healed: and thus the Olivary cautery.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless his epilepsy is from phlegm.
It is necessary, therefore, that you first cleanse his brain with hiera, and with the other treatments that we have described in the division: when the patient is an adult, or tolerant in receiving medications.
But if it is a child, who does not tolerate medications, then a gargle is administered, and mastications cleansing the brain, before that for many days with improved foods.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to the preceding method: and with another cautery on his occiput, and on each horn of his head with a cautery. But if the patient is strong, and is tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries, which I spoke of in the one having paralysis, and softening of the body upon the vertebrae of the neck, and vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a subtle cautery, according to this method.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in Melancholy.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors, and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries, which we have mentioned in the one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess declining to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink something which cleanses his brain, according to what has preceded in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a neatly made compress of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting upright should be held on all sides.
Then present the liniment. And the more suitable is made from old sheep butter. And heat it over a fire with moderate heat, as much as the finger can tolerate when inserted into it. Then pour it onto the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the patient once a week, with his other good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize him by making very small punctures, except that you hold your hand with the cautery: rather let it be by smelling.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place over it cotton soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in water descending to the eye.
Chapter 13.
When the beginning of the water in the eye is revealed to you through the signs, which I spoke of in the division, then begin and have the patient drink that which cleanses his head.
And keep him from all moistures, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him upon both temples with two cauteries, if there is a beginning of a descent of water in both eyes at the same time: or on one side, if there is a beginning of water in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauterizations on it be long in the width of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
But if you see any of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting, and caution against the flow of blood.
And sometimes he is cauterized on the neck, below the two bones, with two cauteries produced last.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing for chronic Lachrymal conditions.
When the tears of the eyes are chronic, constant, and are above the veins and arteries that are on the outside of the head, it is confirmed that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I described in the beginning of the falling water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. And if you need to do more, then cauterize him on each side, cautiously near the eye, on the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing for a foul odor of the Nose.
When you treat it with what we have said in the section, and the treatment is not effective: then hurry, and give the patient scammony to drink for three nights: then shave their head and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery. Then cauterize him with a nail-shaped cautery, two burns, above both eyebrows slightly under the hair.
And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the shape of the nail-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing for softening of the eyelid.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on each side: and let them be extended from the two temples: and let the length of each cautery be according to the lengths of the eyebrow: and do not extend your hand with the cautery, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.
On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn inward, pricking the eye.
Cauterization in this case is by two methods: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.
In cauterization with fire, however, order the patient, before doing it, to let his eyelashes grow, if he is among those who trim them, until they lengthen and become even. But if they prick him at their root, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move, until they grow out.
When therefore they grow out and become even, then place the patient's head in your lap: then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with ink, a mark that is in the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the eyelashes.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the figure, which you marked little by little in many passes, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is burned, all of it appearing distinctly.
And the sign of the success of your work is this: if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting, and the eyelashes rising up at the corner of the eye.
Therefore, lift your hand then, and leave it alone for three days.
Then place upon it lint with butter until the scar is removed. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if any of the hairs return after a time, and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that place, as you did at first.
If, however, the hairs are on the lower eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is leveled so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
You are to instruct the patient to leave the hairs alone until they lengthen and become even. Make from cloth paper a shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, of each one ounce in weight, or about that: then grind them together thoroughly, and do this quickly, so that it does not cool down. Then spread some of it on the paper that you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes. And place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white: and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it lightly. And you should move it whenever the patient feels the biting of the medicine: because its bite feels like fire.
Therefore, while this biting sensation continues, then release the medicine, and move it with your finger. When, therefore, the biting subsides, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And then observe, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised in contraction with fire, or with an incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat with the medicine over the area, on which the medicine does not leave an impression, and does not blacken, until your work is uniform, and the eye is contracted.
Then put cotton with butter on it, until the burned skin is removed. Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you during the operation, that you take the greatest care, lest any of the medicine fall into the eye.
But if the eyelid softens after some days, and some of the hairs irritate the eye, then repeat the medicine over that place, which softens from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first. Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And you should know that the eyes of men differ in size, both large and small. Therefore, let your consideration be according to that: and the path of correctness is not hidden from him who has zeal for this art.
On the method of cauterizing a lacrimal fistula.
When you treat a fistula, with what we have said in the sections on diseases, and your treatment is ineffective, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head in your lap, and let an assistant hold his head between his hands in such a way that he does not move it, nor does he shake his head.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over his eye: then heat a cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's quill from one end, with which the cauterization is done: and if you wish, let it be penetrating up to the other end, and if you wish, let it be upwards like a tent.
However, this concave one is better for your work.
Then squeeze the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Then place upon it the cautery, which should be made very hot.
And hold your hand with it for a short time near the cautery away from the eye, towards the side of the nose, so that your hand does not err, or the patient become restless: and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If, therefore, you arrive at the beginning of your cauterization right to the bone, it will be good. And if not: then repeat the cauterization once, or twice, if you need to: and leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if forty days pass and it is not healed: then apply a sharp corrosive medicine on it until the bone is exposed: and scrape it as described in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the early ones mentioned. Focus on the location of the fistula, and cut it open: then insert into that fissure a thin camahan, that is, a thin cannula, the shape of which is this. And pour into it a drachm's weight of molten lead, and hold your hand with the cannula firmly in place, and the patient should not move at all, so that the molten lead does not run or reach his eye.
And you should place over the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white, or in water.
For the lead burns the site of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful healing.
And if the fistula is healed, with what we have described of cautery and treatment, that is good. And if not, then it is necessary to treat the nostril opening, and return the fistula to the course of the nose, according as it will come to its own proper place.
¶ On the method of cauterizing fissures of the lips.
Often fissures occur on the lip, which are called hairs, and especially on the lips of children.
When, therefore, you treat these fissures, with what we have said in the section on diseases, and the treatment is not effective, then cauterize with a small knife-shaped cautery, according to this form.
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then place it, heated, quickly into the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depths of the fissures.
Then treat it with a carrot until it is healed.
On the method of cauterizing a fistula of the mouth.
When an abscess occurs in the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it forms pus, and ruptures: afterward it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms: then you treat it, and the treatment is ineffective, then it is necessary that you heat a cautery according to the size which the fistula can accommodate. Then insert the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth, and its end: do this once, or twice.
Then treat it after that, with what we have said about treatment until it is cured.
If therefore the discharge of pus ceases, and it heals, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come in its own chapter.
On the method of cauterizing in the gums, and softened teeth.
When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth are loose, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the head of the patient in your lap.
Then heat the cautery, the form of which will come after this, so that you place the cannula over the tooth: and insert the heated cautery into it quickly: and hold your hand for a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire now reaching the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand: then repeat the cautery a few times, according to your desire.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
For the loose tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
On the method of cauterizing in toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold in it, or a worm, and treatment with medicines is not effective: then cautery is used on it in two ways: either cautery with butter or cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is done by taking cow's butter and boiling it in an iron spoon or in a bronze vessel. Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe. Then submerge it in the boiling butter and place it quickly on the aching tooth, and hold it there until it cools; then repeat this several times until the power of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool, or cotton, in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth; and place a hot iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depths of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterization with fire, however, is done by applying a bronze tube, or an iron tube. And let there be some thickness to its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's bone.
Then heat the cautery, whose form will be shown, and place it on that tooth, and hold your hand there until the cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or on another day.
And it is necessary when applying that cautery, that the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour, then spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, according to what is possible, and this is the shape of the cannula.
On the method of cauterizing scrofulous tumors.
When scrofulous tumors are from phlegm, and from cold humors, and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them quickly, then heat a concave cautery, whose shape is this.
Having two open ends, so that the smoke may come out by the cautery from one end: and place the heated cautery upon the abscess once, and a second time, if you need it, until it reaches the depths of the abscess.
But if the abscess is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it cotton soaked in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment, until it heals in the shape of a tube.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in hoarseness of voice, and constriction of breath.
When humors prevail over the windpipe of the lung, and especially when that is with a coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated first with loosening medicines.
Then cauterize him on the nape of the neck at the base of the throat in a depressed place: and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor into the skin, except a little of it.
Then cauterize him with another cautery at the joint of the neck at its last vertebra: and let the cautery be key-shaped according to the method which preceded.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in diseases of the lung, and coughs.
When a cough and disease of the lung are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is old: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the pit of the throat in places depressed, smooth, and empty. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be of a cannula according to the form that preceded.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncturing with the cautery, which is called "Punctum," whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to almost as many again.
Then treat him with what has been described previously, until he is healed.
And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form. Therefore, cauterization is facilitated with it, when you make three cauteries with it at one time.
Chapter 27.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated because of moistures, and is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation, until it is accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation. Then the patient is laid on his back or on his healthy side. Then lift the skin, which is on the inside of the shaking palsy upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then heat a cautery having two tips with fire. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will come with four burns.
And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three tips, therefore the shape of the cauterization is then of six burns: and the tips are according to the thinness of a probe.
And this is the form of a cautery having three tips.
And sometimes one is added to this method, therefore there are eight burns.
Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cautery. Then have the patient maintain stillness, so that the limb is not moved for some time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and that rarely happens, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a clavicle-shaped cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
On the method of cauterizing the stomach.
When much cold and dampness occur in the stomach, so that they draw it out of its proper state, and catarrhs multiply towards it, and frequent methods of treatment do not help, then it is necessary that the sick person be laid on his back, and extend his legs and his hands. Then cauterize with three cauteries, with a cautery under the spoon of the breast bone the width of one finger with a key-shaped cautery, and with two cauteries below on both sides of the one cautery, until the shape of the cauteries becomes triangular. And keep a distance between each so that they do not join, when they form pus.
And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this cauterization is done be a single one in the shape of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by dotting it for someone who is afraid of this cautery: and it is that you mark a dot on the stomach of the size you want with ink: then cauterize it with a dotting cautery: then treat it with the treatment which was described before until it is healed.
¶ On the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and wetness, or from gross wind, until it departs from its natural complexion by superfluous evacuation, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and you mark with ink three cauteries according to this form, and this same size over the liver below the hypochondria, where the elbow of the man reaches: and let the space which is between each cautery be the width of a finger: and let the cautery be straight along the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cautery very hard.
And let the amount that is burned in the thickness of the skin be half its size, not more: and let the patient be standing on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who now stretches out his legs and raises his arms.
This is the form of the cautery.
And indeed it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-like cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And take care not to proceed to the last in cauterization, and the entire thickness of the skin be burned, so that the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
On the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
When a discharge occurs, and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, a dull pain and heaviness attack the patient without sharpness: and if it is in the membrane of the liver, there is intense sharpness with the pain: and now you see that its treatment has exhausted physicians.
It is necessary, therefore, that the patient lie on his back. Then mark the location of the abscess with ink: then heat a cautery that resembles a spoke. And this is its shape. And cauterize with it one burn, until the entire skin is burned, and it reaches the membrane, until all the pus comes out: then treat it with the treatment of open wounds, until it is healed.
And one should not use this kind of cautery unless one's study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands these illnesses occur with some experience: for then he may dare such an operation.
But truly, to leave it alone, in my opinion, is better.
On the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
The ancients said, cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy according to this method. And it is, that you should take of the long, dried roots of birthwort, one root, the longest that is found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger. Then submerge it in oil: and light it in the fire. Then cauterize with one cautery between the junction of the collarbone with the neck, and with two small cauteries under the jawbone, slightly inclined to the part that is under the chin.
And also with two cauteries between the fifth and sixth rib, sloping slightly to the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And with three cauteries on the back: one between the two shoulder blades: and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be evident by the smell of the skin.
And indeed some of the ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron like a spoke: and they heat it, and insert it between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess itself, and the pus comes out: as we have said concerning an abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is danger, because either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which is incurable.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter 32.
When you treat a disease of the spleen, with what we have described of treatment in the section on diseases, and your treatment is not effective, then cautery on it is done according to three ways, which are all correct.
One of which is that you make three cauterizations, or four, in a line along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauteries of the liver, the illustration of which has preceded.
And let the space between each cauterization be the width of a finger, or a little more.
And let the method of cauterization be the same as what we described in the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie supine on his back.
And another method of cauterization is this: that you heat the cautery having two points, which we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: and raise the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches: and let your lifting of the skin be across the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the two very hot points, until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them: then withdraw the cautery: thus four burns are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with another cautery having three points.
Then treat the burn after you allow it to discharge pus for many days: for this is more beneficial than all the other treatments that have preceded.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Cauterization is not applied in dropsy, except properly to ascitic patients.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have described in the section, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and with another cautery on the liver, and with a cautery on the spleen, and with two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and with one opposite the chest, and another opposite the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it emits pus for a long time.
And do not discontinue treatment of the patient after cauterization with it: because it is necessary that two intentions be combined for him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized, however, should be key-shaped, according as its form was described before: and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according as its form was previously described.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
When they swell up in a dropsical patient, and are filled with light yellow water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the dorsum of the foot at the knuckle, which is between the little finger and the ring finger: and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then lift your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
For the light yellow water will ooze out, and let the cautery be according to this form/shape.
Then make two cauterizations on both legs, on each leg, and let the cauterization be done with the knife edge of the cautery: and let the cauterization be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below it, about the middle of the leg: and on each thigh two cauterizations: and leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time: so that some water oozes from it: then treat it with the other things that we have described.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in looseness of the bowels.
Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and humors, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers, which are in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with methods of treatment, and is not cured: and you see the patient tolerating the cautery with excessive strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four cauterizations around the navel, thin ones, with the thin key cautery: and a cauterization on the buttock above the ischial tuberosities, a large one, or two cauterizations.
And if you see excessive humors, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the pubic bone, and a cautery on each ilium: and perhaps you will add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one.
It is indeed a successful treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter 36.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from gross, cold humors, or corrupt humidities, and they are treated with what we have said in the section, and the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the back below the sacrum somewhat in a triangular fashion, and with a cautery below the navel by about two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach has been chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming pale, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and with a cautery over his liver, and another over his spleen, with a key-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 37
When you excise a polyp, then heat a cautery that resembles a spoke. Then insert the heated cautery into the excised polyp: and withdraw your hand slightly until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein, from which blood flows: do this once, or twice.
If, therefore, there are many polyps, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described. Then treat them with what benefits them from among ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on a small pan, it is more effective in helping.
On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38.
When the patient does not submit to the incision and procedure that we described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery.
When, therefore, a fistula happens to someone, and it becomes chronic, pus runs from it, and corrupted fluids. It is more fitting, therefore, that you should probe it with a thin probe. Then determine the extent of its depth with the probe.
Then heat a cautery that is similar to a spoke. Then insert it, ignited, into the fistula itself to the same extent that the probe entered.
And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupted tissues are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
And beware of burning a nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein: or if the fistula goes to the wall of the bladder, or to the wall of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the area until it heals.
But if the area is sealed, and the discharge ceases from it, and it remains so for a long time, then you will know that it has already healed completely.
And if the discharge does not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is diseased bone in its depth, or something like that, the treatment of which will come in its proper place.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold, or from gross flatulence, and because of this one's strength is diminished, then it is necessary that you cauterize above the flank, above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over the entire kidney using a key-shaped cautery, the description of which has come before.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the flank itself. Thus, three lines will appear. Therefore, they will be of utmost benefit.
On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize him in the lower part of the back above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, with one cautery on the right of the back and another on its left: and the length of that cauterization laterally should be the size of a thumb's knuckle: and cauterize him with a cautery on the lower back, or with two cauteries, if you need to: and let it be a key-shaped cautery as before.
On the method of cauterizing the uterus.
When cold and dampness occur in the uterus, and because of this impregnation is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their flow is delayed, and pain occurs with their arrival, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said concerning the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the coccyx on the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be key-shaped.
On the method of cauterizing the hip in dislocation.
When mucous fluids are poured out at the hip socket, and become the cause of its displacement from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other, when they are compared together: and the place of the dislocation is found empty.
Therefore, it is necessary that you cauterize the patient over the hip socket itself with a circular-shaped cautery: after you mark with ink around the socket, just as it turns: and so that the socket itself falls in the middle of the circle.
But if you do not have this cautery available, then cauterize it with three burns, with a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing for sciatica.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and the causes of it are cold and wetness: and the patient is treated with what we have described in the section [on it], and the treatment is ineffective, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of gross humors with foul-smelling pills, or with compound pills, and similar things. Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is, that you cauterize on his hip joint with three triangular cauteries, in this shape. And make a good or bad depth for them. And let the space that is between each cautery be the width of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes, however, cauterization is done in the middle, on the head of the hip itself. Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you want to cauterize with a circle, the form of which preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: so that the circle contains the whole hip.
And burn the entire thickness of the skin.
This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain adheres to the hip itself, and does not extend to the hip and leg.
But if it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, on the place where the sick person indicates there, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the ankle four fingers toward the outer part a little: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize him there where he indicates with a pointed cautery, three or four, or more, if he needs it.
And if he indicates the pain to be under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with one knife-shaped cautery.
And beware in all your cauterization that you do not ultimately burn a nerve or a large artery with the cautery, and thereby bring upon the sick person a bad injury or contraction.
And indeed I have seen one and another of those who cauterized above the ankle, and they persisted in cauterization, and the leg swelled up until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted: then diarrhea occurred, and death after that.
But if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each in this way.
And certain wise men have spoken about the cauterization of the hip, the method of which cautery is this. Make something like a drill out of iron, whose diameter is half a palm, and at its opening, it should be the thickness of a date pit, or a little less, and inside that drill there should be a third drill.
And let the space that is between each drill be the size of a thumb knuckle, and let the drills be open on two sides, and let their height be about a knuckle or two knuckles, and make for them a handle of iron suitably fitted to the drills.
Then let it be heated in fire until it glows red and throws off sparks; then it should be placed upon the hip joint, the sick person lying down on his healthy side. Therefore, cauterize him with three round burns in one place.
Then leave him for three days. Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Albucasis says, "With this type of cautery, my sons, we have used it little, because of the frightening nature of its appearance: and because we have found few who can endure it.
Nevertheless it is among the good cauteries for him who endures it, and finds the right place for it.
The cautery with burning medications is such that you make two hinges having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge pin of its gate of brass, or iron, the length of the wall: whose height should have two knots, or thereabouts.
And let the space which is between each be the width of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let them contain each other, according to this form.
Then place it over the hip joint socket, with the patient lying on their healthy side. And press your hand firmly upon the hip joint socket. Then pour between the two circles some hot water, which has been slightly heated with fire, and hold it there for the length of an hour: and let the patient endure its bite and its burning, for they will feel a bite like fire, until the burning subsides.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe the hot water from the entire hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
And apply butter to it, until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for a few days, and pus will flow from it. For this is the ultimate in healing.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
But if the pain extends to the hip or leg, make for it a bath that holds water, just as you did for the hip.
And this is the method for hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, one part of each: grind both and put them in a new pot, whose bottom is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that a ray may enter it: and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot: and pour fresh water over the alkali and lime, so that it submerges both by a finger's breadth: after you have pressed them down well with your hand: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Then gather all that water and pour it over other lime, and strain it until it is renewed/purified.
For it will then be very strongly sharp, which is used in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the other limbs. Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
And among the medicines with which hemorrhoids are cauterized, are also arsenic sulfide, and anacardic honey, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
And indeed Galen, in narrating, related the cure of a certain man from ancient times, by which the pain of hemorrhoids and sciatica was cured; and he greatly praised its efficacy. And he said that he did not need any other treatment, and that he was healed at once, until he related that he himself perhaps entered a bath carried in, and came out of it already healthy.
And it is that some fresh, green hellebore is taken, and if green is not found, dry, fresh is taken, and it is ground thoroughly with a little fat, and placed on the hemorrhoid, where the pain is, or the leg, or on the hip, and it is bandaged and left for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels the burning sensation abate. Then have him enter the bath.
When, therefore, his body becomes dewy, have him enter the bathtub. For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines, except after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides also said that goat dung, when the sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and cauterization is done in this way. Let wool be taken, and soaked in old oil, and placed on the deep place, which is between the big toe and the ankle bone, and is nearer to the ankle bone.
Then take dry goat dung, and ignite it in fire, until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished. Then repeat it. Therefore, do not cease to do this until the sensation reaches over the middle up to the hip, and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called punctate cautery.
On cauterization of back pain.
Sometimes pain happens in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from an infusion of cold and moist matter: and cautery indeed is not applied except in this case alone, which arises from an infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary then after evacuation of the sick person with foul-smelling pills, and similar things, that three lines be made on the back where the pain is, along the breadth of the back itself, after you mark with ink five cauteries in each line, or more according to the amount that arises from what the sick person can bear by his strength: and let the cauterization be done with a punctate cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries, or four, with a medium nail cautery, according to this form.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This ailment often happens to small infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is this: that there occurs in him a tightness in breathing upon elevation and movement: and you find at the end of the dorsal vertebrae and its nodes, that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
When, therefore, you see this, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular, in this manner.
And the cautery should take hold over all parts of the vertebra equally: and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, two lines, or three: and let the points be near to each other.
Then treat the area until it heals with what we have said.
And be careful not to apply the cautery to a hump which arises from a spasm of a nerve.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in gout, and pains of the joints.
When pains of the joints are from cold humors, which are poured out to the limbs of any body, then when pains happen in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name that gout specifically.
When, therefore, gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is that you cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
And if you need to puncture the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. But if the pains ascend to the knees, or the other joints, and this happens frequently, then cauterize him over every knee with three cauteries, or four on each side, with this same key-shaped cautery.
However, if more are needed with this cautery, then cauterize him. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
But if the pains ascend to the knees and the back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in its chapter.
But if the pains are only in the hands, then puncture around the wrist bones, as the two lines turn.
But if any of the pains remain in the fingers, then puncture them, a puncture over every knuckle, and over the back of the hand.
But if the pains ascend after some days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both on every side.
And do not remove the patient from a good regimen, from taking medicines. For if a good regimen is followed, and the phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or omentum descends to the testicle, and it is incipient and nearby: then you must order the patient to forgo food on that day. And that he use laxatives, so that feces may descend from his belly.
Then let him sit on his back between your hands: and instruct him to hold his breath, until the omentum, or intestine, comes out or appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink below the rupture on the pubic bone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to a half-circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then heat a cautery, whose shape is this, until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine, or omentum, to its cavity. Then let the assistant place his hand over the area, so that the intestine does not come out: and you, having now spread open the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under him, and another attendant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Then apply the cautery upon the mark itself, with your hand holding the cautery straight. And hold it there until you reach the bone with it, or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the bone with it the first time.
And carefully watch against the intestine protruding during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and thereby cause either death or great harm to the patient.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is useless.
And the cautery for infants must be slender, according to their size.
Then treat with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on his back for forty days, until the wound closes.
And it is necessary that you arrange his nourishment for the duration of his treatment, which softens his bowels: so that the intestine does not protrude during straining and defecation.
Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then apply a properly made support bandage, and keep it on him for another forty days.
And he should refrain from exertion, and overfilling with food and drink, and loud speech.
For when this regimen is followed, thus he is healed with a complete recovery.
And I will discuss the treatment of ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
However, when ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen, and they are beginning, and you wish them not to increase, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery iron according to its size: and let that which is burned from then on be like a third of it. Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not increase.
And indeed some of the early ones have said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery iron, in this manner.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line towards the bottom. And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery iron.
But the first cautery iron is easier and better.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in pains caused by a fall or a blow.
Chapter 48.
When pain occurs in some limbs from a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is not effective for it, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery iron.
And the cautery iron for each limb should be according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the sprain, and the pain from it.
Therefore, if it is healed from the first cauterization, that is good. If not, then repeat the cauterization on it.
Because it is the custom of these pains to move from a limb to the one next to it. Therefore, it is necessary to follow them with the cautery, until the patient is healed.
On the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cauterization. And especially the kind of leprosy, which occurs because of putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you want to cauterize it, consider [this].
If, therefore, the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we have said in the section [on it], and it neither subsides nor stops: and you fear for the patient that corruption will seize his entire constitution: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head in a known place, and a second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
And [hold] your hand with the cautery for a short time, until it makes a small impression on the bone, and the outer layers are displaced from it: so that the exhalation of gross vapors from it is relieved, and also cauterize the spleen itself with the cautery, as described before.
But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries, which we have mentioned, on the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheeks, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the buttocks near the base of the spine and one above it, on the coccyx itself, and two on the hips, that is, one on each hip, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint of the joints of his fingers and toes: and cauterize on each heel of his feet, and the palms of his hands.
And beware of the tendons that are above the back of the heel, lest you burn them.
And sometimes one cauterizes with a cautery upon the pubic bone, and with another upon the breastbone, and with another upon the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more beneficial and effective it is.
And know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery, as healthy people do: because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be of a size and smallness according to the limbs and joints, according to what was previously stated concerning the types of instruments.
Then treat the burn with a paste of flour and honey, and the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for numbness.
When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize the numbed limb with cauteries, according to what the size of the limb, or its smallness, requires.
And let your cautery penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes cauterization is applied for a certain numbness, which occurs in the hand and foot, on the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume upon this, except one who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs, and the emergence of the nerves moving the body.
Chapter 51.
When Albaras (vitiligo) becomes chronic, and nothing from the devices of medicine benefits it, then cauterize upon it with a cautery, slightly deep, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with chickpea flour and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of plantain, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: of each let there be one part: let all these be mixed and spread upon a cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for Cancer.
When the cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it spreads.
The experts, however, have said that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the middle.
But it does not seem so to me: because I fear that it would ulcerate: and I have already seen it sometimes.
And it is better that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we have said: or with many cauteries.
¶ On the method of cauterizing elephantiasis.
When someone has elephantiasis, and it is delayed in ripening, either because of the superfluity causing it, or because of the age of the sick person, when he is decrepit with little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the ripening of the elephantiasis, then cauterize around its circumference with many small cauteries by puncturing. Then leave it. For it will hasten with ripening.
But if you want its perforation with a cautery, then heat a cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the elephantiasis, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be on the side where the diseased matter will flow, so that the flow of pus is eased.
Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in a malignant ulcer.
Chapter 54.
A corroding ulcer is nothing but a corruption moving in a limb, and it corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
If, therefore, you see a corroding ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then cauterize it with fire many times, with small and large cauteries, according to what is suitable for the place in which the corroding ulcer is.
Then cauterize it on all sides until you eradicate all of the corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil, until all the eschars are eradicated, and all the corruption.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Therefore, if you see that after three days flesh grows with a healthy growth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then repeat the cauterization on that which remains of the corrupted areas.
And a corrosive [ulcer] is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine. For it takes the place of cautery.
Nevertheless, cautery with fire is of swifter benefit: and I have indeed already described its cauterization with a sharp medicine in the section: therefore consult it there when you need it.
On the method of cauterizing corns and warts.
Chapter 55.
This ailment frequently occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, callous thing, which harms the foot.
And cautery on them is by two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for with fire, you should heat a hollow cautery resembling a vulture's quill: which should be made of iron, according to the size that encompasses the corn on all sides: and let it have thin edges.
Then place it, heated, upon the corn. Then turn your hand with the cautery around the corn, until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus. Then apply a plaster to it with wild mallows, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it overnight. For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
But if they have not turned inward, and occur frequently on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then you should apply the cautery to them with hot water: and that is, that you should take a small tube of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather: and place it over the corn, or wart. Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand, and rotate it with the pressure of your hand for a little while, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the corn, and the hot water finds its way deep down to the root of the corn: and let the patient wait a while on the bite of the hot water for one hour.
Then release him, for the corn is eradicated with its roots.
Do this with them one after the other until you come to all of them that are on the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in tremors.
When a tremor occurs in someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or from something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on his chest with a cautery, and above his stomach with a cautery.
For tremor subsides with an olive-shaped cautery, and healing of a cold ailment is hastened.
¶ On the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes ugly Albathir, that is, pustules, which arise from gross corrupted matter, erupt on the body.
It is therefore necessary when they first appear, that they be cauterized over the entire head of the pustule with a fine cautery with myrtle wood, the tip of which has been ignited with fire. Or with the root of long birthwort. Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized superficially, at the beginning of their eruption in this manner: and they do not increase: and the superfluity causing them is broken up, and is healed from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Frequently there happens a flow of blood from an artery, which is cut near a wound that occurs externally, or near the incision of an abscess, or the cauterization of a limb, and things similar to these: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Therefore when this happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place upon it your index finger: and squeeze it tightly, until the blood is held back under your finger, and nothing comes out of it.
Then put in the fire small olive-shaped cauteries, and many large ones in number: and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place in which the artery has been ruptured, and apply the cautery upon the vessel itself, after you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood flow is stopped.
But if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and the cautery is extinguished, then quickly take another cautery, from the cauteries which have been prepared in the fire.
Therefore do not cease to do this with one after another, until the bleeding is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve which is there, lest another injury befall the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, except by one of four methods. Either with a cautery, as we have said. Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its ends contract, and the blood flow is stopped. Or it is tied with a thread with a strong knot. Or medicines with the property of stopping blood flow are placed upon it, and it is bandaged with a compress with suitable tightness.
However, whoever performs its removal with a ligature, and binding with cloth, or placement of burning substances, and similar things, this does not help it at all, except rarely.
But if this happens to someone, and a doctor is not present, nor medicine: then they should begin by placing their index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and pressing it strongly, until the blood flow is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery. And the finger should not be removed, and cold water of extreme coldness [should be poured] continuously upon it, until the blood congeals, and thickens, and is cut off.
And meanwhile they should consider whether it needs cauterization, or medicine.
On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
We have already spoken in the First Chapter about every illness in which cauterization with fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
And I placed there chapters from the crown of the head to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the one searching may be relieved in their search.
And before I begin this, it is necessary that you learn, o sons, that there is in this chapter from terror that which is in the first chapter concerning cauterization.
And because of this, it is necessary that there be more vehement caution in it, since in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often occurs, with which life exists, at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit wound, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which are associated trembling and fear, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes there fall to you in this art kinds of people with kinds of illnesses. For among them is he who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him: because of the intensity of that which he encounters from his illness and the length of his suffering. And with illness there is from fear that which signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his payment and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore, it is not appropriate for you to agree with him who comes to you from among them whose manner is such. And let your caution be stronger than your greed and your rapacity. And do not presume upon anything of it, except after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which a laudable outcome has come.
And in the treatment of all your patients, use prognosis and an indication of that which is suitably healthy.
For in that is your aid in acquiring fame and glory, and remembrance and praise.
May God inspire in you, O sons, his understanding, and may he not take away from you direction and inspiration: for that is in his hand.
And indeed I have arranged this chapter by distinguishing it into sections, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that the inquiry which you want from it, and which you need, may be made easier for you.
On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this illness often happens to babies at birth: or when the midwife squeezes the baby's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this sickness in others than in children: and for all those whom I saw with it, death hastened: for that reason therefore it seemed best to me to forgo operating on it.
And indeed I saw among them a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head enlarged every day, until he could not sit up by himself, because of the size of his head: and the wetness increased until he died.
And this wetness either gathers between the skin and the bone or gathers under the bone above the membrane of the brain.
And the operation for it, if the wetness is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make an incision in the middle of the head, one incision across: and the length of the incision should be about two knuckles, until the wetness flows.
And this is the form of the spatula.
Therefore, if the wetness is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this form.
And if the wetness is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the fluid is depressed when you compress it with your hand inwards, and that is not hidden from you, then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this method.
And after the incision, extract all the wetness. Then bind the incisions with cloths and cushions. Then smear it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound tightly. And feed the patient all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of fluid appears.
Because sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Therefore, proceed with the incision where the abscess and the filling of fluid appears to you: and cut it as much as you can.
And take care not to cut an artery, and a flow of blood occurs, and the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of fluid.
Concerning the incision of the arteries that are behind the ears.
Chapter 2.
When catarrhs occur in someone to the eyes, or to the chest, and that becomes chronic, and treatment with medicines is ineffective: then the ultimate treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
It is necessary therefore, when you wish to incise them, that the patient shave his head. Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear. Then let the patient bind his neck with some cloth of his. Then consider where the vein pulsates. And the locations of both are the places which are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men.
Then mark with ink over each: and incise each with a scalpel sharpened on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and let this be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upwards with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers joined together.
For when a vein is cut, blood comes out in a pulsating flow, which leaps inwards with frequent leaps.
But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then you should measure from the ear a space of three fingers. Then mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.
And what you should let out of blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will let out more or less. All this according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the fullness of his artery.
Then attend to the wound. Then if any proud flesh remains on the bone, then cut it away, so that a hot abscess may not occur: then bind the wound with linen bandages.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
¶ On the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter 3.
When a person experiences a chronic migraine, or acute catarrhs due to sharp humors, and heat in the temples' tissues, or a severe, chronic headache, and things similar to these: and he is treated with methods of medical healing, and it is not effective: then we have tested in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described.
And the method of operation in their extraction is that the patient shaves the hairs that are on the temples and focuses on the artery appearing on the temple. For it reveals itself to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few people, or by the intensity of cold.
But if it is hidden from you, then let the patient bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth. Or steam the place with hot water until it appears to you manifestly. Then take the spatula, which I fashioned a little while ago. Then scrape the skin with it gently, until you reach the artery. Then cast a hook into it, and draw it upwards, until you draw it out of the skin, and make it come forth from the membranes which are under it on every side.
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it around the end of the hook. Then cut off from it a part according to the amount by which its ends are extended, and drawn together, and bleeding does not occur. For if it is not cut, and if it is not cut off, the blood does not ascend completely.
Then drain from the vein six ounces of blood, up to three.
But if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk, or of gut strings, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the consolidation of the wound, and bleeding occurs.
Then cut off the excess which is between the two ties. Do this in that hour, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery, even to the bone, with a knife-shaped cautery, until its ends are cut off, and it will remain in place of the same procedure.
And it is a better procedure, unless the patient has a fever, or is of a hot complexion. Because cautery is among those things which help to finish off/dry up humidities/fluids. Therefore it is a better remedy.
And after the removal of arteries, it is necessary that the place be filled with old cotton, and cushions neatly made be placed over it.
And after the loosening/release, it should be treated with dry medicines, which make flesh grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
But if meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood happens from an artery, then hurry to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with vitriol, and tighten your hand until the blood is stanched. But if none of those things is at hand for you, then place your finger over the place until the blood clots. And bathe the area with very cold water, until the sharpness subsides, and it is constricted as is necessary.
And of that which is lighter and easier than the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades; and let the sharpness of the two blades be like a lancet. However they are of much less sharpness than two blades. Because if they are sharp, like two blades, cold quickly affects both of them: and they do not cut the flesh quickly. Therefore, when there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: this method therefore is better than any method, and lighter, and easier.
And this is the form of the cautery.
And let the space that is between the two blades be the width of a finger, after you mark two places with ink: and place both blades, very hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its ends is elongated. For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
Chapter 4.
On the treatment of the flow of sharp, persistent tears from the eyes.
When there are persistent tears, and their flow is from the veins which are on the outside of the skull of the head, and treatment with medicines is of no benefit in these cases, and you see the face of the patient already reddening, and he feels a crawling on his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their lashes are now corroded with the corrosion, and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears, then the ancients relied on this operation in treating them, and they called it the treatment with the knife.
And it is that you instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead. Then cut three equidistant incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be about two fingers long, and let one incision be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length a little way from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are on both sides: and keep your hand away from the joining of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the width of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dried cloths, with which you may dry the blood.
Then insert a two-pointed spatula, the form of which follows immediately. From the incision that is on the side of the temple, to the second incision: and with it, peel off all the skin that is between the two incisions, with the periosteum, which is on the bone. Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision. Then remove this spatula, and insert again into the first incision another instrument, which is called a sharp knife, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side. And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure as far as the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, squeeze the places of the clots of blood.
Then put into every fissure a tent of old linen cloth, and place on them small cushions soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar. And take care that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day loosen the bandage, and administer much irrigation with warm water. Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated: until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
¶ On the treatment of acute epiphora and catarrhs in the eyes arising from inside the head.
When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs happen to someone: and you see their eyes thinned, small, and their sight is already weakened: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and the hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp, painful ache deep in the head, and sneezing follows: then understand from these symptoms, that those matters, and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
And the best treatment in these cases is this. And that is, that you direct the patient to shave his forehead. Then make one incision in it, in the middle of the forehead, or a little bit further along its breadth, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be down to the bone: and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples, which move during chewing: until, when the bone is exposed: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the wound with old cotton, or with linen bandages. Then bandage over it with small cushions: and soak the cushions with wine and oil, so that a hot swelling may not occur.
And when you loosen it, and you see that the hot swelling is now diminishing, then you should rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying medication which makes flesh grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of rosin: and you prepare a plaster from them, and it is administered for the generation of flesh in these wounds.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Everything which falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans: or it is a flowing thing, such as water and vinegar, and things similar to them: or some animal.
When, therefore, a stone or a kind of stone from those which are not absorbed nor grow in the ear falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun: then if you see the stone, instill into the ear some violet or sesame oil. Then administer its extraction, and cause a sneeze with pepper, and block the nostrils at the approach of the sneeze, after you place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear upwards.
For often it comes out with this treatment.
But if it does not come out, then administer its extraction with a small hook, that is, with fine tweezers: the form of which is this.
If, therefore, it comes out with the hook, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine blunt hook of little curvature.
If, therefore, it does not come out by that, then make a tube from bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear deeply, and stop up what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for the air except through the tube: then extract it with your breath by strong suction.
For often it comes out with what we have described. If, however, it does not come out in this way: then take some helkalimbat, or from mistletoe, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a moderate amount: and put it on the end of a probe after you wrap cotton decently placed around it: then insert it into the opening of the ear gently, after you dry the ear from moisture.
If, therefore, it does not come out with all that we have described, then quickly proceed to cutting, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of cutting is that you first phlebotomize the patient in the cephalic vein: and draw blood from him according to the measure of his strength. Then have the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision in the root of the ear near its lobe in the depressed place: and let the incision be moon-shaped, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever instruments you can.
Then stitch the incision immediately with speed, and take care of it until it heals.
But if the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell, then proceed to extract it.
But if it does not yield to your attempt to remove it, then take a thin, slender spatula, shaped like this.
And with it proceed to cut off that kind of grain which has fallen into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you have broken it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with a slender probe, or by suction, as we have said, for its extraction is thus made easier.
But for water that gets into the ear, the patient should use sneezing with pepper at first; and he should also fill his ear with a little old cooked oil and lie down on the side of the affected ear. If it then comes out in this way, it is good.
And if not: then take several stones, about the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the patient insert one of them into the opening of his ear: and he should hop on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear. He should not stop doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out.
And so the water comes out in such a way that you take one of porphyry, or of reed, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until a large part of it is burned. Then repeat with another reed, and do this many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a small tube as was described before with the stone.
In extracting an animal that enters it, if it is of a small body, such as a flea, and similar things, treat it as I said in the chapter.
But if it is of a large body, which is apparent to the senses: then administer its extraction with pincers and hooks: and the matter of it is easier than all the things that are held in the ear.
In extracting a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the chapter, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment is not effective: then it is necessary that you examine the ear in the sun. If, therefore, something of the worms appears there, then extract it with pincers, or with fine hooks.
But if nothing appears there, then take a small tube, whose form is this, narrow below, wide above: and insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates: then suck with it with a strong suction. Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
But if they do not obey you to the exit, then coat the circumference of the tube with wax, as I said for the stone.
But if they do not come out with what we have said, then administer distillations which the ancients have already tested in the killing of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring, by which you pour oils and medicines into the ear, be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. As you see, make it of silver, or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Therefore, let the pusher, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be suitably made of bronze. And if you wish, take a probe and wrap cotton around its end with a suitable wrapping: then drop oil, or juice, or whatever of these medicines you wish, into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the probe with the cotton on top, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is pushed into the cavity of hearing, and the patient feels it inside: and let what is poured into the ear be already warmed a little with fire: and beware that nothing which is instilled into it be very cold: for the medications do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7
On the treatment of blockage occurring in the ear.
Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs not perforated.
And it also sometimes happens that some men experience a blockage in the ear canal from a wound or flesh growing in it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs in the depths of the opening of the ear, which the eye cannot reach, and sometimes it occurs near the outer part of the opening a little, and the eye can reach it.
That blockage, therefore, which occurs deep in the ear and which sight cannot grasp, is in most cases difficult to heal.
And in that which the eye can reach, you should place the ear of the sick person in the sun and look into it: then if you see a visible blockage, open it with a thin spatula, the shape of which is as follows: let its tip have a small width, a part of which is sharp, and let the rest of the spatula have two smooth sides so that it does not injure the ear.
If, therefore, the blockage is from flesh growing in the ear canal, then grasp it with a thin hook and cut it with careful force until all the flesh is removed.
But if the blockage is deep in the ear, then take a thin, smooth probe and warm it slightly with fire: then insert it into the ear canal.
If, therefore, you feel the blockage with it, which the patient experiences with difficulty hearing, attempt to open it gently, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a tent dressing according to the size of the opening, which you have coated in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Or take a tent dressing and soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle powdered burnt alum on it, and use it.
But if you see that the ear is now developing an abscess, then it is necessary to remove the dressing and replace it with another dressing that you will coat in a wax salve made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides: then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge, or cloths, in cold water, and place it over the ear, and use the rest of the treatment, which stops the flow of blood described in the treatise on distillations.
On the treatment of altheli of the eyelids.
Chapter 8.
These altheli which occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore you should grasp them with forceps or with a hook, and cut them out from their roots with a small spatha. Then place powdered alum on the area.
But if they bleed, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery.
And cauterizing them is better after the incision. For they often return when something of their roots remains. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ On the treatment of hailstone of the eyelids.
Chapter 9
Often something happens in the eyelids which is likened to hail in its strength and its hardness, and because of that it is called hailstone: and it is a collection of thick humor in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
The procedure then for them is that you consider then if it is a hailstone proceeding in that which appears of the eyelid, and they move to every part, and its matter is simple.
Make therefore upon it an incision lengthwise. Then peel it from every part with ease, until it comes out. Then lift it with a hook, and cut it off.
But if its removal is not prepared for you, unless after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision a little, then that harms the patient somewhat.
But if the incision is large, then join it with a suture, and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it. For ointment restores it and makes it heal.
And if the hailstone is sloping downwards toward the inner parts of the ear toward the inner surface, then turn the eyelid inside out, and lift the hailstone with a hook, besides which you need an incision, and press it on every side.
But if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, that does no harm at all.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water, and treat the place with something that heals, until the patient is cured.
¶ On the treatment of Axirnath of the eyelids.
Chapter 10.
Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and it happens mostly in boys, and it burdens their eyes, and they have catarrhs in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun, because tears hurry to them, and because of that you see them always reclining on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, which swelling has now covered, and the bulge of Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of operating on it is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare bandages in it, and make from that bandage a circle according to the size which contains the Axirnath on all sides. Then place it upon it and press with your fingers on every side, so that the Axirnath is gathered together in the middle of the circle.
Then cut in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, making incisions lengthwise, and let not the incision be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy, in depth.
Or it is necessary that you cut the whole skin until you reach the Axirnath, for in many temperaments the Axirnath comes out through the incision in the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore, extract it with a cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers, to the outside: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and be careful not to go deeper in the incision, lest you reach the eye with the lancet, and injure it.
But if the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should go deeper in the incision a little, gently, until the Axirnath comes forth. Then extract it, as we have said.
Then soak cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with compresses.
And there are some people who grind salt, and place it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture dissolves.
Then treat it until it heals.
But if a hot abscess should occur in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ On the methods of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, from which it happens that it wrinkles as it should not.
Chapter 11.
When hairs grow in the eyelids of the eye, added beyond their usual course under the natural hairs, and grow stiff: then they harm the eye, and cause types of illnesses to occur, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and whiteness, until it becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
And indeed, Ataxmir of the eye is treated according to four methods. Either by cautery with fire. Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was stated before in the chapter on cautery. Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture. Or by reeds, according to what I will say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the patient in your lap. Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good. And if not: insert the needle into it, in which there is a thread, from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with the probe.
Then cut on the inner part of the eyelid under the added lashes with a lancet, cutting from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small cushion of cotton, or cloth: then mark upon the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, because this varies in people.
For among them is one who needs to have a large amount of the eyelid cut, according to the amount that is softened from the eyelid.
Then with a lancet cut on the two lines that you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let one cut be near the natural eyelashes, as thick as a ray.
Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of skin. Then remove all of that skin. Then join the two lips with a suture, with a needle and thin woolen thread: and wipe away the blood, and make what is superfluous from the threads adhere over the two eyebrows, with some sticky things, if you want to do it: and if not, don't worry.
Then leave the suture and threads for up to three days, or four: afterwards take care of it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts. For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its joining: but it will be better.
The ancients taught this method of treatment for ectropion.
However, in it there is concern for the patient, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And there is also another method for ectropion: and it is that you mark on the eyelid a shape that is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have explained.
Then lift the eyelid with three hooks, separate or joined, according to the following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with an even incision.
But if you are not able to hold the hook, and it is not made even: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and a second thread near the smaller lacrimal duct: and hold the threads evenly between your fingers.
Then raise your hand evenly: and lift the skin over which the mark has been made, as we have described.
Then join the two lips of the wound with a suture: and treat it until it heals.
If, however, an abscess occurs near your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with a poultice, and similar things, from among soothing ointments.
And sometimes it also happens to the eyelid, that its hairs turn inward.
It is therefore necessary that you use on it what we said about the incision: but the suture is more skillful for both. On the treatment of tonsils with reeds.
And it is that you turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is on the inside, according to what I explained. Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood: whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already cut notches at the ends of each on both sides where you hold the threads.
Then skillfully join each one over that which is superfluous from the eyelid, and tightly bind the two reeds on both sides with a strong tie, and leave it for several days. For the constricted skin will die, and blacken, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. Then treat it until it heals.
When therefore it strengthens, the eyelid will be raised: and the hairs will not prick.
And this is the form of two tubes, which you will make according to this figure, and size in length and width.
Chapter XII.
¶ On the lifting of hairs pricking the eye with a needle.
The procedure for it is that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth thread of silk. Then bring together its ends, and tie each with a very fine knot: and the length of the threads should be one palm.
Then arrange another fine thread beneath it in the needle-holder briefly, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation is clear: because it is a subtle, or minute, operation.
Then insert the needle with the needle-holder into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural eyelash.
Then pull the hair up over the needle-holder: and insert that hair into the needle-holder: whether it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then draw your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the needle-holder in the eyelid along with the natural eyelash.
But if the needle-holder is pulled, and the hair does not come out with it: you will pull the needle-holder downwards, with the thread which you placed in it, until the needle-holder comes out of the upper opening, and you see it with the vision of your eye: for then you will pull the needle-holder, and the thread: and draw out both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
But if the hair is short, then either attach to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is lifted with it: or leave it, until it lengthens after a while, and then lift it.
Chapter XIII.
When this trichiasis happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this trichiasis is either natural or accidental.
Accidental therefore arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to these.
And the method of operating on it is that you split that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and put between them a tent of linen, and bind it until it heals.
And you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict: for if you do that, the trichiasis returns worse than it was: rather use on it things that soften, like fenugreek: and foment with water, in which has been cooked marshmallow, linseed: and diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap a tent with it, and treat with it.
And the key to your treatment is that you strive with all your skill, that it does not consolidate, according to the form which it had at first.
And this operation which we have described is nothing but a certain correction of the trichiasis, so that the form of the place does not return entirely as it was.
¶ On the treatment of trichiasis which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter 14.
This trichiasis that occurs below is what is truly called trichiasis. And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And accidental trichiasis arises from a wound, or a fissure, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you prick it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal duct to the right lacrimal duct, until the thread reaches the two ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad scalpel. If, therefore, the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a probe, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two incisions in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two incisions be at the two corners of the cut, until they meet and form an angle from them: until when they are joined their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh in the quantity that its lower sharp side is, from that which follows the eyelid. Then join the separated parts: sew it with woolen thread.
Then treat them with what we have said, about softening medicines, and bandages, until they are healed.
And if an ectropion happens from an incision, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a smooth incision under the hairs of the eyelids, just as preceded. Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according as we have said.
And the gist of the discussion concerning the treatment of ectropion, when it is above or below, is that the procedure be carried out in it, according to how it is prepared from the form of the ectropion.
For it itself is of many diversities in form: and the prudent practitioner prepares his skill with whatever method is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to the natural form, or near it, and the sick person himself, according as it suits him from the procedure and instruments in most arrangements.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the adherence of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
It is necessary then that you insert the end of the probe under the eyelid, and lift it upwards, or stretch it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which is not with the sharpness of cutting spatulas, but rather is a little blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the procedure, and the spatula is removed and injures the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you were peeling that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns according to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, then wash it with water, or instill into it from a preparation made of verdigris dissolved with water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen wick: and place over the eye wool infused with egg white: and after the third day use the preparation, and with consolidants, until it is healed.
¶ On the incision of a nail and fleshy eminence of tears.
Chapter 16.
Know that a nail exists in two forms. Either it is sinewy: and it is similar to a hard, thin film. Or it is not sinewy, similar to frozen white moisture: which, when iron touches it, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not stick in it.
And both types begin only from the larger tear duct, until it gradually advances, until it covers the sight, and obstructs the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operating in its incision is this: that the patient places their head in your lap. Then open their eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand. Then grasp the membrane with a hook of small bend, and stretch it upwards. Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, or ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and bend the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the membrane: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the membrane with the thread, and stretch it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the membrane that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair to its very end.
Then cut the rest at the base of the tear duct with a thin spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that a constant flow of tears may not occur from its incision.
And sometimes the membrane is stretched with the hook alone: or with a thread, as we have said. Then it is scraped with a smooth spatula, whose form is this.
And beware lest the spatula touch the cornea, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Then after the incision, put some crushed salt, or something made from burnt lead acetate (zinc oxide), into the eye, and leave it until the next day. Then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
But if it is a non-nervous pterygium, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of pterygium is often treated with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the chapter.
But if you want to incise it, then open the patient's eye and take a thin, smooth spatula, not sharply pointed, like this shape. And scrape the pterygium from above, scraping delicately. But if you see that it thins and breaks up, and the scraping makes an impression on it, then at once instill into the eye sief made from verdigris, or red sief, or crushed salt: and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until all of it is removed. Unless you encounter a hot abscess in the eye: then leave it alone, and treat the abscess until it is healed.
Then repeat the procedure on it with the scraping tool, until it is healed.
However, if an outgrowth of lachrymal flesh greatly harms the eye, let it be lifted with a hook, and cut off part of it: and do not complete the incision, lest the flow of tears be affected.
Then drip into the tear duct red sief, or that made from burnt copper, until it is healed.
¶ On the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh growing in the eye.
Chapter 17.
Sometimes in some human eyes grows a red composite flesh, or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or comes near it, or presses on the eyelids, and sometimes turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a pomegranate blossom.
And the operation on it is also this, that the patient places his head in your lap. Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for it: and hold it with forceps, or a gesti.
Then first incise the flesh until all of it is finished off with a scalpel. And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you incise it, be either with a spatula, which we described in the incision of the nail: or with small scissors, with which earwax is collected, according as its form will come after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed, and all of the albugo is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or instill into it red powder, and things similar to it from corrosive medicines: and place on the eye from the outside cotton with egg white: so that it may be protected from a hot abscess.
But if any of the albugo remains, and hot blood prevails in you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye, and treat it with that which soothes the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it, until it is healed.
And similarly do with the extra flesh that occurs in the eye from this kind.
However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of every weak eye from a natural cause, or from an accidental cause, by operating with iron: and do not put your hand in any of these operations, until you see that that member is tolerating that operation.
¶ On the removal of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter 18.
Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and prevent its function of sight: and weaken the eye with the length of days.
It is necessary therefore for you firstly, that you consider, if the eye in which there is Sebel, is strong, and there is no other disease in it, besides Sebel: then remove its Sebel.
And you should instruct the patient to place his head in your lap.
Then lift those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be of a fine double form, according to this shape, or let there be two hooks stepped in one body, according to this shape.
Then grasp with fine scissors those veins delicately, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are released: and be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the instrument.
And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be very steady in your work: so that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red sief: so that by its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the film.
But if it is not possible for you to remove all of it at that time, then cover the eye with that which soothes eye pain: and leave it for a few days, until its pain subsides: and protect it from a hot abscess: then repeat on it in the same way, until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the scissors.
¶ On the reduction of a fractured nose.
Chapter 19.
Physicians call Arissati a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp, burning medicine, according to what was stated previously.
And if it is not healed, then there is no remedy for it except to cut open the abscess at its source, and extract all the moisture and pus that is in it, until the bone is exposed.
When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, the form of which is this.
And it is called a head rasp.
Let it be made from Indian steel, and let its head be round like a probe, which is dotted with the dots of a file, or with the fine dots of a rasp: and place it on the corrupted part of the bone.
Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand down a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Then restore the area with drying, styptic medicines.
If, therefore, the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is cut off, and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not form an abscess, and no accident occurs in it: then you will know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no other option than to redirect the fistula to the opening of the nostril, according to this method.
And it is, that you expose the second bone with an iron instrument, or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, let the tip be iron, triangular: and its wooden handle be a pyramid tapering to the end, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and move your hand slightly away from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: because he finds air coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Then treat the area with styptic and drying medications, as I have taught you.
When, therefore, flesh grows and the area hardens, then the matter which flowed outwards returns to the nose: this is therefore easier on the patient.
¶ On Reducing the Protrusion of the Eye.
Chapter 20.
When the eye protrudes completely, and there is no damage or diminishment to vision, then you should loosen the patient: then phlebotomize him: afterwards place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla. Then compress the eye on top of the plaster with many small cushions.
And the method of the small cushions is: that you take many soft cloths, and each cloth of them should be folded four times: make many of them: then place them one on top of the other, according to the quantity which the eye requires: then compress over them with a hard cloth, tightly.
And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
But if the bandage again softens, then it is necessary that it be tightened a lot: then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we have said.
If therefore you see the uvea of the eye now restored, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the small cushions, and the bandaging, and the cupping glasses, until it is healed.
On the incision of the uveal tunic.
Chapter 21.
When a rupture occurs in the uveal tunic, then it protrudes and projects beyond the eyelids like a grape seed, and the appearance of the person is made ugly because of it, and you wish to incise it: then the operation on it is, according to what I describe: and it is, that you insert a needle into the base of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle on which there is a double thread from the side of the tear duct, and make it penetrate: and release the first needle according to its position.
Then incise the location of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the circumference of the needle: and tighten it a lot.
Then withdraw the needle, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white: and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the uvea is constricted from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye swells considerably.
Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and the white moisture flows, and the eye recedes, and immediately returns to its place: then bandage it until it heals.
¶ On the treatment of al-Qamnat.
Chapter 22.
This illness, which is called al-Qamnat, is nothing but pus, which gathers in the eye, similar to dripping water, but is not the same.
And the method of operating on it is that you have the patient sit on a prepared or upright seat.
Then take their head in your two hands, and move it until you see the pus come to the bottom part of your eye/eyesight. Then it should be fixed, and not descend, and the vision should be restored: and the patient should see things as they saw before: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus is not achieved by what we have described, then have the patient sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and split with it a little above the cornea on the covering, near the joining of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the corona, until the pus comes out.
When, therefore, it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ On the treatment of water that descends in the eye, or a cataract.
Chapter 23.
We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and which is suitable for perforation, with a clear and explanatory discussion, then take that same one according to its health.
Then, therefore, you should have the patient sit squarely between your hands, facing the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tighten it firmly: then [take] the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take the needle with your right hand, if the eye is the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the tip of the needle near the edge of the iris by the width of the radius in the white of the eye appearing at the smaller tear duct: then push the needle with force: and you revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye: and you feel that the needle has now reached the empty space.
And the measure of the needle's path into the depth should be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the edge of the blackness: and that is the edge of the iris. For you will see them in the pupil itself with the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the needle as far as the place where the fluid is. Then press it downwards repeatedly.
If therefore the fluid descends immediately, then the patient sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, with the needle in his eye.
Then rest a little while. If therefore the fluid descends, then lower it a second time, except that the needle should be withdrawn.
When therefore it is inserted, and does not ascend: then withdraw the needle easily: and turn your hand back gradually.
Then dissolve some clear rock salt in water and wash the eye inside with it. Then place outside the eye some tow, or wool soaked in rose oil, and egg white: and bandage the healthy eye with it.
We, however, and those who are of our time, place upon it ground cumin with egg white.
But if the needle does not yield to you for entry into the eye because of its hardness, since there are people whose eye is very hard, then you must take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose form is this.
Therefore, pierce only the conjunctiva with it, and do not force your hand in the hole, but only make a thin path for the needle.
Then insert the needle, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, let a suitably made sleeping chamber be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a darkened room, and let him be forbidden all movements and coughing, and give him food that soothes his nature, and let him not move his head right or left at all.
And let the bandage remain according to his condition until the third day.
Then loosen it in that darkened room and test his vision, and make him see things. Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not appropriate to do this at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather, it is necessary to delay it, because water rises quickly through intense looking.
But if a hot swelling occurs, then it is necessary to uncover the eye before the seventh day and treat it with something that soothes the swelling until it subsides: then completely uncover its vision, and place over his face something perforated by which his vision is directed below it for some days, he being in that darkened room.
Then he should leave the room gradually, and go about his affairs.
And know that in eye surgery the student is not excused from occasionally watching; then he may dare to perform the operation.
And indeed there came to us someone from among those who are of Al-Andalus, who said that there was made in Al-Andalus a perforated tube, by which water is sucked.
Truly, however, I have not seen anyone in your land who has made that, nor have I read of it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the types of tubes, so that he who is ignorant of them may consider them.
Let them be made specifically of bronze, and let their ends be triangular with this same fineness, and the tip sharp.
Chapter 24.
The Treatment of Flesh Growing in the Nose.
Sometimes various superfluous fleshy growths arise in the nose, some of which resemble a many-legged scorpion; and among these is cancerous, stony flesh, of a dark color; and among these is smooth flesh, not of a dark color.
Therefore, in the case of those fleshy growths which are soft, not malignant, nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit facing the sun, between your hands, and open his nostrils, and insert a hook into those fleshy growths; then draw them outwards, and cut what you have grasped of them with a thin, sharp scalpel on one side, until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
But if any of it should remain, which cannot be cut away, then scrape it with a thin instrument, gently, until none of it remains. But if bleeding overwhelms you, or a hot abscess arises, then treat it accordingly; or if it is among the malignant abscesses, then quickly cauterize it until the bleeding stops, and all the fleshy growths are removed.
Then after the incision, vinegar and water, or wine, should be applied into the nose. If, however, the nose opens and moisture proceeds from it as far as the palate, then you know that he is now healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that there is flesh growing inside on the upper bones of the nose, which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then, therefore, it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of a certain thickness, and tie many knots in it, placing between each knot the width of a finger or less; and the patient will find a way to insert one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it like a probe, and he should draw it through his nostrils until it reaches the throat and comes out over his throat.
And indeed, street boys in schools often do something similar to this, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread together, the one end which comes out over the nose and the other which remains in the nose. Then perform the sawing of the flesh with the knots that are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is now engaged with the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread: and after cleansing the blood, place in the nose a tent which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then, at the end of the procedure, place a tube of lead in the nose for a few days, until it is healed.
But if it needs a treatment that dries, use that.
To make a head-purge, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it out of silver, or bronze: which should be like a small lamp, open like a seashell: and its opening likewise.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
And the bowl of the instrument for making a head-purge should be full, uncovered: to which there should be a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices, and flowing things.
Chapter 25.
Often a polyp grows in the tip of the nose, and enlarges, and increases with the days, until its appearance becomes foul.
And because of that it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate it completely. Then place upon the area either a cautery, or a burning medicine which remains in its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed, until it enlarges, then consider, if it is stony, hard, dark-colored, with little sensation: then do not touch it with an iron instrument: because it is a cancerous ulcer.
For I have often seen one who incised such an ulcer, and great harm resulted from it upon the one who had it.
And if the ulcer is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that incision is possible in its entirety, then bleed the patient, and incise it without fear, without dread: and treat the area with that which dries and constricts, until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the suturing of the nose, and the lip, and the ear.
Know that when a break in continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, an operation accomplishes little, except in certain people.
It is necessary, therefore, when something like this happens to someone, that you consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood: and then join the two lips of the wound with a suture: then treat it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the broken continuity are already separated, and each part has become healthy, then it is necessary that you excoriate every part from its visible skin, until it bleeds. Then join the two lips with a suture, and tighten them, and sprinkle on it dragon's blood, and ground frankincense: and place on the powders a piece of diachylon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bandaged for two or three days. Then untie it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads fall off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suturing, however, is that you join the broken continuity, either with needles, as we described in the suturing of the abdomen, or join the wound with thread, as I have taught you.
Chapter 27.
On the extraction of nodes of the lips.
Indeed, many men usually suffer hard abscesses inside their lips, similar to grains of a plant, and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore, you must turn the lip, and cut over each of its nodes, and lift it with a hook, and incise it on all sides.
Then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the bleeding stops.
Then rinse it with vinegar, and treat the place with something that is astringent, until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 28
¶ On the incision of flesh growing over the gum.
Often excess flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Therefore, you should lift it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow.
Then place on the area powdered alum or other styptic, drying powders.
But if that flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
Chapter 29.
¶ On scraping teeth with an iron instrument.
Sometimes rough, foul scales accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and out, and between the gums, and sometimes they turn black, and become yellow and green, until corruption from this reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul from it.
Therefore, you should have the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and the tooth, on which scales and something like sand appear to you, until none of them remain, and do the same with the blackness, and the greenness, and the yellowness, and other things until they are cleaned.
So if what is on them is removed at the beginning of the scraping, that is good: and if not, then repeat the scraping on them on another day, a second, and a third, until finally the effort achieves what you want.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes, of many figures, according to what is prepared for your operation: because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes.
And these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you see.
Chapter 30.
Concerning the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
You should treat a tooth for its pain with all your skill, and delay its extraction. For there is nothing to replace it when it is extracted: because it is a noble substance: until there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary, when the patient is compelled to extract it, that the aching tooth be strengthened and confirmed by you.
For pain often deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in a healthy tooth and extracts it: then the pain does not go away, until the diseased tooth is extracted.
For we have seen this from the work of bloodletters.
When, therefore, the aching tooth itself is confirmed by you, then it is necessary for you to scarify around the tooth with a lancet, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides: then move it with your fingers, or at first gradually with fine forceps, until you shake it.
Then place large forceps on it in a good position, and the patient's head between your knees, which you have already held firmly, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If, therefore, it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it on all sides with ease, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
But if the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary for you to fill that hole with cloth and tie it with the end of a thin rod, so that it is not broken at the time of your squeezing on it with the forceps.
And it is necessary that you proceed carefully with scarification around the gum on all sides extensively.
And take care with your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and a worse problem than his first pain returns upon the patient from it.
And beware lest you do that which ignorant bloodletters do in their haste, and their boldness concerning its extraction, beyond what we have described.
For many times they cause great infirmities to happen to people, which are more difficult to cure, and all its roots remain, or some of them: or so that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have witnessed many times.
Then after its extraction, the area should be rinsed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
But if bleeding happens from the places (for it happens often), then grind some vitriol and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the vitriol doesn't work for you.
The forms of the fine forceps with which a tooth is moved at first, should be of long extremities, a short handle, thick, so that they are not bent when they are pressed upon the tooth with them: let them be as you see of thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not yield themselves, nor are they bent: of short extremities, and let them be made of Indian steel, or of good quality steel, suitably made, of straight extremities: and at their extremities let there be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with a fitting, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are made like the form of the mouth of the bird which is called stork, and they are of strong grip.
Chapter 31.
On the extraction of teeth, and the removal of fractured jaw bones.
When, during the extraction of a tooth, some broken part remains, then it is necessary to place on the area cotton with butter for one day, or two days, until the area softens: then insert into it probes, or forceps, the ends of which resemble the mouth of the bird which is called a stork. This, moreover, is the form of the forceps.
Let their ends be made like a file on the inside: or like a small scraping tool.
If, therefore, it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you take care with respect to the root, and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short at the tip, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, so that it does not break.
If, therefore, the root comes out by means of that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to assist with these other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first is of a triangular tip, in which there is a certain thickness.
A form of a thin triangular tip.
And with other instruments and tools which were described earlier in the discussion of teeth.
There may also be assistance with this instrument that resembles a large hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular tip, in which there is some thickness, so that it may not break: and let it be unsoaked.
And you should know that the instruments for teeth are many: and similarly other instruments are not counted, and the prudent artisan, skilled in his art, finds by himself the instrument, according as the operation itself and the diseases indicate to him.
Because among illnesses there are some for which the ancients did not describe an instrument, due to the diversity of their types.
If, however, a bone of the jaw, or of other bones of the mouth, is broken or putrefies, then investigate it in its place with that which is suitable for it from among the instruments and forceps that I described for the extraction of roots, and assist with the gesti, whose form is this.
Let there be in it some thickness gradually, so that the bone may be grasped or held with it, and may not escape and go, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable for it.
If, however, there is a small amount of decay in the bone, then scrape it from its decay, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
On the sawing of teeth projecting above others.
When teeth project out not according to their natural course, the appearance becomes ugly because of it: and especially when it happens in women, and girls, namely those who are marriageable.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider. For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not situated [correctly], or its sawing is possible, or its filing: then extract it: and if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and it is made of Indian iron, with a very sharp point.
And let your incision, by which you cut it, be over many days, both because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not disturbed.
But if it is prominent and exposed to its filing: then file it with a file of Indian steel, whose form is this.
Let the whole be of Indian steel, and its handle of very small points, like the file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed, and falls out: then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
But if it is a tooth, from which a part is broken, and injures the tongue: then it is necessary that you file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even, and smoothed, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
Chapter 33
On binding teeth with gold wires.
When a concussion and disturbance happens to the front teeth from a blow, or a fall, and the patient cannot clench down on what he eats so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment has not been effective, then the skillful thing to do with them is that they be bound with gold wire: since silver turns green, and decays after some days: but gold never changes.
And let the wire be medium in fineness and thickness according to the amount of space between the teeth.
And indeed, the method of binding is that you take the wire, and insert double its length between two healthy teeth: then you weave with the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether it is one, or several, until you come with the weaving to the healthy tooth on the other side. Then repeat the weaving up to the part from which you began: and tighten your hand with delicacy and skill, until it does not move at all: and let your tightening with which you tighten the wire, be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Then cut the superfluous ends of the wire with scissors: and bring both together, and turn them with pliers: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue: then leave it thus tightened as long as it remains.
But if it becomes loose, or is cut, tighten them with another wire, and it will hold with it in such a manner for the whole time.
And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the binding of two healthy teeth, and two loose teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after having fallen out, and are retained as we have described, and remain: and only a skilled and experienced practitioner does this.
And sometimes something is adapted from the bones of cattle: and it is made from it in the form of a tooth, and is placed in the location from which the tooth has fallen out, and it is fastened as we have said: and it remains, and is used thus for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue, is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
And the procedure for it is, that you open the mouth of the patient, with their head in your lap, and elevate their tongue: then you cut this sinewy ligament across its width, until the tongue is released from its restriction.
But if there is some hardness and knotting in it, and that results from the consolidation of a wound: then cast a hook into it, and split it across its width, until you cut the ligament, and the knot is loosened.
And take care that the cut is not deep in the flesh, and that you cut into an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then the site of the incision should be rinsed with rose water, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Then place under the tongue a linen compress, which the patient should keep in all night: so that it does not adhere again.
But if bleeding occurs, then place ground vitriol on the area. If, however, the bleeding overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a freckle cautery, which is suitable for it: then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Sometimes a swelling occurs under the tongue which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
And the procedure for it is that you open the patient's mouth facing the sun: and examine the swelling.
If, therefore, you see it of a dark or black color, hard, which the patient does not find sensitive: then do not touch it, since it is cancer.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then cast a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it on all sides. But if the blood overcomes you during your operation, then place ground vitriol on it until the blood is staunched: then return to your operation until you extract it completely.
Then rinse it with vinegar and salt: and treat it with the remaining treatment suitable for it, until it is healed.
On the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter 36.
Sometimes swellings occur between the throat, that is, glands, which are similar to swellings that occur externally, and are called the two tonsils: when you treat them with what we have said in the section, and they are not healed, then consider...
Therefore, if it is a hard abscess, of a dark color, with little feeling: then do not touch it with an instrument.
And if it is of a red color, and its base is large: then also do not touch it with an instrument, fearing the flow of blood; rather leave it alone until it matures. And then either you will lance it or it will rupture by itself.
And if it is of a white color, round, and its base is slender, then it is necessary to incise it.
And the procedure with it is that you consider, before operating on it, if its hot inflammatory swelling has completely subsided, or has diminished somewhat. Then, therefore, have the patient sit facing the sun, and let their head be in your lap, and open their mouth, and have an assistant take [their tongue] between his hands and press their tongue down with an instrument, of which this is the form.
Let it be made of silver, or bronze, and let it be thin like a knife.
When, therefore, you press the tongue with it, and the swelling is shown to you, and your gaze falls upon it, then take a hook and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you pull with it something from the membranes.
Then incise it with an instrument, of which this is the form which follows. It resembles scissors; however, its extremities should be curved, so that the opening of each of them is directly opposite the other, sharply. Hence, take care that it is made of Indian steel, or imbibed steel.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a scalpel, of which this is the form. Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you have incised one tonsil, incise the other according to this same manner of incision.
Then after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
But if a flow of blood should happen to him, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and things similar to these among styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils. Therefore incise them according to what I said concerning the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And indeed I once treated a woman with an abscess, which arose between her throat, which tended toward a dark color, barely perceptible, which had already almost closed the throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating, and drinking water: and she would have arrived at death, if she had remained for one day, or two days.
And the abscess had ascended so much that it had sent out two branches, until they emerged above the two openings of the nose.
Therefore I hurried quickly, and I fixed a hook into one of them. Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out of it.
Then I cut it off, where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same thing to that which protruded from the other nostril.
Then I opened her mouth, and depressed her tongue: and afterward I fixed the hook into the swelling itself: then I cut off part of it, and nothing ran out of it except a little blood: therefore the woman's throat was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Therefore I did not stop cutting from that swelling many times over a long period: and swelling followed in the place of that which I cut, until it and she became extremely weak.
Therefore I devised (a plan), and cauterized the swelling between the throat.
Therefore she stopped getting worse: then I went away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ On the incision of a swelling of the uvula.
Chapter 37.
When a catarrh descends to the uvula, and it swells, and is long: then it is called elongated: and if it is thick in the lower part, round, then it is called grape-like.
When it is treated with what we said in the section [on the uvula], and the treatment is ineffective: and you see that the hot swelling in it has subsided, and is thin: then you must incise it.
And what of it is gathered together round, and has no length, and is bloody, or dusky in color, or black, and has no feeling: then you must avoid incising it. For in that there is danger to the patient.
It is necessary therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I described, by its whiteness and length, that you make the patient sit facing the sun: and depress his tongue with the instrument, whose description preceded: then fix the hook in the uvula, and draw it downwards: and incise it with one of the two instruments which I described for the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you incise of it only what extends beyond its natural limit, without further addition.
For if you incise more of it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the incision use what we described for the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary that you use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
And the method of cautery on it is only with sharp water: and it is that you place the patient's head in your lap. Then press down his tongue with the instrument we mentioned. Then take some of the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and mix with it quicklime, not slaked, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the hollow of this instrument, whose form is this, with it.
Let its end, in which the medicine is placed, have a hollow, like the hollow of a spoon's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself: and let the patient be lying on his side, so that saliva runs out of his mouth from inside [due to] the medicine, so that none of it descends from it into his throat, and harms him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you, from the beginning, [hold] it upon the uvula for the amount [of time] of half an hour, until you see it now blackened, and the bite of the medicine calmed.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the probe, and soak the cotton with the medicine, and insert the probe with the cotton in the cannula from above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula.
Do this many times until you achieve what you desire concerning the cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it: for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and cleanse what is around it from the medicine: and let it be rinsed with cold water.
And let it be treated externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
This type of treatment, therefore, is healthier than incision and further from danger.
And sometimes the uvula is also treated with something that is more subtle than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, in this way. Take calamint, and hyssop, and oregano, and rue, and black cumin, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged with vinegar, and boiled: and let the pot be properly sealed with clay: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Let it be made of silver, or bronze: and let the end, in which is the seed, be inserted into the patient's mouth, until the vapor rises through the tube to the uvula, until the uvula is greatly darkened.
Then repeat over it many times until it dries.
And beware of performing this treatment at the onset of an abscess. For it usually increases the abscess: and you should not do it except near the end of a hot abscess.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed, and place eggshell on the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is not burned, since eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is a good and safe treatment.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else gets stuck in the throat.
Therefore, you should extract what is visible, after you depress the tongue with an instrument in the sunlight, and what is in the throat is revealed to you.
And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, you should cause the patient to vomit before the food is digested in the stomach. For perhaps the attached object will come out through vomiting.
Or the patient should swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or swallow a mouthful of dry bread: or take a piece of soft, dry sea sponge: and tie it on a string, then swallow it. When therefore it reaches the place where the thorns, or bone, are, and it is pulled out, then it comes out.
If therefore it does not come out with what we have described: then use a lead instrument according to this form.
Let it be a little thicker than the radius, and at its end let there be a curvature, which he inserts into his throat with ease: and he should hold his head raised upwards.
And he should beware of touching his epiglottis, lest a cough seize him, and he push the bone or thorn with it, or the physician should insert it with his hand.
But that the patient insert it, this is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing, and he should push it downwards, or draw his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the size that is prepared for it, until it comes out.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter 39.
When a leech is treated with what I said in the section on treatment with medicines, and it is not effective, then examine the patient's throat in the sun, or near the sun after you press down his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
If then your gaze falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps carefully.
But if it is not possible with these: then take a hollow tube, and insert it into the patient's throat nearly to the gullet: then insert into the hollow of the tube an iron heated with fire. Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Then let him take a glass vessel full of cold water and open his mouth over it: and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow any of it: and let him stir the water one hour after another with his hand. For the leech immediately upon sensing the water falls out.
But if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs, or with asafoetida with the instrument that I described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this many times, because it will fall out.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot, in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot should be covered with a lid, in the middle of which there is a hole: and the end of the instrument should be placed in that hole.
Then cast the fumigation, and let the patient put his mouth at the end of the tube, and let him close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has now reached the leech. For the leech will immediately fall out.
But if it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
It is therefore necessary that it comes out with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when sight falls upon it.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat. And its tip is like the beak of the bird which is called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
On the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to what has been mentioned about them, namely one by one, in this book: and they differ in their perforation and incision in two ways.
One of which is from the type of abscess itself, and what it contains in terms of fluids.
And the second way is because of the locations in which it occurs on the body.
For an abscess occurring on the head is different from an abscess occurring on the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own method of treatment.
And among abscesses, there are those that should not be perforated, except after the pus within them has matured and reached its fullness: and among them are those that should be perforated while they are unripe, and not matured to fullness.
Such as abscesses that are near the joints.
For when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its existence is prolonged until what is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or tendons of that joint are destroyed: wherefore it is a more likely cause of contraction of that limb.
Or it is an abscess near a principal member: for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either it or, through it, the principal member.
Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it while immature: and it is not necessary to perforate an unripe abscess, not fully digested, except what is near the anus, lest the deep part putrefy, and it extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become at its edge something that is not healed.
It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of an abscess, which is matured according to completion: and it is with the cessation of pain, the receding of fever, and the lessening of redness, and throbbing, and the pointedness of the head of the abscess: and other signs.
And it is necessary that you make that same perforation in the lower part of the abscess, and its strongest prominence: and let the perforation go along the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all similar places, in which there is no bending.
But in those that bend, proceed with the perforation along that limb.
When, however, the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better that you leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said, according to completion.
Because if you perforate it before that, the flow of corruption from it is prolonged, and it is of much filth and dirt, and perhaps its edges and its depth will harden.
And some abscesses are perforated across the width of the body, when necessary, or according to what the limb requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses, or many incisions according to the size of the abscess.
And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be hollowed out and incised when it has become like cloth, and has reached the point that it is already dead, as happens in many cases, such as boils and buboes.
And there are some of them which are cut with a three-cornered incision. And there is one from which an incision is made like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an abscess of the groin.
And there are some of them in which a round incision is employed, and a lunar incision, and others similar to these incisions.
But that which does not have a head, such as mild superficial abscesses, you should pierce it with a superficial perforation, or simply a flat one.
And it is necessary, when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not rush and extract all the pus at that time, but rather extract part of it. Then plug the abscess until another day. Then extract some of the pus again.
Do this many times gradually until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old man: for the vital spirit is often released from the living being with the discharge of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not realize it.
Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound, and examine it. If, therefore, the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is shallow, then apply lint made of linen, or old cotton. And if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, it is necessary then that you insert lint into every fissure until they meet each other.
And if in the abscess you have cut away part of the skin, or have made it concave around the edge, then it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is woven, or scraped with the down of linen without moisture, and bind it until the third day.
Then discard it, and treat it with the appropriate ointment until it is healed.
If, however, bleeding should occur during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them, and place it upon the site of the bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding continues, then you must apply the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places in this book of ours, and in the section.
If, however, it is in the winter time, and the location of the abscess is [one] of many nerves, then you must soak small cushions with warm wine and oil and place them over the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you must place small cushions soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold. Until, when it is the third day, as we have said, then you must open the abscess, and cleanse it, and apply in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
This, therefore, is what is necessary concerning the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses generally.
However, following the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess, how the way to its treatment is chapter by chapter, individually.
Chapter 41.
On the incision of abscesses that occur in the skin of the head.
Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the type of nodules, which membranes contain, which are sacs for them: as if they were a hen's crop.
And their types are many.
Some of them are fatty: and some of them contain a moisture similar to mud: and some of them contain a moisture similar to bran and porridge: and similar things, and some of them are stony hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as an artery does not cause an obstruction during their incision.
And the procedure for their incision is that you examine them with an instrument, the form of which comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if it is one that contains moisture, then cut it with an incision along its length with a superficial incision: according to this form.
And begin with the incision from line b to line g. When, therefore, the moisture is evacuated, then peel away the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not leave any of it at all.
For it often returns if any of it remains.
Then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in water and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day. For it will corrode what remains of the cyst.
Then repeat with the Egyptian cotton a second and a third time, and if you need to, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains, then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess contains a fatty lump, then cut it in this way, with an incision in the shape of a cross, and insert hooks between the two lips of the incision, and peel it from every side, and strive with all your might to extract the membrane that contains it.
But if an artery gives you trouble, then do what I will tell you later.
And do likewise with the abscess, if it is stony, with the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
And the incision on a stony abscess is easier because it has little blood and moisture. And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses which are on the head in certain men, with which there is no moisture at all.
Which is this: because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman, and I found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone were struck with it by throwing, it would wound him.
In other abscesses, however, occurring on the head, besides those abscesses which occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Or place their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus downwards may be relieved.
Then treat them with what is suitable for them from the treatment.
¶ On the incision of Scrofula in the neck.
Chapter 42.
These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And of those that occur in the neck, there are single and multiple: and they are generated from one another: and every Scrofula of them is within its own membrane, just as it is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have described.
And the types of these Scrofulas are many. And of them some are stony: and of them some contain fluids: and of them some are malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
Therefore, in the one of them that you see of good disposition to the touch, whose color is clearly close to the color of the skin, and is movable in every direction, and is not connected with the nerves of the neck, nor with the jugular vein, nor with the artery, nor is it deep: you should cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b to line g, and skin it on all sides: and spread the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we have said about the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is with caution that you do not cut a vein or a nerve.
And let the spatula not be very sharp: so that your hand does not slip with the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
But if you cut a vein or an artery, or it prevents you from operating, then put ground vitriol in the wound, or some powders that staunch the blood, and bind the wound, and leave it alone, until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to putrefy.
For the blood is stopped by alum. Therefore, return to your operation until you complete it.
Then examine with your index finger if anything remains of the other small pustules: then incise them and clean them.
But if there is a large vein at the root of the pustule: then you must not cut that pustule from its root: rather, you must tie it with a strong double thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old lint, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it.
If the pustule is cut entirely, then you must bring the two lips of the wound together: and sew it up immediately, after you see that no excess remains.
But if you see that some excess remains because of the size of the pustule, then you must endeavor to cut its root, and extract it: and administer the suture which we have described.
And as for those pustules which contain fluids, pierce it with a superficial perforation: so that the location of its ripeness appears to you: and position the perforation away from that which follows lower on the body, as we have said.
Then after the perforation, apply lint with ointment, and things similar to them, so that it may erode what remains of the corrupted matter, until you see the wound is now cleansed: then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh, until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
¶ On the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
The ancients spoke of this incision of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it: and this is the writing of their discussion.
However, in those having quinsy, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided: since no benefit comes from it: because all the veins and the lung are weakened.
Truly in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the trachea, the incision of the epiglottis should be used, in order to escape the destruction which arises from suffocation.
Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should incise the epiglottis below the three rings of the epiglottis, or four, with a small incision across its width, between two of the rings for a distance such that the incision is in the mucous membrane, not in the cartilage: and this place is indeed suitable for incision, since it is lacking flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
But if the physician is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook. Then he should cut the skin, until when he comes to the trachea: he should avoid the blood vessel, if he sees any of them.
Then he should cut the mucous membrane that we have described: and the incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it, along with its being broken open, and the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
When, therefore, the time in which suffocation is feared is past, join the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines which promote the growth of flesh, until it heals.
Albucasis says. The gist of this discussion which we have related is explained only when they see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the throat of the patient: and the patient is near death, and his breathing is about to be cut off: they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe somewhat through the site of the wound, and be saved from death: and for this reason they directed to leave the wound open, until the harmful effects of the disease are resolved, the harmful effects being about three days: then, therefore, they directed to sew the wound, and treat it until it heals.
And what I myself saw was that a certain maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and with it cut part of the windpipe.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her making a sound like the groaning of the dying.
I therefore uncovered the wound, and I found the blood that had come out of the wound was small in quantity. Therefore, I was confident that she had cut neither a vein nor an artery: and air was coming out of the wound.
Therefore, I quickly sewed up the wound and treated it until it healed: and nothing happened to the maid except hoarseness in her voice: and after some days she returned to better health.
Therefore I say: that in a cut to the epiglottis there is no danger.
¶ On the incision of a goiter.
Chapter 44.
This swelling, called goiter, is a large swelling, the same color as the body: and it is common in women.
And it exists in two forms: either it is natural or it is accidental.
The natural kind is certainly not treatable.
The accidental kind, however, exists in two forms: one of which is similar to fatty nodules. And the other form is similar to a swelling which arises from a knotted artery. And in this there is danger, and one should not presume to treat it with an iron instrument, except in the case of a small one: and test it, and examine it with a probe. If, therefore, you find it similar to a fatty nodule, and it is not connected to any veins, then cut it, just as nodules are cut: and extract it with what it contains of a cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then examine all of it. Then treat the area with the appropriate treatment until it heals.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the incision upon types of nodules.
There are many types of nodules, and I have already described all their types in the classification: and it is necessary that I describe here the difference between a nodule and a fleshy outgrowth: since it causes doubt.
I say, therefore, that with a fleshy outgrowth there is heat, and fever, and intense pains, until the boiling of excess humor subsides, and the putrefaction is complete: for then the fever and heat cease.
With a nodule, however, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and a membranous cyst contains them, which is their own sac, and it is according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a gourd, and larger and smaller.
And they are of two kinds: either fatty or containing fluid. And the colors of the fluid are many, as I have described in the classification.
It is necessary, therefore, when you come to the treatment of a nodule, that you first examine it, and explore it with the instrument which is called the probe, according to its form which will come in the chapter after this.
And the method of examining abscesses, and all nodules, is that you take this instrument, and insert it into the most humid place, which you find in the abscess: and you turn your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin. Then withdraw your hand according to the extent of the abscess.
Then withdraw the probe, and examine what comes out in its track.
If, therefore, a flowing moisture comes out, whatever the color, then drain it with a superficial incision, as I have described in the case of other abscesses.
And if moisture does not come out in the track of the probe, then know that it is fatty: therefore make an incision over it in the shape of a cross, in this way, as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from every side with care: and preserve the cyst if you can over it, so that you may extract it whole with the nodule.
But if the cyst ruptures during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for that happens often, then extract it piecemeal, until nothing of it remains.
For if any of it remains, little or much, the nodule usually returns.
But if it defeats you, and a little of it remains, then fill the wound, when you have finished, with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place over it something to draw out the remaining abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
If therefore the nodule is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with something that promotes flesh growth.
But if you encounter an opposing vein, pulsating or not pulsating, then hurry, and fill the place with ground vitriol, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of the blood subsides: then return to incising what remains of the nodule.
Chapter 46.
On the forms of instruments for cutting and piercing.
Among these are the forms of probes, and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Let them be made of Indian steel with suitably squared ends, so that they hasten entry into the abscess.
And these are the forms of probes, or perforators: and one of them is called a drill, that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and sinuses, and fistulas, and buboes by means of what is between them from the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and polished, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely, from boxwood, or from bronze, or iron, or silver.
And the best of them are those which are made from boxwood.
And probes are also made from black lead, which are suitable for examining fistulas, in whose concavity are bends, so that they may bend with their smoothness along with those bends.
And they are again of three kinds. Because among them are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the extent of the width and narrowness of the fistula.
The Form of Hooks, and they are of many kinds.
For among them are simple ones, namely those which have a single curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of Scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and excised: and they are of three kinds: for among them is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Their extremities with which the cutting is done are sharp, the other extremities are not sharp: and they are not placed in such a way except so that help can be given with them in the excision of nodes with fear of cutting a vein, or nerve: and so that the weak person may be healed by them, and find some relief from the burning which he experiences with the excision of an abscess.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to the probe with which kohl is applied: and at the broad end is hidden the point of a small spatula: and it moves in it inwards and outwards when you wish, as you see.
The form of small spatulas which are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses: and the patients do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of bronze, or brass, round, somewhat long, as you see: and let them be slender.
And it is necessary that you have these kinds of cupping glasses, large and small, so that you may quickly cut off the flow of blood with them in time of need, and when you do not have medicine at hand.
However, you should not use them to cut off blood flow in every part of the body, and you should only use them in fleshy places: such as the calves of the leg, and the hip, and the muscles of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
And sometimes small instruments are made from them, similar to pistachio shells, according to their shape: with which blood is stanched when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round from them according to this form.
Chapter 47
¶ On the treatment of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to have nocturnal emissions) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain foully abscessed.
Therefore, whoever abhors this, it is necessary that he make a lunar incision over the breasts, according to this form from line b to line g. Then remove all the underlying fat. Afterwards fill the wound with an incarnative medication. Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it heals.
However, if the breast inclines downwards and softens because of its size, as happens with women: then it is necessary that it be split on its two upper sides with two incisions similar to the shape of a crescent moon, each of which joins with the other at the ends of each, until there is a longer line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards remove the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about the suture and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it is cured.
If, however, you do not complete the incision of what you ought to incise, because of the restlessness of the patient, or because of the flow of blood, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat. Then treat it until it is healed.
On the perforation of an abscess, which occurs under the uvula.
Chapter 48.
These abscesses that occur under the uvula are a type of hard swelling that contains cysts, and among them are those that contain fluids.
Those among them that contain fluids should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this diagram, from line b to line g. When all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.
Then the cotton should be removed, and it should be treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
But if the abscess is a kind of nodular swelling, then incise it as we have described in the section on swellings, in the same way.
If, however, the wound spreads in such a way that it emits pus, then apply cautery to it, according to what we have said previously.
Chapter 49.
On the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an artery and vein.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it heals, an abscess frequently results: and similarly, it also happens with a vein, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are these: for when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, collected in the depths of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a throbbing in it.
And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And cutting into this abscess is a mistake, especially one that is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large. Therefore, its treatment with a knife should be avoided, and those that are also on the extremities, or on the head, should be avoided.
Therefore, over that which is from them due to a swelling at the opening of an artery, make a lengthwise incision in the skin. Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free it from its coats until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the removal of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Then puncture the place that is between the two ligatures with a lancet, until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the swelling is resolved.
Then administer a treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off: afterwards treat it with ointments suitable for it until it is healed.
But if the swelling is due to the cutting of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much of the swelling with the skin as is possible for you. Then insert the needle under the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side. Then tie the swelling with it in a good ligature, according to what I told you concerning the tying of the uvula, from both sides with the two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread may be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole swelling near the incision of the needle: press and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the swelling in its middle, until that which is in it comes out: then cut away the excess skin, and release what is tied off from it.
Then place on it a small cushion that you have soaked in wine and oil. Then administer the treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
¶ Concerning a swelling which arises from the twisting of nerves.
Just as a swelling occurs in an artery and vein, similarly a swelling occurs in the nerves: which happens in them from a blow, or happens from excessive work, and similar things: and it happens mostly to them in the places of the joints, or the heel, and in every place in which the joints move: and it is a serious swelling.
Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in most cases without pain: and when it is squeezed with force, the patient feels in it something like numbness.
And it is not a swelling gathered in the depths of the body, but it is under the skin, and it itself moves to every side, and it does not go forward, or before, nor backward to the posterior parts.
Therefore, what of these is in the joints, it is not appropriate that it be attacked with iron. For perhaps contraction will occur.
But in that of these which is in the head, or in the forehead, cut the skin with a scalpel. If, therefore, the swelling is small, then grasp it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
And if it is large, then lift it with a hook, and peel it: then remove it, and close the wound with a suture: and treat it until it heals.
Chapter 51.
¶ On the incision of a swelling, which occurs in the abdomen.
Frequently in the bellies of some men, and in other parts of their bodies, occur swellings, which are called fungous growths, because of their resemblance to fungi.
Their root is slender, and their head is thick, and their edges are inverted. And some of them are small; and some of them grow very large.
Indeed, I once saw a man, and on his belly there were two swellings, which were more like fungi than anything else: there was no difference between them, white, with slender roots, and their edges were inverted and split, and moisture always flowed from them.
Therefore, I cut them out, and I found the weight of one to be about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces. And the procedure for cutting them out is as follows: consider then, if the patient is of a moist humor, and the color of the swelling is white, moist, with a slender root: then cut it out with a broad scalpel, and have cauteries ready in the fire.
For often much blood is expelled when it is cut: therefore, hurry, if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
But if you see that the patient is afraid and fearful of being cut with an iron instrument, then take a lead wire suitably fashioned, and tie the swelling with it: in the way that we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then tighten the lead ligature. Therefore, do not stop tightening the lead, as often as it makes an impression on the swelling, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without difficulty.
But if the swelling has a thick root, then there is some cause for fear and alarm in cutting it: especially if it is in the abdomen.
Nevertheless, it is possible that you may cut off half of it. Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound heals.
And beware of presuming to incise a swelling which is dusky in color, has little sensation, and a foul appearance: for this is a cancerous abscess: and I will return with a discussion of Cancer after this.
Chapter 52
¶ On the treatment of a protruding umbilicus.
A protruding umbilicus arises from many causes. Either from tears in the peritoneum, which is over the abdomen: and intestinal fat, or intestine, protrudes from it, similar to what happens in other ruptures. Or from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, as was stated before. Or from wind compressed within it.
If, however, it is due to a tear in the peritoneum, and protrusion of fat, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its appearance, along with what we have described, is of a more intense difference. When, therefore, you press it with your fingers, it is concealed; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it is greatly enlarged upon entering a bath, and [after] strenuous exertion.
If, however, it is due to fluid, it is soft; then it is not concealed when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it increase.
But if it is due to blood, then with these signs a swelling tending toward blackness appears.
If, however, it is due to a fleshy growth, then the swelling is heavy, thick, hard, and fixed in one position.
If, however, it is due to wind, then its touch is soft.
And the procedure in this case is that you should then consider if the protrusion of the navel is due to blood of an artery or vein, or to flatulence: then you must refrain from treating it. For there is fear and danger in that, as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of swellings caused by an artery and a vein.
But if the protrusion of the navel is due to the intestine, or omentum, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath and to stand upright outstretched. Then mark with ink around the entire navel. Afterwards, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands. Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel, over the place that you marked with ink. Then stretch the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook. Then tie it tightly around with thread, or with a cord of silk, with a firm knot: and let the knot of the tie be knotted securely.
Then open the middle of the abscess, stretched above the ligature. If, therefore, you find it already grasped by the ligature, then draw it out securely, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine into the interior of the belly: and if you find an omentum, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
But if an artery or vein opposes you, then tie it off tightly. Then return to your operation. And take two needles, and insert two strong threads into them: and insert the two needles into the perimeter you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the stretched flesh putrefies: and falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments, until it is healed.
But if the protrusion of the navel is from proud flesh in it, or from moisture, then it is necessary that you hollow out the abscess, as we have said. And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Then treat it with that which strengthens the area.
Chapter 53.
The Treatment of Cancer.
We have already discussed in the section on types of cancer, and how the way to treat it is with medicines: and that one should beware of treating it with iron, lest it ulcerate: and we have spoken of cancer originating in the womb, and the caution against its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as a cancer that is in the breasts, or in the thigh, and similar parts, from the members located outside so as to extract it completely: especially when it is beginning and is small.
However, when it becomes chronic, and is large, one ought not to approach it.
For I could not cure anyone of it: nor have I seen another before me who has achieved this.
And the procedure on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you should go before and purge the patient of black bile several times. Then bleed him if you find him with obvious plethora.
Then prepare the patient with the preparation in which he should be placed during the operation.
Then cast upon the cancer hooks which are suitable for it. Afterwards hollow it out on all sides with the skin, according to investigation, until none of its roots remain: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but rather squeeze the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instrument is possible there.
But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein creates a problem for you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped. Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter 54. We have already described in the section on types of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs, and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only the type called ascites alone, and iron is not applied to the type called tympanites, nor at all to the type called hyposarca, for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your medication has not helped, then consider [the following]. For if the patient has already become weak, or has another illness besides dropsy, such as a cough or diarrhea, and things like that, then beware of treating him with iron, because that is dangerous.
But if you see the patient is of strong constitution and has no other disease besides dropsy alone, and is not a child nor an old man, then the method of operating on him is as follows: you have the patient stand upright between your hands, and an assistant behind him compresses his belly with his hand, pushing the water toward the lower part of the groin.
Then take a pointed scalpel, according to this form. Let it be two-edged, long, with a sharp point like a scalpel. However, let there be some shortness in it, gradually, so that you do not penetrate through to the intestine during the operation and injure it.
Then consider. For if the cause of the dropsy is in the intestines, then it is necessary that you make the incision a distance of three fingers below the navel, directly above the pubic bone.
But if the cause of the dropsy is due to a disease of the liver, then make your incision three fingers to the left of the navel.
And if the cause of it is the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and also the incision should not be on the side on which the patient is accustomed to lie, so that excess fluids do not flow to that weakened place.
Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument. Then insert it into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and abdominal wall, as if you were skinning it: and let the amount that is skinned be the size of a fingernail, or about that.
Then pierce in this way, until the spatula reaches the empty place: and that is the place of the water. Then withdraw it, and insert into the hole an instrument, of which this is the form. And it is similar to a small tube: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: at its lower part there is a small hole, and in its sides there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other: and its end is made incised, like the cut of a reed pen, as you see: on its upper end there is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore drain out about half of the water at that time.
Because if you drain out more than necessary at that time, perhaps the patient dies from the depletion of his vital spirit, or he suffers a fainting fit that approaches death.
But drain it according to the amount of his strength, and according to what the patient's condition indicates to you from the strength of his pulse and from his well-being.
Then withdraw the instrument and retain the water.
This is because it is held back immediately by the skin which covers the hole that is above the peritoneum: concerning which I have told you that you should pierce it according to that method.
Then repeat with the instrument on the next day, if you see the patient tolerate it: and also draw out a small amount of the fluid.
Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until not much of the fluid remains.
But if you fear for the patient, and leave a large amount of the fluid: then treat him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the fluid: according to what I have described in what has preceded.
Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Chapter 55.
When any infant comes forth from his mother's womb, and the glans of his penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or not in its proper place.
It is therefore necessary to remedy this with its perforation immediately when he is born with a very fine scalpel, according to this form.
Then place in the opening a thin nail made of lead, and tie it: and keep it there for three days, or four.
When, therefore, he wants to urinate, it should be removed, and he may urinate. Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which passes over the place will not allow it to close.
But he whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are injured/harmed. This is because, for those who are born [with it], the opening is at the end of the head of the penis: therefore he cannot urinate forward, unless he lifts the penis with his hand upwards. Nor does he have procreation, because the semen cannot reach the womb directly: and it is a very foul affliction.
And the manner of the operation on him is that the patient is laid on his back. Then stretch the head of his penis with your left hand with strong stretching, and cut the tip of the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp point or a pointed scalpel: as is the cutting of a reed, or as you scrape something, so that its middle becomes like the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
And beware of the flow of blood during your operation. For it often happens. Therefore apply to it something that stops the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning sores that happen in the foreskin and the head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter 56.
These sores often happen on the penis, and it is a swelling of foul flesh.
And of this, some is malignant, and some not malignant.
Therefore you should lift up the non-malignant one with a thin hook and cut it away, until you clean it completely. Then put upon it cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then after that treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
But if the albather is malignant, of a foul color, then you must apply cautery to it after incising it and scraping it.
But if the albather is on the prepuce of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the albather is under the foreskin, and part of it outside: then you must remove the albather which is inside first, until when it is strengthened, then treat the outside: because when you treat it all at once, the prepuce is not protected from becoming constricted.
And indeed blackness and decay also occur in the testicles and prepuce. It is necessary, therefore, that you hollow out everything that is already blackened, and what is about to decay, or is already decayed.
Then after that smear on it honey that has been mixed with flour of pomegranate rinds, and sifted crushed herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
But if a flow of blood should occur, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, in this manner.
For cautery is helpful for two conditions at the same time, namely for the flow of blood, and a wound when it decays.
But if the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole is destroyed within an hour: then it is necessary that you insert into the urinary meatus a tube made of lead, so that the patient may urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce with the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur, except in him whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon him: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound, or an abscess: it is necessary therefore that you excoriate it with a blunt spatula, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides.
But if it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then it is necessary that you excoriate something from the head of the penis, and from the prepuce. This is because when the prepuce is thin, perhaps it is perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate between the prepuce and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then it should be treated with astringent wine until it heals.
Chapter 57.
On the cleansing of infants, and treatment of an injury accidentally happening to them.
Circumcision is not a break in continuity like other wounds: nevertheless, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we indicate in it a better operation, and an easier way leading to health.
I say, therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Which is, because I found the majority of surgeons and bloodletters using cleansing, circumcising with a razor, and with scissors: and they use alum, and tying with thread, and incising with a nail.
And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and I did not find any better than cleansing with scissors and tying with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes. Because the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower layer remains: therefore, it is necessary to cut again to incise the other, and future pain will result. And with the cleansing which is done by alum, that is, a thimble, which cobblers use, the incision of the tip of the male member is not made safe: because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In cleansing, however, with a nail, perhaps the iron slips, and ruins your work: and indeed the skin of a boy is naturally short, and many times they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have seen this.
However, cleansing with scissors, and tying with thread, good experience has revealed to me: because scissors are of proportional incision: because the sharpness which is above is just as the sharpness which is below. Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharp edges come together, and they cut according to one action at one time: and compression occurs in a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which no error occurs at all.
And the method of the proper operation is that you cause the boy to think, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, that you are doing nothing except tying a thread on his penis only: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that is possible for you, insofar as his understanding allows. Then have him stand prepared between your hands, and not be seated: and conceal the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, lest the boy see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Then insert your hand to his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the penis emerges. Then clean it of any dirt that has collected on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread. Afterwards, tie a second ligature a little below it. Then hold firmly with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature, and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the head of the penis. Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better) and place powder over it: and over the powder a cloth on which is spread the yolk of an egg cooked in rosewater, shaken with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on it until the next day: and treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Now the shape of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Let the two ends be blunt, and let them be cutting: lest the branch of the nail extend beyond them: and let the length of the two sharpened edges be equal to the length of the two handles.
However, an error occurring in the cleansing is this: because perhaps the entire inner skin escapes, or part of it, at the incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you stretch it out immediately with your fingernail before the formation of pus in the area, and cut it evenly.
But if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then draw it out with a hook, and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and what is under the penis remains swollen, having formed an abscess, then leave it alone until the hot swelling subsides, and peel it easily, and incise it as it is presented to you: and beware of the head of the penis. For it will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with something that heals the wound from the powders, which we described in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised from the skin beyond measure, and it extends to the upper parts, that also does not harm it.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
On the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from a blockage made from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or generated flesh, and things similar to these among those we have mentioned in the methods of treatment in the section.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is because of a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that the patient be on his knees, bent over. Then his feet should be placed upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as is possible for him. Therefore, with the neck of the bladder constricted, the stone is forced out toward the back: for this reason the urine is released.
But if it is not released with what we have described, and the matter is urgent for the patient: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, hollow like the quill of a bird's feather in the thinness of a spoke, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: which has a thin tube at its tip.
And the manner of the exit of urine through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool, or cotton, to its end with a good knot: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if any of the wool is superfluous, indeed insert it into the tube forcefully, like a piston.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and make the patient sit upon a seat, and bathe the bladder and his penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Then bend it upwards from the side of the navel.
Then push the syringe within it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has now arrived at the empty space: and this is not done according to this method unless, since the passage, into which it goes, is in which is winding.
Then draw out the thread with wool little by little. For the urine will follow the wool.
Then withdraw it and let the urine run through the urinary passage: and repeat the syringing, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Concerning the method of injecting the bladder with a water clock.
Chapter 59.
When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is confined in it, and you wish to instill water and medicines into it: then this should be done with the instrument called "Clepsydra", and this is its form.
It is, in fact, plugged, that is, closed. And in it are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
And the concave place, in which is that which pushes, should be according to the quantity that plugs it without addition, so that when something is drawn with it, of the fluids, it is drawn in: and when it is pushed, it is expelled with it to a distance, just as the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is Greek fire, is projected in the battles of Mars.
Therefore, when you want to inject fluids into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the fluid, and draw that which pushes upwards, for the fluid will be drawn into the hollow of the clepsydra.
Then insert its end into the urethra, as we have described for the syringe. Then inject the fluid with that which pushes it, for the fluid immediately reaches the bladder, so much so that the patient feels it.
The form of a thin clyster with which the bladder is clystered.
Let it be made of silver, or brass: whose upper part is similar to a small alembic, and below it a groove between which the tie falls.
Then take a ram's bladder, and put in it the liquid with which you want to inject the bladder. Then tie it between the two grooves with a strong tie of double thread: and warm that liquid a little over the fire.
Then insert the end of the syringe into the penis, then tighten your hand on the bladder with the liquid with a suitable tightness, until the patient feels that the liquid has now reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle out of it, and perforate it all around its circumference. Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they are turned. Then gather the circle, as a moneybag is gathered: after you have put in it what you wish of liquids, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand, until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have already discussed in the section on types of stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I explained the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys, and the bladder, and the signs of all of that: and I spoke of the stone in which an operation by hand and cutting is appropriate: and that is the stone generated specifically in the bladder: and that which is stuck in the penis: and I am explaining this with clear explanation and brevity.
I say, therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder, happens most often in boys.
And among its signs is that the urine comes out of the bladder like water in its thinness: and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs his penis, and struggles with it, and it hangs down often. Then it becomes erect, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them.
And the healing of boys is easy, from then until they reach fourteen years. And it is difficult in old men. In youths, however, it is intermediate, in that which is between that: and the treatment of him whose stone is larger is easier: and if small, the opposite is the care of it.
When, therefore, we come to the treatment, it is necessary first of all that we cleanse the patient with an enema, which will extract all the excrement that is in his intestines: for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the examination.
Then let the patient be taken by his feet and shaken, and moved downwards, so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or sometimes jump from a high place.
Then have him sit prepared between your hands, and let his hands be under his buttocks, so that the whole bladder is inclined downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If, therefore, you feel the stone in the area, then immediately proceed with the incision over it.
But if it does not fall at all under your touch, then you must wipe the index finger of your left hand with oil if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger if he is a fully grown youth, and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone until it is under your finger; and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where you want the incision; and instruct an assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to draw away the skin, which is under the testicles, on the side from the place where the incision is.
Then insert the cutting scalpel, the shape of which is as follows. And cut between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock; and let the incision be over the stone itself, and let your finger be in the anus; and make the incision transversely, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, according to the size that allows the stone to pass out, but not larger.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone near the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
And know that there are stones which have angles and edges, which is why their exit is difficult.
And some are smooth, similar to a gland, and round, and their exit is easy.
Therefore, for the one that has angles and edges, enlarge the incision.
But if it does not come out this way, then it is necessary that you be ingenious with it: either grasp it suitably with forceps, the end of which is like a crescent moon, which grips the stone, and it does not escape from it: or insert a subtle instrument with a curved end under it.
However, if you cannot manage it, then enlarge the opening a little. But if any blood overcomes you, cut it with a saw.
But if there is more than one stone, then first push the large one to the mouth of the bladder. Then cut down upon it. Afterwards, push the small one after that: and do similarly if there are more than two.
But if it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut down upon it with a large incision. Because one of two things happens to the patient, either he dies, or a constant dribbling of urine occurs: because the area does not heal completely.
But manage its expulsion until it comes out: or devise its breaking with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
When you have therefore completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place over it cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot swelling settles down.
Then lay the patient on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day. When, therefore, you loosen it, bathe the area with water and plenty of oil.
Then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.
If, however, an added hot swelling occurs in the wound, and corrosion, and things like that: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is blocked from it: and that is known from the discharge of blood with urine. Therefore insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood. For if it remains, it provokes corruption and putrefaction of the bladder.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply every type [of medicine] with what is suitable from the treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the treatment's entire duration that you bind and join the two thighs, because of the medicines which are placed upon the area.
But if the stone is small, and it is in the urinary passage, and it is lodged in it, and the exit of urine is blocked: then treat it with what I describe before you resort to cutting. For many times you will be spared from cutting by this treatment, for I have already tested it.
And it is, that you take a Perforator from white iron, whose form is this, three-sided point, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and tie the penis with it below the stone so that it does not go back to the bladder.
Then insert the piercing iron into the penis gently, until the Perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the Perforator with your hand in the stone itself little by little: and you try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
For the urine is released immediately.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis. For it breaks and goes out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not available to you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut upon the stone in the penis itself between the two ties. Then extract it. Afterwards loosen the tie, and cleanse the clotted blood, which is made in the wound.
And the tying of the thread under the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not go back to the bladder: and the other tie above, except so that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and for that reason it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upwards, so that it returns at your completion, and covers the wound, as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of a stone from women.
A stone is rarely generated in women.
But if a stone should happen to occur in one of them, then the treatment is difficult, and is avoided because of many factors.
One of these is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially surgery with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: therefore it requires a deep incision, and in that there is danger.
But if necessity compels this, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-versed: and few are found.
But if you are deprived of her, then seek a chaste physician, skilled, and present a midwife well-instructed in the matters of women, or a woman who in this art hints at part of the art: therefore make her present, and especially instruct her, so that she may do all that you instruct her concerning the examination for the stone.
First of all, which is, that she should see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and search for the stone.
If therefore she finds it, let her grasp it with her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the patient, and examine for the stone, after she places her left hand above the bladder, and compresses it with good compression.
If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she brings it to the base of the hip.
Then let her cut down upon it opposite the middle of the vulva at the base of the hip, on whichever side is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that area: and let not her finger be moved from the stone, grasping it from below: and let the incision be small at first. Then let her insert a probe into that incision.
Then let her insert a probe into that incision. If therefore she feels the stone, then let her enlarge the incision in proportion to the size of the stone so that it may pass out of it.
And know that there are many types of stones. For among these are small and large, smooth and rough, long, and round having branches.
Therefore, you should know its types so that through this you may be informed about what you want.
If therefore the bleeding overcomes you, then apply to the place powdered alum and hold it there for one hour, until the bleeding stops.
Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and see to it that you prepare from among the instruments, which I spoke about regarding the extraction of stones in men, so that you may use them in your operation.
But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been cut, then put powder on the place and bind it with compresses, binding it firmly, and do not change it, and leave the stone, and do not extract it. For perhaps the weak woman will die. Then treat the wound.
When, therefore, the sharpness of the blood subsides after a few days, and the place festers, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
Chapter 62.
On the incision for watery hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but a collection of moisture in the white membrane, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called a membrane.
And sometimes it is in a membrane of its own, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is thought: that it is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white membrane, which we have mentioned: and that does not happen except rarely.
And indeed, the generation of this hernia is from a weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them. And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For either its color is tending toward yellow, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or it is watery white, and that is what is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is located are these. For if it is in the white membrane that we mentioned, then the abscess is round, somewhat elongated like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the fluid surrounds it on all sides.
And if the fluid is in its own membrane, then the abscess is round, with part of the egg shape, and because of this, a person thinks that it is another egg.
And if the fluid is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under the senses.
Therefore, when you want to know the color of the fluid, then test the color of the fluid in the abscess with the square instrument, whose form has been described previously. Therefore, according to what comes out on the track of the instrument, judge concerning what is within it.
Therefore, when we come to treatment with the scalpel, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body is full.
Then he should be laid on his back on something slightly raised, and place many cloths under him.
Then you sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right, who should stretch his penis to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the abdomen's mirach.
Then take a broad scalpel, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, nearly to the pubic bone: and let the cut be made straight along an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it comes to the encompassing white membrane: and peel it and watch, or beware lest you cut it: and let your peeling whereby you peel it be on the side that hangs down with the testicle more: and carefully explore by peeling as much as you are able.
Then pierce the membrane, full of water, with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the membrane upward, and do not touch the containing skin of the testicles: and cut the membrane however you can cut it, either whole or piecemeal, especially its thin side. For if you do not investigate it thoroughly, the cutting of it will not be secure, but the water will return.
But if the testicle protrudes outside its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the cutting of the membrane, put it back. Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Then treat it like other wounds, until it heals.
But if you find the testicle corrupted by some blackness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels, which are the suspensory, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and extract the testicle; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
But if fluid is collected in both parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part just as you did in the other equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it: then wipe away the blood. And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the abdomen's mirach: and place folded cloths on top, and they are cushions: and tie them on top with a bandage, which has six heads, according to this form/fashion.
Then let two cloths be taken, and sewn, and filled with carded wool, according to this likeness: and let the ends with which it is pressed be made of cotton, or moist wool: and let them be gathered with a binding at the lumbar region of the arms: and let one of the ends take hold above the anus as far as the back, and let the second take hold at the part of the pubis: and two ends over the two thighs below, and two other ends over the two groins, and let the whole binding be gathered at the lumbar region of the arms.
And sometimes this branch is skillfully treated with a cautery instead of incision with a knife: and it is, that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and you cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have described: until when the white membrane containing water is revealed: then take a cautery, according to this form/fashion.
It resembles the Greek letter.
Then pierce that membrane with it, and it (the cautery) is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then stretch the membrane with hooks, and peel it off with a thin, heated cautery, and cut it as much as you can, until you eradicate all of it.
And beware of the testicle, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from bleeding, and better than operating with an incision.
But if a hot abscess, or bleeding, or something else causes you difficulty during the time of incision, or during the time of cauterization, then you must treat whatever causes you difficulty with the appropriate treatment, according to what has been stated before.
But if the patient is timid and cannot withstand this operation because of its dreadfulness, then perform perforation as I describe it, and it is as follows:
When you are certain, by the signs we have described, that the hernia is watery, then you should have the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a broad lancet: and make the opening lengthwise to the body, and let the opening be wide, so that all the fluid may run out.
Then place cotton over the area and bandage it, and leave it so that the remaining fluid can drain; then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is an obstruction to the flow of fluid at the time you pierce it, and this is only because the white membrane creates an obstruction at the opening of the wound and prevents the fluid's exit, then you must insert a quill into the wound, or an instrument with which the fluid of dropsical patients is extracted, the form of which has been shown previously: or enlarge the wound in the operation a little.
And you should know that the fluid returns and collects again after six months, or approximately that time. When therefore it collects, then let it be pierced again in the same way, and the patient will survive.
Chapter 63.
¶ On the treatment of a fleshy growth.
Know that cutting this growth is, in most cases, to be feared as leading to destruction. Therefore, leaving it alone seems to me to be safer.
And I am mindful of operating on it, and the type of abscess.
I say, therefore, that many abscesses occur in the parts composing the testicles: and this happens from many causes, namely:
Either from a sharp or pungent excess that flows to the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, the color of which is dusky, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it happens from the knotting of the arteries, and their swelling, as its mention has already preceded: or from the swelling of the veins.
That therefore which is from them, from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the character of the abscess, when you strongly compress it with your fingers. And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
Truly that which happens from the swelling of the veins, nothing of it disperses upon compression with the fingers.
And now it is possible that an incision be made upon this appearance, and upon the other flesh: and it is so that you cut the skin of the testicles. Then extend the testicle upwards, and draw it out with the white tunic: and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the spermatic cord after you free it on every side from the parts of the testicle.
If, therefore, the testicle is hardened with those fleshy growths, then it is necessary that you draw out the testicle, and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between some part of the tunic or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a fleshy growth in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you incise all of it, and draw out the testicle, as we have said.
When, therefore, your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 64
¶ On the treatment of varicose veins, which are with a vine.
A varix is a swelling wrapped in a certain covering, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and movement, exercise, and walking become difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear, because of that which was mentioned before.
But it is necessary that we describe the operation on it according to what the ancients did.
I say, therefore, that it is necessary that you have the patient sit on a raised seat. Then push the suspensory of the testicles downwards. Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels which are near the penis: and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with strong tension.
Then cut with a broad, sharp scalpel with a transverse incision directly on the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape from every side, just as we told you regarding the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Afterwards, fix in them a needle on which is a double thread, and tie it off in the first of the places to which the veins run: and tie it off again at the last of them. Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision along the length of the body, and extract what is collected of foul, corrupted fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which you wish to generate pus, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles may fall off. For there is no harm through that.
But if the vein happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary for the testicles to be extracted because of this, along with the vessels: so that the testicle is not deprived of nourishment, due to the incision, and wastes away, or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
Chapter 65.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The origin of this hernia is from a cut, which occurs in the membrane stretched over the abdomen in the part of the groin from an abdominal wall rupture.
For this reason the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles. And this rupture is either from the membrane or its distension.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the distension of the membrane. Is that it happens gradually over a long time, and it does not happen suddenly: and the swelling is uniform toward its depth: because the membrane compresses the intestine.
And its sign when it is from the cutting of the membrane, is that it causes severe pain to occur suddenly from the beginning: and the swelling is irregular, appearing close under the skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its passage to the outside of the membrane.
And sometimes a rupture comes forth with the intestine: and this is called intestinal rupture, and hernia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes excrement enters the intestine and is retained there: and with it is the danger to the patient: because it causes severe pain, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this illness with a knife, there is danger: therefore it is necessary to be cautious in acting in it.
And the method of operation is that you instruct the patient to replace the intestine with his hand to the inside of his abdominal cavity, if it yields to replacement. Then he should be laid on his back on your hands: and raise his legs.
Then stretch the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the entire skin of the scrotum lengthwise. Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according as you need to open the incision with them: and the incision should be according to the size that is possible, so that the testicle may emerge from it.
Then peel off the tunica vaginalis, and what is under the skin of the scrotum, until the white, hard tunica albuginea is revealed on all sides: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white tunica vaginalis, which is under the skin of the testicle, and between the second tunica vaginalis, and loosen with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the testicle.
Then move the skin of the scrotum inwards with your right hand: and with this stretch the tunica albuginea upwards with your left hand: and lift the testicle with the tunica vaginalis towards the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards: and you loosen the adhesion, which is behind, with a complete loosening.
And search with your fingers, so that there is not any part of the intestine wrapped up there in the hard, white tunica albuginea. But if you find any of it: then push it down to the lower abdomen.
Then take a needle, in which there is a thick thread, made of twisted linen from ten threads: and insert it at the edge of the tunica vaginalis, that is, of the membrane, which is under the skin of the scrotum that follows the incision: then cut the ends that protrude from the thread, until there are four threads. Then arrange some of them over others in a figure that is in the form of a cross: and tie with them the tunica vaginalis, about which we have spoken, since it is under the skin of the scrotum with a strong knot, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can send anything to them: so that a hot abscess may not arise from there. And place another tie outside the first tie, less than two fingers away from it. And after these two ties, leave from the tunica vaginalis, which is under the skin of the scrotum, an amount the size of a finger: and cut the entire remainder along the circumference, and remove the testicle from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the scrotum an incision, from which blood and pus run: as we related in what has been previously stated.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound: and apply the bandage that we have described. And sometimes the white membrane that we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing the flow of blood. For it often happens. And leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling is delayed, then it should be fomented with warm water: and put over it what we have described, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Concerning a varicose vein.
In this varicose vein I have not seen anyone who has dared attempt treatment of it with a knife.
And the first indeed said, that it happens just as we explained in the varicose vein which is with a vine. Which is, that you ligate the vessels after the incision over it easily lower down: then cut in the middle, and afterwards treat with that which opens it, until the vessels fall off: and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
Chapter 67
Regarding the rupture which occurs in the groin.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing of the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all times: but if the time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the peritoneum, until the intestines descend into the peritoneum.
And that happens from the distension of the peritoneum, which is in the groin, as we have said. Which is because the peritoneum is distended: then the place softens, and forms an abscess, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with the cautery, as its description has preceded.
And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this way: and it is, that the patient lies on his back in your hands. Then cut the place of the ruptured abscess and protrusion, cutting across, to the extent of three fingers.
Then compress the fascia and what is under the skin until the white peritoneum, which is under the skin that follows it, is revealed.
Then take the probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum, and press it into the depths of the abdomen.
Then sew the two protruding places of the peritoneum over the end of the probe, and tie them together with a suture; then withdraw the end of the probe.
And do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor stretch the testicle, nor anything else, as I made you aware in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Then treat it by the treatment of wounds. When, therefore, you cut the threads, cleanse it and dress the wound until it heals.
For the peritoneum contracts, and the protrusion of the rupture is not increased.
And cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to a cure.
Chapter 68.
¶ On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Often the skin of the testicles softens in some men, on account of which the flesh between them softens, and their appearance is marred.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to treat it, to make the patient lie on his back, and to cut away all the skin that is softened, down to the natural skin.
Then join the two edges with a suture: and if you wish, first sew the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Then cut between the sutures.
Then treat as with other wounds, until it heals, and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
On Castration.
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and because of that it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine: and mentioning it is not necessary, except for two reasons.
One of which is, that it be within the physician's knowledge when he is asked about it: and that he may know the treatment for one to whom it happens.
And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals, for our benefit from it, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
I say, therefore, that castration is done in two ways. Either by crushing. Or by splitting, and cutting.
In that which is done by crushing, the method of operation is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand, until they dissolve and do not appear to the touch.
In castration by splitting and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory [muscle], and cut over the whole testicle with one cut, until when the two testicles protrude; then incise them after you have skinned each one, and do not leave anything of the membrane on them except the thin membrane, which is on the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, for which reason the animal desires coitus.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 70.
The Treatment of Two Kinds of Hermaphrodites.
A hermaphrodite from men is of two kinds. One of them is because it appears in him that following the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a shape as if the vulva of a woman, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one type, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubic bone like the testicles of a man, quite small, protruding outwards: one of which is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three types, two from men and one type from women, is: that it is necessary to cut the extra flesh until their mark disappears. Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second type of men, however, from which urine comes out, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all for it.
Chapter 71.
¶ On the incision of a swelling, and of flesh protruding in the vulvas of women.
A swelling is perhaps added upon a natural part until its appearance becomes ugly and foul; and sometimes it becomes so enlarged in some women that it stretches out as in men, and becomes suitable for intercourse.
It is necessary, therefore, that you hold the excess of the swelling with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it; and do not go to extremes in the cutting, especially in the depth of the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Now, an arisen flesh is a flesh that grows in the orifice of the womb until it fills it; and sometimes it emerges outside like a tail, and because of that some of the early ones called the ailment "tailed. It is necessary, therefore, that we cut it just as we cut the swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ On the treatment of Alratica, which is the imperforate vulva of a woman.
Chapter 72.
Alratica is when the vulva of a woman is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
The accidental type is from a preceding illness: and this indeed happens either from extra generated flesh, or from a thin membrane, or a thick one: and it occurs either deep in the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps also prevents menstruation.
And knowledge of it comes through examination by a midwife, if the blockage is apparent and near the surface.
But if it is not apparent, then examine it with your fingers, or with a probe.
However, if the blockage is from a thin membrane, and it is near the two labia: then act quickly, and break it.
And you should place small cushions over the two labia.
Then place the index fingers of both your hands together, and the woman should be on her back with her legs spread. Then stretch the two labia firmly until the thin membrane is broken and the blockage is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the area: and the woman should have intercourse every day, so that the area does not close again.
But if the membrane is thick, dense: then you must cut it with a wide scalpel, similar to a myrtle leaf.
If, however, the blockage is made of flesh, then lift it with hooks, and cut it out: and you should have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without burning, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then insert a wide lead tube so that the wound does not close quickly; she should keep it in for a few days.  And apply a dressing of dry linen; then continue the rest of the treatment until she is healed.
And sometimes in the womb a growth of other flesh arises: it is therefore necessary that it be cut out in this way, as long as it is not a cancerous ulcer; for a cancerous ulcer that is in the womb should not be opposed with iron at all.
Chapter 73
Treatment of hemorrhoids, and red swellings and pustules in women's genitals.
Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of the orifices of veins, until much blood flows from them constantly.
When therefore hemorrhoids become chronic, they become swellings: and I have already spoken in the division about their types, and their signs: and I will say here which of them are receptive to treatment, and which are not.
I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the uterus, and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment for it with iron.
However, those of them which are in the orifice of the uterus that are perceptible to the senses, are those which are treated.
It is necessary, therefore, that you place the woman in a cold room. Then stretch the swelling with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then sprinkle on them, at the flow of blood, one of the incisive powders without cauterization: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and things similar to them.
Then let her press her feet against the wall for one hour. Afterwards, lower her into cold water.
But if the flow of blood persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate rinds, and oak galls, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If therefore the bleeding is stopped by this, it is good: and if not, apply cupping glasses to her back, and to her breasts, without scarification.
Then take wool, and submerge it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of plantain, or the juice of acorn branches, that is, acorns, in Pontus wine, and apply it to the place.
When, therefore, the abscess subsides, then treat the area with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth, however, is red, similar to the heads of Alhaase, and is rough in appearance.
It is necessary, therefore, that you incise what appears of it, in the same way that I explained regarding thelil: and treat it until it heals.
Chapter 74.
¶ On the perforation of a fistula which occurs in the uterus.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the uterus, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and pustules, and vesicles, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and hot abscess.
And indeed I have already described all these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the section: it is necessary that I describe in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the uterus, when it is among the abscesses which collect pus, and you want to know how its opening is made with an instrument.
Therefore you must consider. Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its throbbing, and burning, and fever: and you see it become red: if sensation is lost upon it, then do not rush to perforate it: and treat it with that which aids in its maturation, until the acuity of the symptoms subsides.
Then you must have the woman sit on a seat between two benches, and recline, or be supported on her back, and draw her feet towards the lower part of her belly: and let her thighs be spread, and let her place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a suitable bandage for that purpose.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the uterus is dilated.
And it is necessary when you want to administer this instrument, that you determine with the probe the depth of the woman's uterus: so that what enters of the instrument is not more than the depth of the uterus, and injures the patient.
But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you place small cushions on the lining of the uterine depth: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the uterus is prevented: and it is necessary that she place the screw, which runs in the instrument, on the upper side: and that she hold the instrument, and that the assistant turn the screw, until the depth of the uterus is opened.
When therefore the afterbirth appears, and is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft: then it is necessary that you cut it near its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a tent submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the tent, and withdraw the probe into the depth of the uterus.
And place externally on the uterus and on the pubis clean wool submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Then let her be treated after two days with an ointment which is suitable for it, until she is healed.
And sometimes the uterus and the wound are washed, so that it is cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of a lily, or long birthwort, has been boiled: then she should return to the ointment.
But if the wound should be hidden inside in the uterus, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron; rather treat it with what we have described in the chapter.
Chapter Seventy-six.
¶ Obstetrical Teachings, how living embryos, emerging according to an unnatural form, are treated.
It is necessary for the midwife to first recognize the form of a natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman straining downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and what is upon her from the birth is relieved, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then you should know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is on its head, and the afterbirth with it: either suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
For when it descends on its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with a good cleansing.
However, what is beyond this birth, is unnatural, not praiseworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus comes out on its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet, and its hands together, or one of its feet: or its head comes out and its hand: or it comes out prone: and perhaps it is turned on its neck, and similar things from the unpraiseworthy forms.
It is necessary therefore for the obstetrician to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form of them, and how the skill is in it, and it is explained thereby, and attention is paid to it.
When the fetus comes out on its head in its natural way of coming out, and it becomes intense for the woman, and birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength now weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or have women hold her: and fumigate her vulva with boiled fenugreek, and with moist oils.
Then the midwife should insert a small spatula between her fingers, and break the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her fingernail, until what is in it of moisture runs: and press the woman's abdomen, until the fetus descends.
If however it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Then order her, after the enema, that she strain: and make her sneeze with mustard, and hold her mouth and her nose for one hour. For the fetus will come out immediately.
But if the two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you replace them gently and gradually. If however it does not obey in entering, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upward: then shake the seat on the ground: and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If, therefore, the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them off, and extract the rest of the fetus: and tie its hand with a cloth, and extract it evenly: for it will come out.
The exit of the embryo on its feet. When the fetus comes out on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards: then turn the fetus gradually: afterwards adjust it.
Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When, therefore, they come out as far as the hips, then order her to push, and make her sneeze with pepper; for it will come out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out with what we have described, then bring back the fetus gradually, until you place it according to the natural position. For it will then come out with an easy exit.
But if it is prevented after all that we have described: then take some mucilage of marshmallow, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound it all in a mortar with a good pounding: then smear with it the woman's vulva, and the lower part of her belly. Then make her sit in lukewarm water, until it reaches her abdomen.
When therefore you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make for her a pessary of myrrh: and insert it. When therefore the pessary has been held for one hour, then have her sit on a birthing stool. Then make her sneeze: and squeeze her mouth and nose shut: and press the lower part of the belly with a gentle compression. For the fetus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus onto the knees and hands. When it comes out in this manner, then the midwife will contrive in introducing her hands little by little. Then the woman is laid on her back, and her feet hang down: and she lies on the bed, and clasps her hands. Then press on her abdomen little by little. Then withdraw what is under her feet from the pillows, until she is positioned lower down. But if the fetus does not come out, then take her feet, and move them with a vigorous movement. Then press what is above the hypochondria little by little, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts. Then he inserts his hands, and adjusts the fetus little by little: and he tells the woman to push until the fetus comes out.
¶ Delivery of the fetus hanging sideways from the hands. It will be devised in the replacement of her hand. But if he cannot replace it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
But if she cannot walk, then make her lie down on the bed: and shake her legs with a powerful shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you prepared from mucilages.
But if childbirth seizes her, then make her sit on a chair. Then diligently apply your hand in repositioning, and adjust the fetus according to its natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to strain herself, until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus upon its neck, with hands outstretched, and its face is toward the back of its mother. It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus, then turn it little by little, and adjust it gently.
When, therefore, it is adjusted, then place upon her vulva that which we have described of oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to move a little at a time. When, therefore, you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and instruct her to lean towards the right side. Then instruct her to bear down: and make her sneeze with pepper.
The exit of the fetus positioned on its side. When it descends to the opening of the womb in this way with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of fluid.
If, therefore, it hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not held back and dies.
Then push the fetus inwards, until you position it as it should be, and instruct the woman to bear down a few times: for it will come out with an easy exit.
The delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three and four are born. However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Five, indeed, is a thing beyond nature, and they do not live at all, and one afterbirth contains them, however many they may be, and they are separated by membranes, distinguishing between them tied in the umbilical cord of each of them.
And sometimes they come forth just as a single fetus comes forth in a natural, easy delivery, and they come forth in a difficult delivery, as we have described.
But if some of them are difficult during birth and they come to that which we have spoken of concerning unnatural presentations, then treat them as we have described, and let there be a skilled midwife, and let her do what she does with ease and slowness, and she will manage, according to each presentation, with that which is available to her, by her ingenuity leading to a successful outcome.
A reminder of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and are miscarried.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten, are formed in the womb: and it has already been confirmed by my observation that a woman, by miscarrying, expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Which has been made by the measure of the glorious and wise one.
All this, therefore, is necessary for the knowledge of a midwife. For perhaps something similar to that will happen to her: therefore, she should oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the section on medication, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to use a manual operation, then you must consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and not afflicted with any of the conditions from which her demise is feared, then the woman should be laid on her back upon a bed, with her head inclined downwards and her legs raised: and an assistant should hold her on both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body is not pulled off the bed during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the opening of the womb with moist oils, with the mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then insert it into the womb gently. Then with it she should seek the place on the fetus in which to fix the hooks, and suitable places for that.
Consider then, if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and below the hypochondria.
But if the descent is feet first, then in the groin and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand: and insert it with her hand gently, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have mentioned, until it comes to empty space.
Then fix opposite it another hook, or a third, if you need it: so that the traction is equal, and it does not deviate to one side.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be only straight, but rather let it be moved in every direction, so that its exit may be eased: just as is done with a tooth when it is extracted.
And it is necessary in the interval, that the stretching be softened. But if part of it is held back, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil and insert them alongside, so that she may turn out with them what is held back.
Therefore, if part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks should be shifted to another, higher place: do this until the entire fetus comes out.
If, therefore, a hand comes out before anything else, and it is not possible to push it back, because of its confinement, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it. Then pull it until, when it comes out entirely, cut it either at the ankle joint, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you do with the other hand, and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction occurs at the exit, or water has collected in its head, then it is necessary that she insert a thorny spatula between the fingers and pierce the head with it, and extract the water: or break it up with the instrument that is called Almisdac: the form of which comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that is after this.
Similarly, she should do this if the fetus is naturally large-headed; then it is necessary to cut the jaw or pull it out with the misdach, as we have said. Then you should pull the bones with forceps.
But if the head emerges and is constricted at the collarbone, then it should be split until the fluid which is in the chest is released.
But if it is not folded up and does not yield to exit, then cut the head piecemeal, as much as you can.
But if the lower abdomen is abscessed, or there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary to pierce it until the fluid runs out of it.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is uncomplicated.
But if it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped over your hand: and split the belly or chest until what is in them runs out.
But if the other limbs are removed, and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand. Therefore, if the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand deep into the womb, and search with it for the head, and draw it with her fingers up to the mouth of the womb; then insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it out with it.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot abscess which happens to it, then it is not necessary to work on it; rather, it is necessary then to administer a pouring of moist, oily things, and administer plasters, and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it be straightened: then let what we said about the living fetus be administered.
But if that is not possible, then let it be cut up piece by piece, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave nothing of the afterbirth inside at all.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses which occur in the womb.
But if a flow of blood should occur, then let her descend into styptic waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
And I indeed have now seen a woman, in whose womb a fetus had died: then she was impregnated over it another time, afterwards another fetus also died. Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled up until it opened, and began to emit pus.
Therefore I was called to her treatment, and I treated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Therefore I placed over it one of the plasters of strong drawing power, and a bone came out from the place. Then a few days passed for her, and another bone came out. Therefore I marveled at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
I therefore examined the wound, and extracted many bones, with the woman being in better condition, and now she has lived thus for a long time, and discharges a little pus from the place.
And I would not have recorded this strange thing here, except that there is knowledge in it, and help for that which a skilled physician administers with his hand in treatment.
Chapter 77
On the forms of instruments necessary for the extraction of a fetus.
The form of the screw with which the matrix is opened.
Here below is the form of a smoothing tool, with which books are flattened, which has two evenly placed screws at the two ends of two pieces of wood. However, it is necessary that this screw be finer than the smoothing tool: and that it be made either from ebony or boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers: and the edge of both of them should be about one finger, and the length of each of them a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it is opened with them when you turn the two screws.
Another form similar to that one, finer, and lighter.
Let it be made from ebony or boxwood, in the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition of them is about a handspan: and the width of each is two fingers.
When, therefore, you want to open the womb with it, then have the woman sit upon a bed, with her feet hanging down, that which is between her legs opened. Then insert these two additions joined together into the womb: and you are holding the extremity of the instrument below between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount you want from the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
The form of another scoop which the ancients called the Impeller, by which the fetus is expelled.
The form of the Almisdac, by which a large head is crushed: and it is similar to forceps, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
And sometimes it is made oblong, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it is cut and crushed.
Form of a hook having one point.
Form of a hook having two points.
The form of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Form of two spatulas, also broad.
All these instruments are practiced, and the more their types are multiplied, and are prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the higher in esteem among men, because of their quantity.
Therefore you should not disregard any of these instruments, but have it prepared and at hand. For the need of them is unavoidable.
Chapter 78.
On the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you must instruct the weak woman to hold her breath. Then make her sneeze with spices: and press your hand over her mouth, and her nostrils. If, therefore, it comes out by this means, that is good.
If not: then take a pot, and make a hole in the lid: and put in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and black cumin, and cassia bark, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and place them over a fire.
Then place a tube of reed over the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb: and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the hollow of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said. For the afterbirth will come out easily.
However, if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to submerge her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then insert it into the vulva, and search with it for the afterbirth. When she has found it, then she should grasp it, and draw it out little by little.
But if it is attached deep in the womb, then insert the hand, as we have described, until the afterbirth is found, and extract it little by little straightforwardly, so that the womb does not fall out with strong pulling: rather, it should be shifted easily to the right and left sides; then increased pulling force should be added. For it will then yield, and be preserved, and be freed from adhesion.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already explained: treat it with sneezing, and by medicating the pot with herbs.
But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire her out by repeatedly pulling.
Rather, what comes out of it to the mouth of the womb you should tie to the woman's thigh. Then apply an enema to her with tetrapharmacon ointment. For this will rot it after a few days, and it will dissolve, and come out.
However, when it rots, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and this harms the weak woman. Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered for this.
Indeed, some of the ancients already tried fumigation of watercress and dried figs.
Form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of the afterbirth and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to an alembic, or of clay: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation material be placed on the coals: let her hold it until that fumigation material is consumed: and repeat with another.
Chapter 79.
On the treatment of an imperforate anus.
Many children are born whose anuses are not perforated, which a thin membrane has obstructed. It is therefore necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger: and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp scalpel: and let her beware of the muscle, lest she touch it.
Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if you fear that it may close up, then place in the opening a small tube of lead for many days, and let it be removed when the child wishes to defecate.
And indeed blockage of the anus also occurs from the healing of a wound, or of an abscess. It is necessary therefore that that healed tissue be cut, then treated with what we have said concerning the treatment and the lead.
Chapter 80.
On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a knotting and swelling that occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one of the parts: and it is one fistula, or several.
When therefore that knot hardens, it is opened, and a watery white fluid, or thin pus, flows out from it.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating. Therefore, penetrating fistulas are recognized by what comes out with excrement and flatulence, when the patient has a bowel movement: and perhaps worms come out of them.
And some of these fistulas, when they are deep, penetrate to the bladder and to the urethra. And some of them penetrate as far as the hip joint, and to the tailbone.
Moreover, how a penetrating fistula to the anus is distinguished from one that is not penetrating is that you insert your index finger into the anus: and you insert a thin probe of bronze, or iron, into the fistula: when there is no crookedness.
But if there is crookedness in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe, or the hair, with your finger.
But if you do not feel it deeply, and nothing of the excrement, nor flatulence, nor a worm, as I said, comes out of the opening, then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to the treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary meatus, then the sign of it is the discharge of urine from it, and its prevention from closing up by means of medicines.
But if it penetrates to the hip joint, or to the hip bone, then the sign of it is that the probe reaches there, if there is no crookedness in it as far as the bone: and the finding of pain around the area, and that pus always comes out of it: and that medication is not effective on it, nor is it closed up with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and their treatment is labor and vanity for that one of the foolish physicians, upon whom it is practiced.
But in that which is not penetrating, and not old, healing is hoped for with the saw: according to what I describe to you, and I have already tested: and it is that the patient lies on his back in your hands: and raise his legs up above his thighs, and let his thighs be inclined towards his belly. Then insert a probe of lead, or bronze, if there is crookedness in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
But if the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If, therefore, you feel in your finger the probe having now penetrated by itself exposed, except that you feel between your finger and it a membrane, or flesh: then you should know for certain that it is penetrating: therefore do not work on it, because there is no healing of it, as we have said.
However, they have said that in some men the flesh is healed, and from the medication by which help is hoped for it, that you should heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as preceded, and insert it, heated, into the fistula, until it reaches near the anus. Then repeat this twice, or three times, until you know that now all those added, filtered, fleshy parts, which are like the quill of a bird's feather, have been burned.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those fleshy parts that have been burned come out: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it is never healed by any other treatment.
And if the probe comes out, and does not reach as far as your finger, which is in the anus, and there is a thick fleshy covering between it and the probe, or similar: and you see a fistula in what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go on cutting with the probe what is in the fistula, until the cut reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered fleshy parts, which are like the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing of them remains.
If, however, the blood overcomes you, and prevents you from performing your operation to cut those fleshy parts: then the best thing to be done, and the quickest relief, is to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Because cautery with fire combines good qualities, the burning of those additional fleshy parts, and the stopping of blood, and the drying of moisture.
Then treat it with linen bandages soaked in butter, or crushed cabbage, until the place emits pus, and those burnt fleshy parts come out in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, generating hard flesh: and these are medicines in which there are styptic and drying qualities.
For when they are restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula now reaches to the depth of the anus, and is extended from the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and examine with it.
If therefore you feel a tent, and between you and it there is a covering of peritoneum, or flesh, and it is close to penetrating: then there is no operation in that case, except by way of confidence and hope.
Which is, because one of three methods is administered in this case: either cauterize it, as we have said: or cut it until you reach its cavity, so that it is possible for you to insert pledgets, and the cure closely follows. And do not proceed much with the cutting, so that you do not incise the muscle containing the anus, and involuntary defecation happens to the patient. Then treat it with what we have said.
For perhaps it will heal: or peel away the covering, and clean it after you cut it up close to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe, or with another sharp-pointed instrument. Then cleanse the filtered flesh which are in the incision, as far as you can by probing.
Then attempt restoration of the whole wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it closes: and the fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is sewn in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a cobbler's needle, that is, of those who prepare hides, in this form. And insert into it a thread rolled up from five strands, and about that many. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its cavity.
If, therefore, it penetrates inside the margin of the anus nearby, then draw the thread out of that hole: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and draw out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and tighten both, and leave it for one day, or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those flesh parts which are between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall off: then treat the wound until it closes and heals.
If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way is available to you, unless it is very deep. For you are not able to do it because of the muscle, so that you do not cut it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the pointed spatula with which the fistula is split, the curvature of which is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter 81.
On suturing hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids exist in two forms. For either they are inside the anus, like blisters from coals or like plums, or as if they are themselves like grapes. And of these, some are small and some large: and blood flows from them continuously, and there is one, and there are many. And they are outside the anus and on its edges.
However, these which are outside the anus are for the most part with little moisture, from which runs yellow fluid, or a little blood with constant flow: and they have the color of flesh.
And the treatment for the one that is inside the anus is that you instruct the patient to strain: and push until the anus protrudes, and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Therefore then, either suspend them with hooks or grasp them with your fingernail. Then cut them at their roots.
But if the hooks do not hold them, because of their moisture and softness, then grasp them with a rough cloth, or with a piece of folded wool, and pull them out with your fingers. Then cut them, and sprinkle on them after the cutting some hot powders, so that they stand in place of cautery. Or cauterize them according to what was stated previously in the chapter on cauterizing. Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
But if the anus does not obey expulsion, then give the patient an enema in which there is a little irritant, so that it washes with that which is in the anus, and obeys expulsion quickly, when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their situation is mild, easy: and it is that you take them with your fingernail, or you take them with a hook, and cut them. Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever shrinks from incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer stitching of them according to this manner. Take a wrapped thread and insert it into a needle. Then draw the hemorrhoid upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be widthwise: and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong tightening. Then knot the thread and withdraw the needle.
Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: nor sew it up, so that excess blood may flow from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or oil of carrots, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest. Then leave it until it falls off.
When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and other treatment until they are healed.
On the treatment of fissures. For they often occur from dryness of the feces and constipation of the bowels.
When therefore they become chronic, and medicine is of no avail in them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper layer of skin which prevents them from healing is removed. Then treat them until they heal as they should.
But if they do not heal, then repeat the procedure with stronger scraping than the first, until they bleed profusely and the skin is removed; then treat them until they are healthy.
On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and of dry Athelil, and Formica.
Chapter 82
Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round lump, the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs all over the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and pain from them occurs when walking.
It is therefore necessary that what is around the nail be cut, and held with forceps, or with a hook, and eradicated from its root.
Then treat it: and if you wish, cauterize it as described previously in its chapter.
Of the dry athelil, one is a small, rough, threadlike, round eminence on the surface of the body. And they often occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is that you stretch the athelil, and cut it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with a hair, until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it as described before with fire, or with a sharp medicine: and now inverted and non-inverted athelil are eradicated with the instrument that I will describe.
A formica, however, is also a small, threadlike, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when cold finds it, something like the bite of an ant is felt in it, and it occurs in the whole body: and most of them occur on the hands.
And its treatment is that you take a small tube from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather: and place that small tube over the formica, so that the circle of the small tube contains its borders. Then turn your hand with the small tube until you cut what is around the formica: and place it deep in the flesh, and root out the formica from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a small tube of bronze, or iron, according to this form.
Let the top of the small tube, tapering to a blunt, rounded point, be high so that the gripping and turning of it on the finger may be made easier.
And if you wish, cauterize the formica according to what was stated previously about the cauterization of athelil in the chapter on cautery.
Chapter 83.
On the forms of instruments that are used for clysters in diseases of the anus, and loosening of the bowels, and colic.
Sometimes a syringe is made from silver, or from brass, or from cast or hammered bronze.
And sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those in whom they are employed.
Therefore, that which is used in the treatment of small children should be small: and for those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too should their syringes be.
Large syringe.
Its tube, that is, the upper end where the bladder is tied, should be wide in this manner: and let it have a distinction so that the bladder can be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, very much so, tapering subtly: and on one of its sides let there be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the radii, and a little thicker, and let the bag into which medicines are placed be made from an animal bladder or from sheep parchment, which should be in the shape of a small waterskin: whose neck should be one palm [in length].
And let it be pierced with many holes as it is rolled up, and let the space that is between each hole be the thickness of a finger. Then insert into those holes strong thread made of raw silk, which consists of ten threads, or about that many, and gather the bladder with it like a waterskin. Therefore, when the bladder is placed on it, let it be tightened on the head of the clyster between two separating bands with a strong constriction. Then administer an enema with it.
And this is the form of the circle of the bladder depicted here, and of the holes.
The way to administer an enema with it is this: fill the bladder or bag with the medication, warmed according to what the patient can tolerate: and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then the patient should lie on his back and raise his legs upwards; and place underneath him an inthaan, that is, a hide on which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances. Then insert it into the anus gently. Then the assistant should take the bag with both hands together, and squeeze it firmly until he has emptied all that is in the clyster into the intestine.
Then withdraw the clyster, and the patient should raise his legs against the wall.
But if the medicine urges him to defecate, then he should hold it as long as he can. And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more beneficial in the extreme.
But if you give him a clyster in cases of diarrhea, and it is expelled quickly, then repeat the clyster until he is cured.
But if there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or harmful abscesses, then the clyster should be very thin, mild, of the sort given to children.
And this is the recipe for a thin clyster for chapped skin.
Chapter 84.
I have already said in the section on the treatment of wounds what was appropriate for the book, and I will describe here their treatment manually and with medicines, in full.
I say, therefore, that wounds are classified according to that with which the wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
The things with which wounds are often made are such as the throwing of a stone, or the cut of a sword, or a knife, or a blow with a lance, or wood, or an arrow, and similar things, of which there are many.
The wounds that occur according to the locations of the body are like a wound that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar limbs among them.
And I am describing the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may establish that reasoning and rule regarding the other wounds.
And I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, since the discussion of compound [wounds] will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore. When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and it has already broken only the skin: and the wound is large, and you fear for the sick person the outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and immediately phlebotomize the cephalic vein: and do not delay it: and draw blood from him according to the amount of his strength: if there is nothing preventing phlebotomy, especially if the blood which comes out of the wound is little. And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part. And let the sick person beware of fullness, and wine, and gross foods.
But if something prevents bloodletting, then let him be reduced in food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And put on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in it, cotton infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
But if you are safe from a hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I will describe shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then put certain ointments on it until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from the cut of a sword, and similar things: and its lips are not brought together by small compresses, then bring them together with a suture, according as I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their suturing.
But if the wound is already exposed from the bone, and hangs, and there is no holding it except in a small sling: then cut it off. Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh in it in place of skin, and instruct the patient that he be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge: and similar things.
But if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut away all the putrefaction, and discard it: then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate above the artery. If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a scalpel, or tie it off. But if necessity compels when what we have said is not effective, then cauterize it, until the blood flow is stopped.
But if these wounds are small, simple, then their matter is easy, light: so that you sprinkle on them this powder: because it consolidates them before the air changes them.
The Method of Incarnating Powder. Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: let the whole be ground much, and sifted: and let the wound be filled with it, and bound with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it, and clots with the blood.
Then compress it from above with small cushions, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it is not dislodged. For the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood present; it also performs the same function in many large wounds, when it is appropriate that it be placed on them and they be bound, and they are fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
But if the air has already altered them somewhat, especially when it is in the summer season, then the intention of placing this powder is not [appropriate]: therefore treat it with what we have said, so that you place certain digestive ointments on them: or place on them poultices of barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus. Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then remove it with Gesti: and I will now discuss the treatment of fractures of the head in what is to come.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a wound of the head when it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except that its treatment is avoided with that which causes strong astringency, like vitriol, and alum, and similar things. Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
And do not place anything cold at all upon the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and their connection is with the brain, which is the highest of the limbs: and let that with which it is treated be mild from among medicines, such as lime washed with fresh water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when also washed with fresh water: and the other mineral stones, according to this manner, and moist ointments.
If, however, the wound is large, then administer a suture: or draw together its lips with small cushions. Then treat it until it is healed.
But if the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in it in its lower part, in which pus is now collected, then perforate it in the most depressed place in it.
But if an artery has already been cut in the wound, and a flow of blood from it has followed: then separate, or cut it, and tie it off: or cauterize it, if necessity compels you to that.
But if the vertebrae of the throat, or the whole, has already been cut, and the cervical arteries are safe, then join the lips of the skin with a suture over the tube of the throat, and do not touch the throat, rather level it, and bring it back to its natural shape. Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days. Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties, until it is healed.
But if the wound has already made an impression in the bone, then examine it: then if there are bone fragments in it, extract them all, or as many as you can: and what cannot be removed, leave it until the wound putrefies, and it separates and its exit is facilitated.
But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder which I have described. But if bone is visible in the wound, and a fistula develops: then treat it with that which was mentioned in its chapter.
Regarding a wound in the shoulder blades.
If there is a piercing by a lance, or a knife: and you see its depth, then consider [it]. If, therefore, air comes out of the wound when the patient breathes from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder in it at the first hour, nor bandage it tightly, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the patient: but put in it a drawing ointment, and loosen it twice a day.
But if you do not have ointment at hand, then put old cotton in the opening of the wound, so that it absorbs the fluids that come out of it: and have the patient sleep on the wound, so that what collects in it will drain.
If, however, three or more days have already passed since the wounding, and the patient does not experience spasms, nor a bad heart tremor, nor tightness in breathing, and you see his other dispositions are good: then know that the wound is safe. Therefore treat it with bandages and other treatment until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it is always open, then know that it has become a fistula. Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from the cut of a sword, or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest, or the back, then treat it with what was described previously concerning sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression in the bone, and pieces of it have been cut off, then examine the wound, and hasten to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction will be easier.
The judgment in the treatment of the remaining accidental wounds in the other limbs is the judgment of what we have said.
Concerning wounds of the belly, and the protrusion of the intestine, and their treatment.
The rupture which happens to the belly is large, and medium, and small.
From the large one, therefore, sometimes the intestine comes forth, or a number of intestines.
Therefore, their insertion is made, and their stitching more intense and more difficult.
And the small rupture also becomes difficult in another way. It follows, therefore, that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hurry in their insertion to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and enlarged: wherefore its entry becomes difficult.
On account of this, therefore, the middle rupture of ruptures becomes better: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not made difficult, as it is made difficult in these two types.
Know that the suturing of the penis is according to four methods.
Two common sutures are suitable in the suturing of the belly, and in the suturing of the other wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly pertain to other wounds. Nevertheless they are more appropriate with the suturing of the belly: and I will describe each one to you with an explanation and clarification.
I say, therefore, that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine protrudes from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of two reasons. Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said: or because in the intestine there is swelling because of the coldness of the air.
When, therefore, it is so, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a damp cloth, in lukewarm water only. Or boil camel grass, and cyperus, and lavender, in water, and foment the intestine with it, until the swelling is resolved.
Sometimes wine, in which there is astringency, does that: and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
When, therefore, you see the swelling now resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled. For by that its return is made easier with little trouble.
But if its return is hindered after this treatment, then make a small cut at the rupture, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than cutting: and there is no pressure to cut after the need and lack of the instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the thin end not be as thin as a spatula, but rather a little blunter: and this is the one that resembles a lancet, as you see.
When, therefore, the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that it be returned according to its natural form to its proper place, if that is possible: because it is better.
When, however, the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly, then you must make the patient lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head. And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly if the rupture is on one of the two sides of the belly, then direct your attention and your consideration always to this, that the part in which the wound is located be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary that you manage this in large wounds and in middling wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then ensure that a devout assistant is present between your hands, who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and brings together its lips. Then uncover from it for him who follows, for the stitching, something after something: and this is the method of a single common stitch.
And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the amount of wideness of the wound. Then leave from the edge of the rupture the amount of a ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle besides which you insert into it thread at the two edges of the skin, with the two edges of the membrane which is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together the two edges of the skin, and the two edges of the membrane: and four layers are made.
Then tie with a double thread around the needle a few times from both sides at the same time, until the two lips of the wound are joined together in a suitable union.
Then leave the width of a finger again, and fix in them another needle: afterwards thread it with thread, just as you did with the first needle. Therefore do not cease doing that with what you need of needles, until you complete the binding of the entire wound.
And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: because very thin needles cut the flesh too quickly: and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin: because of that it is necessary that they be medium in thinness, and thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted at the two very near edges of the skin: so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound opens before its closing, and they should not be elongated with the suture either, so that the wound is not prevented from closing.
Then cut off the ends of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient during his sleep: and place pads of cloth on them on all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles: and leave them until you know that the wound is now healed.
And indeed this type of stitching with needles is thus more suitable in small wounds. Since one needle, or two, or about that many, suffices for stitching them.
The second stitch however is common, that you join together with stitching the four edges: two edges of skin, and two edges of the peritoneum in one place, with a needle in which there is an evenly wrapped thread of equal fineness and thickness.
Then when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, bring the needle back through the side from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitch is like the stitching of cloth with which cloths are fastened, and put between every stitch the width of the little finger.
And indeed men know this stitch.
And with this stitch I myself sewed a wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was larger than a handspan: and about two handspans of the middle intestine had come out of his intestines, and the rupture was in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I returned it after his intestine remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound healed in a period of about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived after that for many years, attending to his affairs.
And the doctors had judged that he would not be healed.
And it was a marvel, that I did not treat it with ointment. Because I was in a place in which neither ointment nor any medicines were found. Therefore I placed old cotton on the wound twice a day, and I continued washing it with honey water, until it was healed.
I will describe two particular types of suture according to the account of the discourse.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
When, therefore, the needle penetrates the skin and into the muscle going along the length and width of the entire body: release the end of the thread on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate at the other end from the inner part to the outer part at the other end of the wound.
When, therefore, you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate likewise at the same end of the wound from the outside to the inside: and release the end of the thread which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate at the other end from the inside to the outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration which you make it penetrate into the thread at the end of the wound, which is on its side, until it penetrates it completely.
Then also begin from this same side, and sew it with the end, which is of the thread on the other side, and draw the needle out from the skin which it penetrated.
Then bring it back into that skin, and sew the end of the thread, which is on the other side, with this end of the wound: and draw it out from the skin which is on its side, and do that one time after another: and do that time after time, until you sew the whole outside according to that example.
And the gist of this suture is that you sew with the suture of furriers with which they sew skins: so that you sew the thread one time on one side at the edge of the skin: and that you release it another time on the other side, until you complete it.
The second type of proper suture, which Galen described.
This is his narrated speech, that you sew it according to the likeness with which certain healers sew them, so that they join every part to its matching corresponding part by nature: and apply the end of the thread to its other end, and the end of the wound to its other end. And that is done according to what I tell you.
It is necessary that you fix the needle at the edge of the wound near you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part in that place only: and leave the two ends of the thread. Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner part into the two ends of the thread, that is, on both sides.
Then turn both, also make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other ends of the wound, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of stitching is better than the common easy stitch, and it is the stitch previously mentioned.
This is also the opinion of Galen.
And some said. The belly suture is repaired with two needles. Which is, that you insert a single thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from the part that is near you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the stitching of those who sew hides evenly.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suturing is more difficult than that of other places of the belly.
The treatment of a wound, however, is the same as that of other wounds.
Which is, that when you find a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it: and you replace the intestine, and sew it, and dress it: then you put on incarnative powder.
But if the air has already altered the wound: then put on it some ointments, which are at hand, until they produce pus: and the threads fall out, and the tissues and membranes consolidate. Then treat it like the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
But if you do not have medicines available, then put on it immediately, as soon as it begins to emit pus, old cotton: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
For you do not need other medication in most cases, when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members in the injury, then you should submerge soft wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and place it around the areas which are between the groin and under the armpits.
But if he feels pain, or pricking sensations, or putrefaction in his intestines (for that often happens) then give him an enema with warm, dark, astringent wine: especially if the putridity has already reached the intestine, and is about to break out, penetrating to its cavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is easier to heal, and that which is from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
However, the intestine which is called the jejunum does not at all admit of healing from a wound which occurs in it; and that is because of the multitude of its veins and their size, and because of the thinness of its substance, and the closeness of its nature to that of nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is omentum, and you come upon it fresh, replace it according to your method of reduction, by which you reduce intestines uniformly.
But if some time has passed for it, and it has already become green or black, then you must tie it off with thread above the part of it that has blackened, so that a flow of blood does not occur. For in the omentum are veins and arteries.
Then cut off what is beyond that ligature, and place the two hanging ends of the thread from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so that the pulling on it, and the drawing of it out in the event of sloughing of the omentum, and the discharge of pus from the wound, may be made easier for you.
A note concerning a wound which occurs in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small, then it is possible for it to be restored in some men: because I saw someone who had been wounded in his belly by being struck with a spear, and the wound was on the right of the stomach, and the wound became chronic, and a fistula formed, and excrement and flatulence came out of it.
Therefore I applied treatment until I was certain of his healing: nor did I cease to attend carefully to it until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the patient that some bad accident would happen in his belly: and no bad accident happened to him from it. And he remained in the best of health, eating and drinking, and having sexual intercourse, and entering the bath, and exercising himself in his diet.
And now some of the experienced have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this way. And it is thus: that you take ants with large heads. Then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one of the ants, having its jaws open, over the two lips of the wound. When, therefore, it bites onto it and clenches its jaws, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not come loose.
Then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the size of the whole wound.
Then replace it, and sew up the wound. For those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm at all happens to the patient.
And now it is possible to sew up the intestine even with a thin thread: which is taken from the gut of an animal, attached to the needle after it is threaded.
And you should take the end of this thread from the intestine, and remove much of the flesh. Then tie at its end a thin, wrapped linen thread. Then thread that gut thread onto the needle and sew the intestine with it. Then return it into the rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to a path of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no skill except making it smaller, nor is its healing complete.
Concerning the treatment of headaches and fistulas.
Know that every wound, or abscess when it becomes old and ages, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated, and always emits pus, and is not cut off: then it is universally called in whatever limb it may be, a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula indeed is according to truth a filtered knot, hard, white: with which there is no pain, which has the hollowness of a bird's feather: and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And at certain times it is moist, which emits pus. And perhaps the moisture is cut off at certain times. And sometimes this moisture is much, and it is little: and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I already stated in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer that is not healed, nor does flesh grow in it, is not that except because of one of nine causes.
One of which is, either because of a lack of blood in the body: or because of its bad quality: or because between it, and on its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because there is much filth and dirt: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is sent to it is of poor quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment: or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of plague, or by a property in the region, as happens in Zaragoza: in which the digestion of illnesses becomes difficult, and the healing of abscesses by nature is slowed in it: or because there is one bone in it, or a number of bones.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all the members of the body. For among them are Fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or peritoneum: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs: or to some of the vertebrae of the back, or to some of the joints formed by composition: such as the hand, and the foot: and among them are those that go to the vicinity of a principal member, and similar things.
Therefore, of these Fistulas, the one that is according to this manner, is among the illnesses difficult to heal, and it does not receive a cure, and dealing with it is labor and ignorance.
But if there is any of the Fistulas whose depth does not reach these places that I have spoken of: and you hope, and you trust in its cure, and you want to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe made of bronze, or iron, if the Fistula extends in a straight line, and examine it with it.
If, however, there is tortuosity in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe of thin lead. Because lead, due to the softness of its substance, is easily bent, and curves around the tortuosity.
But if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to investigate it with a probe. Therefore, inject an enema into one of its openings.
For the liquid with which you inject it will go toward the other openings and run out of them.
Then inquire diligently in whatever way possible for you to learn whether a bone or nerve is there, and whether the cavity of the fistula is deep or shallow: or whether it is a single fistula with many openings, and consider all of this with the greatest care, with your questioning of the patient, and by finding the pain upon compressing with your hand on the area, and by similar signs and causes pertaining to an abscess.
When, therefore, you have considered all these things carefully, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and you should consider then, if the fistula is superficial and obvious, or in a safe place away from a joint, or a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you about: then cut open the fistula according to what I have explained previously, and remove what is in it from fluid and corrupted flesh that grows in its opening, or a fleshy growth, and such things: and treat it until it heals.
But if the fistula is deep and straight, then you ought to cut it open as deeply as possible. Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply tents soaked in sharp medicines and insert them into the cavity of the fistula that you reached with the instrument; do this repeatedly, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains of corruption in the cavity of the fistula.
Then treat it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
If, however, it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have described.
If, therefore, the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of it, then locate it and cut it as I have described to you, if nothing prevents you such as a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
If, therefore, bone is revealed to you, and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all of its corruption is removed. Then treat it with that which causes it to form flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed, and emits pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again, and carefully scrape and clean it with all your strength.
Then treat it again. So if it heals, that is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is deep in the body, which you have not reached. Therefore, you have no choice but to leave it to nature.
But if a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, extract it with fine forceps suitable for it.
But if there are many bones, then carefully extract them all, and do not leave any of them behind, with all your strength.
But if some of the fluids give you trouble, and there is no fear or risk of error in cutting them: then cut those fluids and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then place on the wound something that will rot it: and leave it until what is around those bones, of flesh and fluids, rots.
And take care that the wound does not heal. And the incision that you made in your operation should be constricted. Rather, place on it, if you are concerned, a plug soaked in ground sulfur with oil: or a plug soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those fluids, namely, rot, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is made easier.
But if it is a single large bone, such as the shin bone or the hip bone, and similar to them, and what is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the last scraping, until that blackness and corruption is removed. Then restore the wound.
But if what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it entirely up to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it heals.
And I tell you a case which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may consider it an example and aid in your work.
There was a young man of about thirty years of age, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause that was stirred up within his body, that is, from the internal organs, until the matters reached the leg, and it abscessed with a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Therefore, time passed with him with the error of the physicians, until the abscess opened, and much matter collected with it. And its treatment was postponed, until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus, and bodily fluids.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no skilled hand among them in the art, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matters which flowed from those openings in a great stream: also, the man's entire body was now wasted away, and his color was jaundiced.
I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them reaching each other from all parts of the leg.
I hastened, therefore, and cut over one of those openings, until I uncovered part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was now corroded, and blackened, and putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated all the way to the marrow.
I therefore sawed what was revealed to me and prepared from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone but that corruption, which I cut away and sawed off. And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines over a long period. And it did not heal.
Then I probed, and uncovered the bone a second time, beyond the first uncovering, and I found corruption continuous with the bone, and I sawed off what appeared to me also of that corruption.
Then I attempted its restoration. And it was not restored.
Therefore I uncovered it again, and I did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration, and it was not restored, until I cut away about one palm's width of bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and healed; and this repetition in its operation and its cutting was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the patient's weakness, and his low tolerance, and my fear for him of death, since in every hour, because of excessive evacuation, he was affected by bad fainting spells.
Therefore he was healed with a complete healing, and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and the condition of his body became good, and his strength returned, and he returned to his normal state, and the injury caused him no difficulty at all in walking.
If, however, a protruding bone in a place of the body has already been fractured, then you must saw it, in this way: namely, you should take a cord and tie it at the end of the protruding bone, and tell someone to pull it upwards; and place another cord of wool, thicker than the first cord. Then tie it over the flesh which is under the bone, and extend its end so that you draw the flesh downwards, and you expose the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood, or a board, suitably under the bone below: because when you do this, it is not prevented from cutting the diseased flesh.
And the sawing must be a little above the diseased place, so that the disease is not in the hollow of the bone and does not appear to the senses in its appearance, and forces another sawing in its place.
But if the bone is diseased, and is not protruding, but rather a part of it is continuous with a part, and the disease is in the middle of it, or in a part of it, then completely expose all the flesh from all sides. Then place the wood underneath.
Afterwards, saw it from the first side, where the disease is, until the sawing joins from the other side: and the sawing should be lengthwise, a little away from the disease, as we have said.
But if the disease is in the joint, cut the diseased joint itself, and saw the bone where it joins from the other side.
But if the disease is at the junction of two joints, then there is no remedy for it except scraping.
But if the disease is in the back of the hand or the back of the foot, then the matter is very difficult. Truly it is necessary that you examine how the corruption appears to you. And scrape it, and clean it in whatever way possible for you, and with whatever means you can correct it: when neither a vein nor a nerve opposes you.
And know that there are many incisors and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their thinness, and their size, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their softness. Therefore, it is necessary for you to prepare for each type of operation the instrument appropriate to that operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long experience. And knowledge of the methods of this art [is] a guide to the types of diseases: for then you will find for yourself what is suitable from the instruments for every illness.
And I will establish for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will place [as] examples on which you will operate, and by testing which you will experiment on others.
The Shape of Another Saw.
The shape of a scraper for joints. Let the head of this scraper be according to the shape of the head of a star-shaped nail, and its points be according to the shape of the points of a scarifier.
And it is not suitable, except that the heads of joints be rubbed with it, when they are corrupted, or the bone is broad and large.
The shape of a larger scraper.
The shape of a broad scraper.
The shape of a scraper in which there is a concavity.
The shape of another slender scraper.
The shape of another scraper with a curved end.
The shape of a small, slender, probing scraper.
This resembles a spoke, and the end is like a saw: it is shown in many places from the scraping of bones.
The shape of a scraper which is suitable for the scraping of that which has been perforated from the bones.
Its triangular end has sharp points.
It is made of Indian steel. And similarly it is necessary that all things that we have mentioned be made of scrapers, and incisors, and saws.
On the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
The extremities putrefy, either from an extrinsic cause or an intrinsic one.
When therefore you have treated that corruption with a cure of medicines, and the treatment is not effective: and you see the corruption encroaching upon the limb, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you incise that limb up to where the corruption follows, so that the patient may escape death through this, or from an evil which is greater than the loss of the limb.
And the sign for the one to whom this happens, is that the limb blackens, until it seems that fire has burned it, or it putrefies after the blackness: until that putridness is incised up to that which follows that limb, and creeps into the whole body.
Therefore hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the bite of certain venomous creatures: such as a sea scorpion, and a viper, and a lizard, and similar ones.
If, therefore, the corruption, or bite, is at the extremity of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not give space for the corruption to proceed to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it occurs in the hand, then incise it from the base of the forearm, and do not give space for the corruption, until it takes hold in the forearm.
And if it invades it, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint.
But if the corruption spreads beyond, and you see it around the elbow, then in that case is the death of the patient. And to administer treatment beyond that, is [just] a question of how much strength [remains].
And do likewise with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then incise it at one of the joints: and if it takes hold in the instep of the foot, then incise the whole foot. But if it rises to the knee, then incise the leg at the knee joint.
But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy in it, except to stop treatment, and leave the patient to death.
And the way of incising a limb, or sawing it, is that you tie a ligature below [the place] which you want to incise: and tie another ligature above the place. And let an assistant stretch one ligature downwards: and let another assistant stretch the other ligature upwards. And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed. Then let it be incised, or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw does not touch a healthy place: lest additional injury and a hot abscess befall the patient.
But if internal bleeding occurs while you are operating, then quickly cauterize the area, or place upon it some blood-stanching powders. Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I tell you that this same incident that I am telling you happened to a man in his foot.
Which is, that blackness occurred in his foot, with a burning similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it began to encompass the entire foot.
Therefore the man himself hastened, after he saw the corruption attacking the limb with its vehemence, which he experienced from its pain and burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and was healed.
And after a long time had passed, that same corruption occurred in the index finger of his hand.
Therefore he came to me, and I tried to treat that excess with medicines which I placed on his hand after cleansing his body: and the excess was not repelled, and began to proceed into another finger, until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore he called me, to cut off his hand: and I did not want to do it, hoping for myself to repel that excess: and I also feared death for him from the cutting off of his hand. Because the man's constitution was prone to accidents/misfortunes.
After, therefore, he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and news reached me concerning him, that he hurried and cut off his entire hand: and was healed.
And I did not include this story, except that it might be helpful concerning that which occurs of this kind of disease: and that it might be a sign by which it is signified, and according to which one should act.
¶ On the treatment of sinuses, and the method of administering enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members, and the duration of the abscess is prolonged, until it produces a collection of pus: then it ruptures, or is perforated, and what is in it of pus comes out, and an empty space remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like cloth which has already been thinned: and it does not reach the deepest point in its corruption, nor does it penetrate to the bone, nor to a nerve, nor to a ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however if its duration is prolonged, until the corruption penetrates to one of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is, that you cut that whole skin as it rolls back: and especially when it has been thinned, and made like cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin adheres, and that ultimate consequence of corruption does not follow from it: and if there is thickness from flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema: and that is, that you administer it to the sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then administer an enema to it with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and verdigris, taking equal parts, they are combined in a vessel: and they are boiled over a fire, until the medicine reddens: and it comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take of it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and administer it as an enema to the sinus: and bind its opening, and leave the medicine in it for a period of two hours.
Then extract it by squeezing: do this for many days, until the sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed.
And sometimes it is treated with an enema of ash-water, when this medication is not available to you: and it is done by taking the ash of vine wood, or ash from oak wood: and you pour water over it. Then strain it, and administer it as an enema, until you are sure that the sinus has been washed.
But if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash-water, then administer an enema with water and honey, to which some crushed ginger has already been mixed. Or administer an enema to him with honey and wine mixed together, since it is a property of honey to cleanse and wash: and wine makes the sinus contract, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
When you do this several times, and you are sure that the putrefaction of the sinus has now been removed, then administer to him an enema with that which generates flesh in it.
And you should take some of the diafinicon plaster and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or administer an enema with some other medicines and ointments, whose properties I have described in the treatise on ointments.
But if the orifice of the sinus is narrow, so that the enema cannula cannot enter, then widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place in it some linen soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is widened.
And similarly, if the orifice is too wide, then bring together its edges with a suture: and leave an opening of such a size that the enema can enter without difficulty.
And similarly if its opening, from which the pus flows, is elevated, then cut it in the lowest place on it, so that the pus flows down from there: because when the pus is held deep within the sinus, it prevents flesh from generating within.
But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus near its bottom as you wish, then endeavor to prepare the limb in such a way that the pus may flow out easily, as you deem suitable. Endeavor that no pus at all be retained in it, and take consolidating medications that are put on the mark, suitable for that which you desire. And spread them on a linen cloth. And let the cloth be of such a size that it makes contact with the whole sinus. Then cut with scissors, opposite the opening of the sinus, a hole a little larger than the opening of the sinus. Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it on top, positioned away from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it is eased, and do not remove the large cloth except after a few days at a time.
But the one that is over the opening of the sinus, this is the one that you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from the pus may come out, and so that you know whether the discharge that flows from it is much or little, or healthy or unhealthy.
And with this, again examine the location of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is no abscess in it.
When therefore your treatment is extended in this way, and you see matter that comes out over the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus now adheres, or is close to adhering.  Then therefore loosen it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you loosen the wound, then exchange for another cloth, and renew the ointment.
But if a thin discharge comes out of the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, since there are some people who are slow in the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those of them who do the opposite of that.
But if unhealthy pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus is not adhering.
If, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then increase the drying medications, but let the physicians make them so that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their potency: such as diaphinicon ointment, when an excess of burnt alum is added to it.
And one of the most extreme methods with which it is treated is that you take diaphinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and sprinkle upon it old wine, equal in quantity.
Then mix it with it, and use it.
And honey does something similar to this action, when you do not have diaphinicon ointment at hand, when you cook it until it thickens, and use it. Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind it all up, and sprinkle it onto honey while it is on the fire. Then spread a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus: and spread with honey that you have cooked until it has thickened: and sprinkle spices on it, and put a cloth over it, and bind it.
And sometimes long birthwort is administered in it, and roots of celestial lily, that is, lily: and herb flour, and centaury. Use them singly, or combined, grind them, and sift them: and sprinkle them onto the honey that I mentioned, and use it.
But if the condition of the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment: then know, that there is corruption in its depth: or it now makes an impression on the bones, or on other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according as has been stated before.
¶ On the treatment of a whitlow and an injured nail, and the incision of an attached finger, and cutting.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it arises in the other fingers.
When therefore its condition is prolonged, and its treatment is neglected, and it becomes abscessed with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the end of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
When therefore you treat it, with what we said in the section, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you cut away with an instrument all the excess that remains of the nail. Then cauterize the wound afterward. For cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail now compress the flesh inward, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin probe under the corner of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upward: and cut that flesh easily, and put upon what remains of the flesh some of the burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If, however, the corruption now penetrates into the bone, then it is necessary that you cut that bone, and extract it: for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
But if you see the corrosion and corruption proceeding into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to what has been stated before. Then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, there occurs a bruise or a blow to the nail, and severe pain results, then it is necessary that you first phlebotomize the patient. Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, making a transverse cut from above downward.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the patient, and it will cause the growth of extra flesh in the place.
Then treat the area with that which soothes pain.
Now an extra finger which grows on the hands of some men, perhaps is entirely fleshy: and perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it: and some of them grow at the base of a joint, or its growth is on some of the knuckles of the finger. Thus, the one that grows on some knuckle of the finger does not move: and the one that grows near the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Therefore, the cutting of one of them that is fleshy is easy. That is, so that you cut it at its root with a broad scalpel.
However, the treatment of one whose growth is at the base of a joint is difficult. Therefore, abstain from cutting it.
But in the one that grows on a finger at the last knuckle, then it is necessary first to cut its flesh in a circular incision, right down to the bone. Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it. Then treat it until it heals.
The fusion, moreover, that happens to the fingers mutually, often happens either from the birth of a person, that is, he is born with it, or from the closing of a wound, or a burning by fire, and similar things.
It is necessary, therefore, to cut that fusion, until the fingers return according to their natural form. Then place between them lint, or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not fuse quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin sheet of lead, until the place is healed as it should be.
And similarly if fusion happens with some fingers and the palm, then cut that fusion, according as it is prepared and suitable to the shape of the limb.
On the Incision of a Birthmark.
Birthmarks are convoluted, thick veins, full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many limbs of the body: and their occurrence is mostly in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and laborers, and carriers.
It is therefore necessary that you administer a purging of the body from black bile sometimes with a strong purge.
Then bleed the patient's basilic vein.
The treatment of them with iron, however, is according to two methods. One of them is that they be cut, and the black blood be drawn out. And the other method is that the vein be lifted up, and extracted whole.
The cutting of it, however, is according to this method. First, bathe the leg copiously with hot water, until the thick, foul blood is dissolved. Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of his thigh down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage. Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three with a wide incision.
Then raise, that is, draw the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from the upper part, it is necessary for the bloodletter to have the patient at first. Then cut the nail with [something] down below: until a quantity of blood comes out which you see is sufficient and which the strength of the patient can tolerate.
Afterwards bandage it: and order him to abstain from foods producing black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting, when the veins are full, and that harms the patient.
The raising of it, however, is in this manner. Shave the patient's leg, if there are many hairs on it. Then place him in a bath: or bathe him on his leg with hot water, until it reddens, and the veins swell: or he should perform vigorous exercise, if a bath is not available to him, until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the skin lengthwise directly over the vein: either at its end near the knee or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and free the vein on all sides, until it appears to the senses: and at its appearance, you will see it tending from red towards black. When, therefore, it comes out of the skin, you will see it white as if it were a cord.
Then insert a probe under it until, when it is lifted and comes out of the skin, you suspend it with a blunt, smooth hook.
Then make another incision near that incision, three fingers away. Then free the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears. Then lift it with the probes as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need to. Then lift and cut it with a final incision near the heel.
Then draw it out to the incision which is above it.
And do this until you draw it out of the incision which is above, or higher than all the incisions, until it comes out completely: then cut it.
But if it does not yield to you for drawing and lifting: then insert a needle with strong double thread, and tie it, and draw it out: or insert a probe under it: and turn your hand in every direction, until it comes out. And take care that it not be cut. For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and harm befalls the patient from it.
When, therefore, you have drawn it out completely: then place upon the site of the wound wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and treat it until it is healed.
But if the branch is contracted, having a tortuosity to which there is a convolution in parts, and it is not as we have said along a straight path: then it is necessary that you cut upon it in every part of its tortuosity and places of its convolution.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you lift the whole of it: and beware when you cut on it lest you cut a vein or inflict a wound: for it will be difficult for you to lift or extract it. Therefore, maintain your prudence.
The Method of Cutting by which a Branch is Healed.
The Form of a Blind Hook.
It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor is it sharp at the end, so that it does not wound a vein: and it has a thick curvature, smooth: because if it were slender, it would cut the vein with its slenderness: rather, let it have excess thickness, as we have said.
On the extraction of a leg vein.
This vein arises in the legs in hot countries, like Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands, with little tenderness, that is, in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And perhaps it arises in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is indeed from putrefaction which occurs under the skin, just as snakes and roundworms occur within bodies, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the onset of the occurrence of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg. Then the area blisters. Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight should be from one qeel drachma up to two drachmas, and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Therefore, as often as something emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in lead, and tie it. But if it is greatly prolonged, then cut off a part of it and wrap the remainder. And do not cut it out by the root before the whole emerges. Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess to occur, and decay in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be handled gently, and drawn out little by little, until it emerges completely, and none of it remains in the body; and indeed from this vein, there emerges in some men what is five palms and ten in its length. And it has already come to my attention that one came out of a man twenty palms long.
But if it is cut during your treatment, then insert a probe into its opening, and perforate it with a long hole, along with the flesh, until everything that is in it of matter is evacuated: and treat the decay of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
And indeed this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the ankle joint, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out of every opening.
Therefore treat it, as we have said in the section, and with what has been stated before.
¶ On the incision over worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine disease.
This disease is called in a certain region among us bovine disease: because it often happens to cattle, and it is a single small worm, which is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending: and it is perceptible by its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through a place in the skin, and comes out.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors. Just as worms and snakes occur, that is, earthworms and roundworms, in the belly.
And it is feared because of its harmfulness. Because when it travels in the body, and rises to the head, and arrives at the eye: then perhaps it opens into it, and comes out, and destroys the eye: and that happens many times.
When, therefore, you wish to treat it, and extract it, then that is not done except at its movement and its appearance to the senses.
It is necessary, therefore, that you tie what is above it, and what is below it, with a ligature, tightly. Then cut above it, and extract it.
But if it goes deep into the flesh, and you do not find it: then put a cautery with fire upon the place, until it dies.
And the greatest thing that is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
But if you see that it has now arrived in the head near the eye, then tie below it the eyebrow with a good tightening. Then cut above it, and extract it.
And it is necessary that the sick person employ a cleansing of his body, with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods producing putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the illness Nakir.
This illness is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain which occurs in certain limbs: then it is transferred from limb to limb.
And I indeed have now seen it, according to what I describe to you. I was called to a sick woman in a certain village. And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the rope-like muscle of the arm.
And after I stayed an hour, I saw a swelling proceed with a spark, as a worm proceeds, climbing to her shoulder more quickly than is possible: so that it was like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Therefore the pain receded from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it arrived in the other arm.
Then she told me that it was revolving in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Therefore, I marveled at the speed of its movement from limb to limb. And I indeed had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner before. However, I saw many who experience pain moving from limb to limb, and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is anything other than because the woman was one of those with a dry constitution, with visible veins: hence, therefore, that shifting flatulence appears to the senses.
And it necessarily does not appear in this way in those who have a delicate constitution, and moist bodies, with hidden veins.
When, therefore, you wish to treat it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears visible to your eye, as we have said, then constrict above it, and quickly below it: and cut above it, until the constricted flatulence is released: and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by shaking the body, and with that which expels flatulence, and soothes it with foul-smelling pills, and pills of serapin, and similar things.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are varied according to their types, and according to the places in the body into which they fall.
Their diversity is indeed this: that some of them have large points, and small: and concave, and blunt. And some of them have three angles. And some of them have barbs. And some of them have thin shafts.
Those, however, which are according to the limbs in which they fall, are of two kinds. For either the parts are among the principal hollow organs, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones. When, therefore, it falls into one of these organs, and the signs of death, which I will describe to you later, appear to you, then you must avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows the one in whom it is, in most cases. And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For among the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and passes out through the membrane which is over the brain, are: that there occur from it intense headache, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile. And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils or ears. And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed. And a white moisture like porridge comes out from the place of the wound. And something resembling the wateriness of flesh comes out of it.
If, therefore, these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs, however, of an arrow when it falls into the heart are these: that it is near the left nipple, and it feels as if it is fixed in something hard, not in an empty space. And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound. And coldness of the extremities, a cold sweat, and fainting follow it. Know, therefore, that death undoubtedly follows.
And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the discharge of foamy blood from the wound, and the vessels that follow the neck swell up, and the color of the patient changes. And he exhales a great, deep breath, and seeks to draw in cold air.
But if the arrow falls into the membrane that is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there arises a great shortness of breath with intense pain, with sighing; and all the parts of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the belly and is fixed in it, some fecal matter, or a watery fluid, or intestine which is already ruptured comes out of the wound. Therefore there is no hope in its treatment, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
But if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out, and some of it goes outside, and the pain on the patient is stronger, then know that it is mortal.
The remaining limbs, however, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and upper arm, and vertebrae of the back, and clavicle, and hip, and leg, and those similar among the limbs are healed according to many arrangements: when the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may be informed about their treatment.
Which is, that to a certain man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose. I therefore extracted it for him from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow for a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I reached nothing of it except its small end, with which it adheres to its wood: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with smooth iron, which does not have barbs.
The Jew was therefore healed, and no ill effect befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arab arrow, and that is the one that has barbs. I therefore cut down upon it between the two collarbones: and it was already submerged in his throat. I therefore proceeded carefully with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After, therefore, thirty days had passed for him, and nothing in his condition had changed, I cut down upon the arrow: and I devised a plan concerning it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no ill befell him.
And I saw a man in whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound closed over it. After, therefore, seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the base of his hip.
And I saw a woman in whose belly an arrow had fallen, and the wound closed over it, and the arrow remained within her: and none of her conditions changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, in whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound closed and remained, not causing him much pain: and many things similar to these.
And I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the King's nobles, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already shifted a little to the right side: and the arrow was completely hidden.
I was therefore called to treat him three days after the arrow's impact. I therefore found the arrow wound very constricted.
I therefore probed it with a thin probe, and I did not feel it: and indeed, he himself felt a pricking and pain under his right ear. I therefore hoped that that pricking was from the end of the arrow.
I therefore applied a plaster to the area, one with drawing and digestive properties, trusting that the area would form an abscess and the sign of the arrow would appear to me so that I could cut over it: and no event happened in the area indicating that the arrow had reached the location.
Therefore, I persisted with the plaster on him for many days, and nothing happened, and the wound healed in the meantime; and he remained ill from its extraction for a period of days, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. And he told me this.
And he told me this. I therefore placed a sharp, corrosive medicine on that wound for many days until it opened: and when I probed it, I felt the thin end of the arrow which was stuck to the wood.
Then I continued applying that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound until the end of the arrow became visible to us: and a period of about four months elapsed for me with him.
Then, after the wound widened, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to extraction: then I did not cease to refine and devise upon it with ingenious methods, until one day I began working on it with properly made forceps, according to the form of which will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it. Then I treated the wound.
And physicians indeed judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored. Therefore, I restored it, and the wound healed, and the patient was healed with complete health; nor did it harm him at all.
And I tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may take that as a rule and guide concerning what I have not said.
For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood by narration: nor does a book encompass it, and the prudent practitioner compares the little to the much, and that which is present to that which is absent, and finds a new operation and a new instrument at the occurrence of unusual things in this art when they happen.
I say, therefore, that arrows do not come out of the limbs in which they are fixed, except in two ways. Either by pulling from the place from which it entered. Or from the opposite side.
And that which comes out whence it entered, either it is an arrow lodged in a fleshy place: and it is drawn out, and comes forth.
But if it does not readily come out at the time when it strikes: then it is necessary that you leave it for a few days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its extraction is eased, and its coming forth.
And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and it does not yield to you for removal, then also leave it for a few days: and work at it with pulling and movement every day, until it comes out.
But if it does not yield to you for removal after some days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself on every side with a fine drill, until the [entry wound of the] arrow is widened. Then draw it, and extract it.
However, if the arrow is now hidden within the body, and is concealed and hidden from the senses: then probe for it with a probe. But if you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
But if you cannot [get hold of] it, because of the narrowness of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the depths: and there is no bone there, nor nerve, nor vein: then cut over it, until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
But if it has barbs by which it is held, then free the flesh stuck in them on all sides, by every means that you can, and [use] ingenuity if it cannot escape the flesh on the breaking of the barbs and twisting of them, until it comes out.
And when you manage the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use a twisting motion of your hand, with forceps, in all directions, until you make it come out: and [do it] extremely delicately, so that the arrow is not broken, and its pulling, and its extraction, made difficult for you.
But if you cannot manage it immediately, then leave it for a few days, until the parts around it putrefy. Then try it again: for the flesh will be softened.  But if the flow of blood gives you trouble, then apply what we have described about treatment in its chapter: and guard your action against cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And use ingenuity in every way that is possible for you for the escape of the arrow: and let it be with ease, and calmness, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that, when you pull the arrow, the patient should be positioned according to the posture he was in when he was struck by the arrow. Because it is more helpful. But if that is not possible for you, then use whatever positions are possible for you.
Now, an arrow which comes out from the opposite side to the entry wound, either already projects somewhat outwards, or the end of the arrow makes a bump which can be felt above the adjacent skin, and you see it prominent: therefore cut over it, and let the incision be of a size sufficient for forceps to grasp it.
Then draw it out, for it will come out easily.
But if it is held fast in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion until the arrow turns in the bone, and enlarges the hole for itself: then draw it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days: then try again, until it comes out.
But if the shaft of the arrow is still on it, then push it through with that.
But if the shaft has fallen off, and you want to push it through, then insert a hollow instrument into it, so that its hollow part goes into the notch of the arrow: then push it through with that.
But if the arrow is hollow, then push it through with an instrument entering into it. For the arrow is made easier to remove by that.
But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is, if this is possible for you. Then treat it with what is suitable for that.
But if the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is near to what you touch with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut down on it, then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or a nerve, and draw it out.
Then sew the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be like a bird's beak, which are made like iron: when they grip the arrow, they do not let it go.
And many kinds are made of them, large, and small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow's largeness and smallness, and the width of the wound, and its narrowness.
The form of the concave pusher.
And the form of the blunt pusher.
This is of a blunt end like a spoke, so that its entry into the concave arrow is made easier, and it is pushed with it.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins to be phlebotomized, whose use has become customary in the body, are thirty.
Of which in the head are sixteen: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs: and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples: and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Lookers: and the prepared vein in the middle of the forehead: and the vein which is at the tip of the nose. And two Guidegi, which are in the neck. And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins which are in the lower lip. And these are the veins which are called Algecherich. And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins moreover which are opened in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is Cephalic, and is on the outer side: and the common people call it the head vein. And the dark one. And it is the middle vein, and is composed of a branch of the Basilic, and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the body vein. And the Basilic, and is placed on the inner side: and is also called Titillicaris. And the common people call it the belly vein. And the cord of the arm, and is located above the radius: and it is in this that one phlebotomizes, and it is that which appears above the thumb by manifest pulsation.
And the Salvatella: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins. One of them is that which is beneath the curve of the big toe on the outside. And the second is the Saphenous vein: and its location is near the heel on the inside. And the sciatic vein: and its place is at the heel on the outside.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomy of the two veins that are behind the ears is helpful for chronic catarrhs, and migraine, and scabies, and serious chronic ulcers of the head.
And the way to phlebotomize it is as I describe. And it is thus: the head of the patient is shaved, and the back of his head, where the two veins are, is rubbed well with a rough cloth. Then the patient should bind his neck with a band until the two veins appear. And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head. Therefore, search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark there with ink.
Then take a surgical lancet, which is the one called “Incision.” Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin using an incision stroke. And let the length of the incision be the width of two joined fingers, or about that: and let out as much blood as you wish.
Then compress it with small cushions, and leave it until it heals.
And the incision of these, and their cauterization, has already been discussed at the beginning of the book.
Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples, is for chronic migraine, and severe headache, and persistent eye disease, and the flow of sharp, overflowing humors to the eyes.
And the way to phlebotomize them is according to what I tell you. Let the patient tighten his neck a lot, until two veins appear, clearly visible to the senses: and their pulse becomes apparent beneath your finger. Then mark them with ink.
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet, cutting from below, and lift the vein upwards. And cut it, just as you did with the two other veins: and let the blood flow according to the amount you need.
Then release the binding of the patient, and place your finger over the vein for one hour. Afterwards, place cotton and small cushions over it, and bind it tightly from above: and leave it until it heals.
And the description of them, and their incision, and their extraction has already been given at the beginning of the book.
Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for long-standing illnesses of the face: and for migraine, and redness, and foul ulcers.
And the method of its phlebotomy is as I describe to you. Let the patient bind his neck with a bandage until the vein appears. Then take the instrument which is called a lancet.
Place the protruding point which is on the head of the lancet upon the vein itself, and strike upon it with the thumb, or with another thing in its manner: and let the blood run according to the quantity you wish. Then unbind the patient's incision and bandage it until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a broad fleam. However, it is not necessary that the fleam have a sharp point, as other fleams do, but rather let it have a broad point. And phlebotomize it transversely: because the bone is nearby: and perhaps the fleam will break in it when it is slender.
The benefit, however, of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, is for the eye from scabies and redness, and a speck in the eye, and ailments of the face.
And the way to phlebotomize them is that the patient bind his neck with a band. Then phlebotomize them: and you should be standing over his head.
And the phlebotomy should be done somewhat across the length, with a small lancet, a little wide, for there is no flesh in the place. For if the lancet is of a fine point, perhaps it will break.
Then let flow as much blood as is necessary for you. And place cotton over them, and bandage them for one night, and then loosen them.
Phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fever, and severe headache, and illnesses of the face, such as migraine, and redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is long-standing.
And the way to perform its phlebotomy is that the patient should bind his neck. Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long lancet; and insert it in the middle of the cleft, between what divides the nose lengthwise. Because the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you move your hand with the lancet a little, and let the blood flow according to your need. Then bandage it for one night. For it is restored quickly.
Indeed, the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two Guidegi veins is for shortness of breath, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and malignant ulcers, and corroding, that is, spreading herpes.
And the method of their phlebotomy is that the patient should tie a ligature under both in his neck: and the practitioner should stand above the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a chair.
Then bleed the vein somewhat widely lengthwise. Then draw out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for it. Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards loosen the ligature and bandage the two veins with a moderate tightness: so that the patient is not choked. And leave it until morning. For the wound heals.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins in the groin. Phlebotomy of the groin veins is beneficial because it helps with aphthous ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and malignant ulcers, and chapped lips, and malignant ulcers, also those that are in the nose and around it.
And the way to perform their phlebotomy is that you have the patient sit before you and tie a band around his neck. Then turn back his lip, and look at the two veins: one of which is on the right of the lip, and the second on its left: and the indication of each is by the blackness of both. And that is true: because around them are small, black veins. Therefore, incise each with a lancet.
But if you are in doubt, and do not know which of them it is, then aim to incise the larger and more evident of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed the custom is generally observed with it: and incise the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ On phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein. Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for choking which is in the throat, and disease of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.
And the way to phlebotomize them is as follows: that the sick person sits between your hands facing the sun: and you lift his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on its other side for a vein: and the color of each tends toward blackness.
Phlebotomize therefore each one: and take care not to reach your hand too far when phlebotomizing them. For beneath them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries might occur.
The three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow, moreover, are those in whose phlebotomy a custom has prevailed among all people.
And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods. Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle-leaf lancet: or an olive-shaped one, sloping to a point: or by incising with a knife-shaped lancet, and this is the Alnesil. And this is its form.
And among them are broad types, and narrow ones, according to the size of the veins and their tightness. The form of the myrtle lancet should be broad, as you see. And it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, visible, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this lancet is of lesser width and more delicate at the point.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of slender veins, which contain thin, clear blood.
Phlebotomy of the Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is beneficial. For it draws blood from ailments which are below the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the belly: and it is fitting for the bloodletter when he performs phlebotomy on it, that he be cautious, and proceed with care, for beneath it is an artery. Therefore, if he errs and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a hemorrhage will occur. Therefore, he ought not to phlebotomize it with a lancet: rather, let him incise it with a scalpel.
But if the Basilic vein does not appear manifestly, then it is necessary that you leave it and turn to another, or seek some branch of it; or phlebotomize the median cubital vein in its place. For that one is visible, and incise it with a scalpel, as we have said.
But if you wish to phlebotomize that same vein, then before the tightening of the arm, it is necessary that you touch the area until you recognize the location of the pulse. Then mark the spot with ink, afterwards [constrict] the arm, and incise the vein with a concave incision using a scalpel, as we have said. And be careful that the incision does not fall near the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the bandage, a swelling in the place that you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
But if you see blood spurt during the phlebotomy, like a boy's urine, and the blood is thin and red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery. Then hurry, and place your finger over it for a long time, then remove your finger. If therefore the blood is stopped (for it is often stopped) then bind the arm and leave it: and let the patient beware of moving it, and let him be without fear.
And let him not move it for a few days, until it is healed.
But if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at hand at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you. For its ends contract, and the blood flow is stopped.
Or take the bark of a pistachio tree, and split it: take one half, and tie it firmly over the place of the vein with a bandage and pads until the next day.
Then, if the bleeding stops, it is good. And if not, then treat it with that which was mentioned before from the section on powders that stop the flow of blood: and stopping its bleeding is not difficult in most cases, because of the small size of the wound, and the possibility of bandaging from the arm.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the Basilic vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower part of the body: because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein, and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is fitting for the bloodletter to be cautious about phlebotomizing it, for beneath it is a nerve. If therefore he goes deeper in the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds the nerve, numbness occurs in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
And this nerve often appears to the senses. But if it is hidden in some men, and is slender, and is not visible: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize it, the incision with the lancet, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
But if the vein is between two nerves, then open the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the Cephalic Vein. Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, moreover, is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and is advantageous for diseases of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with a lancet shaped like an olive, or with a lancet shaped like a myrtle leaf: because it is the safest of all veins, since there is no artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, it is proper for you during phlebotomy, that you avoid with the lancet the head of the muscle itself, and seek a smoother place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first incision, that it be repeated upon it with the lancet a few times.
However, perhaps an abscess forms in certain men when it is not phlebotomized on the first incision, but that abscess does not harm them at all.
Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it. Now the character of phlebotomy, and its consequences from it, in whose correction you must consider.
The first of it, therefore, is that which it is necessary for you to know, that phlebotomy is not administered, except for the preservation of health, and its continuation, and caution against the arrival of illnesses.
And that phlebotomy should be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and Median, and Basilic. And that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in spring, and summer: and in autumn, and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours of the day have passed.
Phlebotomy, however, which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour: but when suitability and necessity call for it, at night, or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And children should not be phlebotomized until they reach fourteen years of age. Nor should a pregnant woman be phlebotomized, except from the fourth month to the seventh. Nor should old men, who have already passed sixty years, be phlebotomized.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be phlebotomized for whatever reason: it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines before phlebotomy with a mild enema, if there is much retained feces in them: so that the veins do not draw from the intestines during phlebotomy putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members.
Nor should a patient suffering from nausea, that is, sickening fullness, be phlebotomized: nor one who has overeaten, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that condition is removed from them. Nor a patient with dropsy.
And phlebotomy should be avoided again after an attack of colic, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and sleeplessness, and fasting, and anything that weakens the strength from a bodily or animal cause.
Then consider the thinness of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prevents him: or let him be exercised with some exercise, so that the blood may be thinned.
And perform his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said: and try to ensure that his chest is emptied that day of all bad animal occurrences: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and of all bodily occurrences, such as exertion, and pain, and excessive intercourse, and things like these.
And let things be present in his place with the use of which the custom of men has run concerning aromatics, and fragrance, and rejoicing and things like these to the extent possible.
Then let the bloodletter sit on a cushion, which is higher than the cushion of the one to be bled: afterwards let him extend his arm, and let the bloodletter rub it with his hand twice, or three times. Then let him tighten the bandage with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the tightening be moderate, because when the tightening is uneven, either through excessive tightening, then it prevents the flow of blood: or in looseness, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Then after the tightening it is necessary that the person to be bled rub his hands together until the veins swell and are revealed to the senses.
Then let the bloodletter wipe the lancet with a little old oil, specifically.
Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself a little below the place where he intends to make the incision, so that the vein does not escape and the striking goes astray. For among veins there is one which you find like a fleeing chord at bloodletting: and among them is one which is full of wind: and when you place the lancet upon it, it contracts under the lancet, and the bloodletter is deceived, and the lancet does not open the vein: and if it does open it, it is constricted: on account of this, therefore, it is necessary that the bloodletter be steadfast and attentive in all these matters.
Then he puts down the lancet. Therefore, if the vein is opened on one side, then it is good. And if not, then repeat it on the other side a little below that place, or above it, quickly, unless the place swells up.
But if it swells, or the patient is afraid, then leave him for a day, or two days, and he should not tighten the bandage. For perhaps it will draw out a hot swelling. And he should not enter the bath.
Then he may repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly, and you fear that the amount of blood you want will not come out, then repeat the incision in the same hole along a straight line, and go a little deeper in the operation.
And do this quickly, before the place swells, for the place swells in many people with a small operation.
Therefore if you see it already swollen, then do not repeat the operation on it at all, for it will not excuse anything for you. And put some oil dregs on it: because it eases the flow of blood. And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly use oil dregs in all your phlebotomy, with which you open veins when the flow of blood is obstructed: and theriac al-faruq and sagapenum do this, when one of them is placed on the area.
For the blood is thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
But if a large swelling occurs at the place of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to him who has not been bled except on that occasion, or the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little: and bind it for one hour: because it dissolves.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has come out from the vein itself, when it is completed, or from another vein.
But if some blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm: and if you wish, put on it some dissolved aloe or myrrh: or some juice of horsemint, that is, calamint, or something similar.
And swellings and protuberances often occur near the phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
Therefore, place your hand on it, then if you find softness when you press upon it, then that swelling is bad. Beware, therefore, of putting on it anything of what we have mentioned. For perhaps arterial blood will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with something that has astringent properties, so that the area hardens. Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you draw blood from every man according to the strength of his constitution. And what appears from the prevailing color over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it reddens: and similarly if you see it thick, then let it flow until it thins: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, it is necessary that the opening of the vein be enlarged, and that the lancet be wide; and in one who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that you draw it in turns, and that the opening be narrow: and the best way to manage the opening of the vein is a transverse cut, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from the flow of blood and from the cutting of a nerve, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting along the width and length.
And for someone who usually experiences fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary that he eats a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice before bloodletting, or oxymel, if he has a fever: and you should draw blood from him in three or four turns.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before bloodletting bread soaked in apple syrup, or in syrup of honey flavored with spices, or in fragrant, aromatized syrup.
But if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and the cause of it is the loss of much blood, then it is necessary that he drink meat broth and a light, fragrant syrup: and that he use aromatics with civet, and that his chest be anointed with it: and that he use the other things that we mentioned in the section in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Now whoever wishes to open his arm and let his blood a second time—it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is on account of much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he let blood little by little according to the amount of his strength on successive days.
But whoever wishes to open his arm and let his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
Now whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it tends, it is necessary that he be opened on the second or third day.
But in whose body there is much blood already heated, and it is sharpened, and it causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood come out of him in one turn, and that a large quantity be drawn from him: and that the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs, after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting: and that you place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting. For this happens often, when the bloodletter is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
And it is not appropriate, when you wish to open the arm and let blood a second time, since the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that it be pressed upon vehemently, and that what is bent be extended quickly. For that is very bad; rather leave it alone until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of the lancet that which has coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it some salt dissolved in water. And place on it some of the antidote *al-fārūq*, or *saǧzīnaj*, and apply a light compression until the blood comes out.
But if the vein has already become swollen, then leave it alone, and do not cover it, until the swelling subsides.
But if necessity compels the letting of blood a second time, and there is no other option, then either bleed it above that place, or on the other arm in another vein.
The median cubital vein may be bled in the place of the cephalic and basilic veins, when they are not found and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
And the way to bleed it is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be tied above it with a ligature, moderately tight. Then bleed it transversely, little by little, not across the width nor along the length: and the opening should be wide, and your bleeding should be a little way above the wrist joint.
But if the flow of blood is stopped, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have drawn off the required amount.
However, if it is during the summer days, then you are excused from putting the hand back into warm water. And running the blood into warm water is most often done in winter time.
And bleeding this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither a pulsating vein nor a nerve beneath it.
Bleeding the Salvatella vein of the right hand, however, is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
And the way to bleed it is this: that you tighten the wrist of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you place it in warm water, until the vein swells and becomes very apparent to the senses. Then bleed it transversely. And if you cut it completely through, it will not harm it in any way.
And take care not to extend your hand with the lancet. For beneath it are the tendons of the fingers, bare of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water and let the blood flow in it. For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and be prevented from flowing.
When, therefore, you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then put oil and salt upon the vein, so that it may not close quickly.
And similarly you should do with every constricted vein.
The benefit, however, of its bloodletting from the left hand is that it is helpful for illnesses of the spleen: and similarly do in its bloodletting, just as you did in the second, equally.
The benefit, however, of saphenous bloodletting, is for illnesses which are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of the menses, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and chronic ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the method of its bloodletting is that the patient should put his foot into warm water and rub it until the veins swell; and tie above the ankle joint with a strap. And indeed the location of the veins is near the heel, appearing towards the big toe: and many branches branch out from it on the surface of the foot.
Bleed it, therefore, in its wider branch, or near the heel in its confluence, because it is better and safer.
But if you bleed it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are under it on the surface of the foot.
And place your lancet, with which you bleed it, crosswise, as if you want to incise it: and let the lancet be pointed.
But if the flow of blood is impeded, then soak his foot in warm water and let the blood run into it until it is drained.
But if the bloodletter misses the vein the first time, then he should repeat with the lancet a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel on the outside.
And its benefit from bloodletting is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the method of its bloodletting is that the patient enter the bath and hurry: and bind his leg from the side of the hip to above the heel by four fingers, with a thin long band: for it does not appear except because of that.
When therefore it appears, then bleed it according to whatever skill is possible for you, either by transverse incision, and it is better, or that you incise it with an incision, or cut it with a section. For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most people.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most people. But if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then bleed some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and toward the little toe: and beware of the nerves, and let flow from the blood the quantity you wish.
Then loosen the binding, and place leather over the place of the bloodletting, and bind the place. For it heals quickly.
On Cupping, and the Method of its Use.
Cupping glasses are made from horns, and from bronze, and from glass.
And cupping is done in two ways. With scarification, and extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification, is done in two ways. Either it is with fire. Or it is without fire.
And cuppings which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are [in] fourteen locations of the body. Of which one is, the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are the two sides of the neck on both sides together: and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the face: and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and the cuppings of Alachosos upon the end of the tailbone: and the cuppings of the two armpits, and they are the middle of the two arms: and the cuppings of the two legs: and the cuppings of the two ankles.
And cupping indeed does not draw blood for you from the small veins dispersed in the flesh, and because of that, strength does not diminish from them, as is the case from phlebotomy. Nor is it appropriate to administer cupping either with fire, or without fire in any of the illnesses which arise from plethora, until the entire body is evacuated.
But if necessity compels cupping because of illness, or because of habit, we administer it at any time at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in its middle, and whenever it may be.
Which is because there are some people who, when blood increases in them until they need to have it drawn by cupping, experience heaviness in their head, and sodahan.
And there are some who experience fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. And there are some who experience itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And there are some who scratch the place where they are cupped. And there are some whose laughter increases. And there are some who find the taste of blood in their mouth, or their tongue swells up and they spit blood. And there are some whose sleep increases. And there are some who see in their sleep blood and redness, and slain people, and wounds, and things similar to these.
When therefore we see something of these signs, especially if it is in the third part of the month, then we prescribe phlebotomy, after two or three hours of the day have passed.
The benefit, moreover, of cupping the nape of the neck is this: that it helps with heaviness in the head and what flows to the eyes. But indeed it is necessary that this be after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping indeed is in place of cephalic phlebotomy.
And it is not permitted for one of cold complexion to use it, nor for one in whom there is a catarrh. For it brings great harm to him.
And on account of that it is not necessary that old men use it, and those in whose head there are cold illnesses.
Whoever becomes accustomed to it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
And on account of that, it is necessary that you instruct the cupper to lower his hand with the cupping glass for a little while to the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Cupping, or Alkehel, is in place of the median cubital vein phlebotomy, and the basilic vein phlebotomy, and on account of that it is beneficial for asthma, and shortness of breath, and a rupture of the windpipe, and cough, and fullness.
And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping glass be applied for a short time, because if it is placed for too long, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping, indeed alhagdahim, is beneficial for pains occurring in the head, and for eye inflammation, and migraine, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of basilic vein phlebotomy.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to press his hand with the scarification: so that he does not cut an artery, and a hemorrhage occurs.
Cupping, moreover, under the chin, benefits thrush in the mouth, and infection of the gums, and illnesses similar to them which are in the mouth: and it takes the place of the phlebotomy of alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Cupping, moreover, of the shoulder blades, is beneficial for alchafacham, which arises from repletion and heat.
Cupping, indeed, of the inner parts of the two thighs, provides the benefit of phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilic, and Median Cubital, and Cephalic: because it draws blood from all those small veins, which are in the flesh: and those small veins draw from other veins thicker than them, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to proceed too deeply in the scarification: because the place is devoid of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Cupping, moreover, which is performed on the coccyx, is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus, and lower ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that the cup be large, and that it be made of brass: because the place requires strong suction, and perhaps thin cups are broken: and let him scarify with a large scarification.
Cuppings, moreover, of the legs diminish manifestly: because they draw blood from the whole body, and are beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, and womb, and bladder: they provoke menses, and are beneficial for buboes and elephantiasis: and they take the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and the popliteal vein.
Nevertheless they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting to occur in many people.
And the benefit of cupping the popliteal vein is similar to the benefit of cupping the two legs.
The proper way of placing the cups is that you first place the empty cup, and suck with moderate suction: and you do not prolong the placement of the cups, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with an even flow: and you do not cease to repeat this and continue, until you see the place now redden and swell, and the redness of the blood appears: then therefore scarify, and repeat the suction gradually. Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
For whoever has tender flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, no more: so that the place does not ulcerate.
And instruct the cupper to broaden the scarification, and deepen it a little: and to moderate the suction with ease, and speed, and gentle movement.
But if the blood is thick, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice. Indeed, in the first time a way is opened for the thinning of the blood, and its wateriness: and in the second, indeed, for the careful examination of the extraction of thick blood.
But if the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be done a third time: so that the end is achieved.
And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little, one scarification is sufficient for us. But if we want the extraction of much blood, we scarify with many scarifications.
And if we judge that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification: and the proper limit in scarification is the depth of the skin.
What must be administered from oils at the placing of cupping glasses, and what the person being cupped should beware of.
In the one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places to be cupped be anointed with opening, softening, dissolving oils: if it is in the summertime, such as oil of sesame, or violet oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seed.
And if it is in the wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or iris oil: and those similar to them.
But if the superfluity is thick, cold: then let the oil be marjoram, or oil of balsam mint, or oil of mustard seed, or dill oil: and those similar to them.
If, however, the person to be cupped is of wide pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary that he be kept from oil, and it is necessary that they wash the places of their cupping glasses after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with nightshade water, or with cucumber water, or with purslane water: and those similar to them.
However, let the one whose blood has much moisture wash the cupping glasses with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and those similar to them.
But let the one whose superfluities are thick wash his cupping glasses with old wine, or with elderflower water, or a decoction of dill, or of chamomile: and those similar to them.
And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in the bath, or immediately after the bath, rather it is necessary that it be administered after leaving the bath by an hour, or by two hours.
And it is not necessary that anyone sleep after cupping.
What is necessary for one who is about to be cupped or phlebotomized before cupping?
And after it, it is necessary that you consider first of all: then if the one who has been cupped or phlebotomized is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood: then it is necessary that he take cooling things, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and julep, and jujube: and those similar to them.
And offer for his foods chickens and the meat of yearling sheep, and foods seasoned with verjuice, and things similar to them.
And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink a syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and let him be instructed to consume a small amount of food. And include in his food chickens, and partridges, and sparrows, that is, small birds: and young pigeons roasted.
And it is necessary that the drink on the day of cupping and phlebotomy be more than the food: and it is necessary that in the drink for some men, at times, be given theriac faruq, or a medicine of musk, that is, nutmeg, or alesselithe before cupping: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood thinned. And they should not take it in a heated drink.
¶ Concerning Cupping without Scarification. Cuppings which are without scarification are cuppings that are placed over the liver, and spleen, and gout, and over the belly, navel, and the region of the kidneys, and the hip joint: since these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
And they are not sought for these except for drawing blood from one member to another: just as we place a cupping glass on the breasts in the case of a nosebleed. And we use them to release from a member cold, viscous wind: as when we place a cupping glass over the belly and navel. For it rarefies the member and warms it, and removes pain because it dissipates that wind.
It is also placed over the kidneys, when blockage or a stone occurs in them. For by the power of its suction, perhaps it opens the blockage or pulls the stone from its place.
And it acts similarly when placed over the liver and spleen for the purpose of grinding up wind in both of them.
And these cupping glasses are administered empty with scarification only. And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in cases of pleurisy: and that is so that the cupping glass, a large one, is filled with plain hot water, or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The method of cupping administered with fire.
Let the width of its opening be two spread fingers, according to what we have described: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be on its side, at a point about halfway down, a small hole, the size of which a needle could enter: let it be made from thick, smooth, even, polished bronze or brass: so that it does not injure the limb when it is placed upon it: and let there be in the middle of it a transverse rod of bronze or iron, where a lit candle is placed.
And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than the one we have described, and a little smaller than that, depending on the illnesses and age of the one who uses it.
For the cupping glasses of children, and thin people are different than the cupping glasses of men, and those with large bodies.
The way to place this cupping glass with fire on a limb is as follows: light a wick of linen properly with fire, or a small wax candle: and place it on the middle of the transverse rod that is in the middle of the cupping glass: so that the lit fire is near the lower part of the cupping glass, so as not to burn the patient's body.
Then it should be placed upon the limb: and a finger should be over the hole which I mentioned, as long as we are holding the cupping glass: when we need to, we remove the finger, and the vapor will escape through that hole, and the cupping glass will immediately release.
Then ignite the wick according to its proper method, and repeat this if you need to.
The cupping glass, however, which is used in cases of pleurisy, with water, does not have a transverse rod, nor a hole: and it is only used by filling it with water, and placing it on the limb.
And this is its form.
And this cupping glass, the larger it is, so that it may hold much water, the better it is.
¶ On the application of leeches.
Leeches are not administered in many places, except in those limbs where the placement of cupping glasses is not possible, because of their smallness, such as the lip, and the gum, and similar things. Or in a limb denuded of flesh, like a finger, and a nose, and similar things.
And the way to use them is this: that you should obtain leeches which are in fresh waters, free from putrefaction.
Then they should be left for a day and a night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their belly. Then the body should first be evacuated with phlebotomy, and with cupping glasses. Then wipe the limb of the patient until it reddens. Afterwards, they should be placed upon it.
When therefore they are filled, and they fall, and suction of the place with a cupping glass is possible, then it is most effective in aid: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. Then with much water, and it should be rubbed, and squeezed.
But if the flow of blood continues after the fall of the bloodsuckers, and it does so by oozing: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the oozing is stopped.
But if the blood increases, then sprinkle on it ground alum, or gallnuts, and similar styptics: until the blood is stopped.
Or peeled halves of beans may be placed over the area: and left until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
And it is necessary if repetition of the bloodsuckers is required, when possible, to change them.
But if the leeches are prevented from attaching, then the area should be wiped with fresh blood. Or stick a needle in places until some of the blood comes out. Then they should be placed, for when they sense some blood, they adhere immediately.
When, therefore, you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some ground aloe, or salt, or ash: and they will fall off immediately.
This chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of medicine, and it concerns the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in the bones.
Know, O sons, that foolish physicians and common people, and those who have never looked into a book of the ancients, nor read a letter of it, boast about this chapter.
And for this reason it happens that this method from among the sciences is unknown in our land. And I never encountered anything good at all in it, and I did not obtain from it what I obtained except through long reading of ancient books, and study upon their understanding, until I extracted its knowledge from them.
Then I adhered to experience and study for the duration of my life.
And now I have described for you in this chapter all that my knowledge contains: and upon which my experience has passed, after I have abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the work of prolongation, and shortened it with the utmost brevity, and shown it without digression: and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments which are used in it, with the addition of digression, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter II.
It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter, the main points of the discussion, and the headings, to whose understanding the practitioner is first compelled for establishing their truth: namely so that you, and those who are ready, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or sprain, or fall happens to someone: then it is necessary that you hasten first to phlebotomize him, and loosen him, or both together: unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength: or the one to whom something of these has happened is a boy, or a decrepit old man: or it is a time of intense heat, or very intense cold.
Then let him be content in his food with cold vegetables, and the meat of birds and goats, and avoid wine and rich meats, and being filled with foods and any food that fills the veins with blood. Until, when you are safe from a hot abscess, and you do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the patient return to his first regimen with which his habit has run.
When, therefore, the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the patient be nourished with very nourishing, rich, heavy foods, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and things like these. For with this regimen the coagulation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in early old age, and decrepit, it is not possible that they be joined and consolidated according to their nature always, because of the dryness of their limbs: and those of them that are at the extreme of softness, like the bones of small children, are consolidated and joined.
Nevertheless, nature attaches over the broken bone from every side something like glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds it, until they are glued together, and tied together, until it comes to the point of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its functions: and for this reason it is necessary that you place as the patient's nourishment foods in which there are heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: since a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull: and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of a vertebra: and similarly all the other limbs differ from each other: and I will come with a description of every type of fracture explained in its own Chapter distinct from the other. And the types of bone fracture are also diverse in themselves.
Since its fracture may be curved, besides splinters occurring in it. And sometimes its fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and there are pointed fractures of it, that is, splinters, and protruding additions, just as they are in a reed when it is prepared with a knife for writing. And not protruding: and there is a fracture with a wound and a break in the head: and there is a fracture, a small fissure.
And each type has a specific character, or instrument for its restoration, according to what will be recalled about it, distinguished in its own place.
And from this the fracture of the bone is recognized, its crookedness and its prominence: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
When, therefore, there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor sound at your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the patient feel great pain: then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there may be crookedness, or a small fissure: therefore you should not move it at all with your hand and pressure, but instead put on it some of the medicines, which will be mentioned, after the appropriate time for the place: then it should be bound with a tight bandage.
And know that when a place is bent and split in two, besides the fact that inflammations occur in it, nevertheless every part is moved from its counterpart: then you must begin immediately to straighten it, making it even before a hot abscess develops.
But if a hot abscess develops, then leave it for a few days, until the abscess subsides. Then straighten it in any way you can with gentleness and skill.
And know that its restoration and straightening are easier than in a bone in which fractures occur.
Then bind it as you see fit.
But if there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this fractured limb from both sides, if it is a hand, or a foot: either with your hand, if the limb is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb on a level place, according to its natural shape, until the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then endeavor to restore those fractured parts with all skill, and in any way you can to their places: and beware according to your strength, lest pain or injury befall the weak person through your work: and endeavor according to your strength to join one of the two bones with its companion, in the best possible manner.
And at that time it is necessary that you test and touch it with your hand. If, therefore, you see anything amiss there, correct it, and adjust it according to your ability.
And beware of forceful extension, and strong compression, as many fools do. For they often cause by their procedure a hot abscess, or contraction in the limb, as we have seen often from their work.
Then, after the setting and proper procedure and bandaging of that limb, connect rest and quiet, and advise the patient about it. And make him take care not to move it during his waking hours and his sleep, in turning and moving, and when relieving himself, and in all his movements with the utmost strength. And let him beware lest the position of the limb be a position which causes pain. That is because, when he feels pain or injury from the position of the limb, then it is necessary to change it to another position that does not cause pain.
And be careful with him, so that his position is even and straight, so that crookedness may not occur in the limb when it is restored.
And the manner of binding a fractured limb is as I describe.
Know that fractured limbs differ in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Therefore, those of them which are small, such as the arm, and finger, and radius, and similar to them, then it is necessary that the wrapping of soft, thin cloth be used. Those of them which are thick, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that a wide, hard wrapping be used on them.
Because a wide bandage connects a large limb and binds it on all sides with an even tightness, so that no spot is missed.
Then begin, after your evacuation, with the setting, to place a suitable ointment on soft tow over the place of the fracture itself. Then begin to wrap the bandage over the place of the fracture itself with three or four turns, according to what the limb requires, and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Then go with it to the part above the place of the fracture, and tighten less than your tightening with which you tightened the fractured place. Then move away with the wrapping from the place of the fracture a little, and gradually soften the tightening until you take in a large part of the healthy area.
Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the fractured place with turns. Afterwards, go with the bandaging to the part below the fracture. And let your work in the tightening of the bandaging, and its loosening, be according to what we said about the first upper bandaging.
Then place between the bandages some soft tow, or cloth, with which the crookedness of the fracture is leveled, if there is crookedness in it: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Then wrap another bandage over it. Then neatly arrange suitably made splints over these bandages immediately, if there is no swelling in the area, nor a hot abscess.
But if there is swelling in it, or an abscess: then put on it something that settles that abscess and removes the swelling: and leave it for a few days. Then at that time tighten the splints over it.
And the splints should be from halves of a broad reed, smoothed, skillfully shaped: or they should be from the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or palm branches, or reeds: and let the width of every splint be according to this form, and this same shape.
However, it is necessary that the splint which is placed over the fracture itself be a little thicker and wider than the other splints: and the length of the splint should be according to what is allowed by the limb in size and smallness.
Then tighten over the splints with another bandage, in the same way as the first bandaging. Then tie over it neatly with threads, according to what we have said about the bandaging: and it is so that your bandaging is more over the place of the fracture: and the further it is extended from the fracture, the less the bandaging.
And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and thinness, and be of soft linen.
Because if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the work of fools placing their threads from twisted cords of linen, it is a great error: because the bandaging turns out improperly with them.
And thin threads again are not suitable: because you will not achieve through the bandaging with them what you want.
And it is not appropriate that there be less than a finger's breadth between splint and splint.
But if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after bandaging in healthy places, then place under them some soft tow, or carded wool, until he is not injured at all by it.
When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and a laceration happens in the skin, I will come to the discussion of it in the second chapter individually.
And know that not every fractured limb should be bound with splints from the first day. Because, when the limb is large, it is not appropriate to place splints on it except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your certainty about the outcome of a hot abscess.
And this is the method of plasters, which the ancients restored, which are placed on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ The method of a common abbreviated plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially for women and children: because it is of a kind not overcome by heat, nor cold.
And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, which is the marrow of the flour hanging on the walls of the mill from the motion of the millstone, and prepare it as it is, except that you sift it with egg white; and make the mixture neither thick nor thin. Then use it.
¶ The method of another plaster, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and sprain. Take almese, and laudanum, and acacia, and elecampane, and mugwort: and the juice, of each ten drams; myrrh, and aloes, of both five drams each; and wild carrot twenty drams; let all be ground, and sifted, and mixed with wild carrot water: or with egg white, if the patient's complexion is heated. Then use this plaster. For it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and is suitable for many people.
¶ The method of another plaster, which is also suitable for fracture and sprain. Take mugwort, and mastich, and white marshmallow, of each ten drams; myrrh, and aloes, of both five drams each; acacia six drams; Armenian bole twenty drams; let all be ground very finely, and sifted, and prepared with water, or egg white: and let them be administered.
¶ The method of a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places: and it soothes the pain affecting them, and the splitting of the bone, and the fracture. Take greasy wool, and soak it in vinegar and boiled oil: and place it over the area.
And in this plaster, indeed, there is no power of restoration, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess: and it properly expels pains.
¶ The method of a plaster which restores a fractured bone. Take leaves of the deaf fig and leaves of the wild poppy, and grind them all up, and make a plaster from both.
¶ The method of a shortened plaster, administered for the restoration of a bone fracture: and when you want resolution of the remaining abscess. Take root of marshmallow, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and grass meal, one part of each: let all be ground, and prepared with wine, if the limb is not heated.
But if it is heated, then prepare it with the water of fresh coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ The method of another plaster, stronger in resolution than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb. Take marshmallow root, and linseed, and pomegranate rind, and melilot, and elderflower, and violet flower, and chamomile, one part of each, let all be ground, and prepared with willow water, or with fresh water, or with wine. All of this according to the heat of the limb, and the subsiding of its heat.
Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration, except a cerate made of wax and oil: nothing else: and he explained that it should be medium between thickness and thinness.
It seemed to Galen, however, that things which dry out heat, such as myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and things similar to them from among those which we have mentioned, should be placed upon the fractured limb during its restoration.
The Method of a Plaster Which Benefits Injury and Pain. Take equal parts of gum acacia, chickpeas, cut human hair, or bird feathers, marshmallow, and salt: let them be ground, sifted, and mixed: and let a plaster be made from it.
The length of time it should remain bandaged, before being loosened, is such that you should then consider if the patient experiences no pain, nor itching, nor is the fractured bone moved from its place: then you should not unbind it for many days. But if there occurs in that place intense itching, or troubling pain, or swelling, then hurry and unbind it immediately, and remove the plaster from it, and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, wet it, and soak it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain is soothed.
But if there occurs in that place intense itching, or troubling pain, or swelling, then hurry and unbind it immediately, and remove the plaster from it, and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, wet it, and soak it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain is soothed. Then allow the limb to rest for one hour. Then place upon it clipped wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bandage it overnight, until you are sure of no hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Then return to a light bandaging and a small plaster, and do not bind it as tightly as your first bandaging, and continue with light bandages until it is healed.
But if you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all the symptoms are now completely gone, and you need a plaster and bandaging, then repeat it just as you did in the beginning, equally.
But if none of the things we have mentioned happen to the limb, then do not unwrap it for three, or four, or five, or seven days. And sometimes it is left for a full twenty days, according to what you see from the condition of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and the flesh grows over it: then tighten the bandaging more than your first bandaging: and also increase the richness of the patient's food, as was mentioned before.
If, however, you see the site of the fracture drying out and becoming thinner than it should be, then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it. Therefore bathe it with warm water every time you unwrap it, and do this for three days, and loosen the bandaging a little.
By this procedure, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
What foolish bone-setters do, setting a limb a second time when it was not properly set the first time, and setting it crookedly, is an error in their practice, and a great danger: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said so in their books and would have practiced it.
And I have nowhere seen any trace of them doing so at all, and it is better that it not be done.
Concerning a fracture occurring in the head.
The types of fracture are diverse, and its forms are many: and its causes are distinct.
For there is a fracture which is made by a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the entire bone until it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood: and for that reason this type of fracture is called Axial.
Or the sword cuts some of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the cut does not penetrate to its deepest part: and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a scraping away, absolutely.
And it is a wound of two fractures, either large, or small.
And there is a fracture which is a crushing or a grinding: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture is also either penetrating, which now approaches the membrane, which is under the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone with the fineness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Hairline.
And among them is a fracture, which is made by a fall, or a blow from a stone, and similar things, which cause the layer of bone to go inwards, and a concavity is made in the place: as happens to copper kettles, when a blow strikes them, and part of them goes inwards.
And indeed this happens most often in the heads with moist bones, such as are the heads of children.
And for all these types of fractures, separate techniques are employed, and I will come with a complete account of that in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by examining over it, and investigating them with probes, and removing the corrupted flesh which is over them.
But the hairline type is recognized by this, that it is uncovered over the bone, and it is cleaned, and ink is smeared over it: for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms that they clearly indicate grounds for fear, such as vomiting of bile, and stretching, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and fainting, and high fever, and bulging of the eyes, and redness of them, and things like these among the symptoms in many cases, without doubt he will not be healed: and if you see that the symptoms do not frighten you, and you hope for recovery, then begin his treatment.
Which is, if a wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded: and that is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you endeavor to remove the bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from the membrane is corrupted, and those symptoms that we have described occur.
But if the fracture of the bone now reaches the membrane touching the brain, and it is with small pieces, and pulling: then it is necessary that you cut out the comminuted and damaged part, according to what I tell you.
And it is, that you shave the head of the wounded man: and expose it over the bone in whatever way is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is easy for the patient.
But if there happens to you during the exposure of the bone a flow of blood, or a hot abscess: then treat it with what is necessary. And it is, that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and you allow the wound to rest, until the abscess settles, and you are safe from the flow of blood. Then begin the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
And that is done according to one of two methods.
One method indeed is that you cut the bone with a sharp-edged incisor: and this is its form.
Then manage another incisor after the incisors a little wider than it: and this is its form.
Then also manage another incisor even wider than the second.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisors: some of which are wider than others, and some of them shorter than others: and let them be at the utmost sharpness of their extremities, and let them be of Indian steel, or steel: and use gentleness in striking upon the incisor, so that it does not shake the head, and injure it.
But if the bone is strong, hard: then it is necessary that you perforate around its circumference, before you manage the incisors, with drills which are called non-penetrating drills: and they are not so named except because they do not pass the limit of the fleshy bone to that which is behind it: because the drill has a round extremity above that which is under its sharp head, like a margin, and a small circle prevents it from being submerged, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is fitting for you to take from these drills a large number, each of which corresponds to the size of the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill for every skull: whose sharp extremity's size in length and shortness is according to the size of the thickness of that skull.
And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trepans.
But the method of perforating around the fractured bone is this: that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated. Then change the drill to another place, and put between each hole a space the size of a radius' thickness, or about that.
Then cut with chisels what is between each hole of the bone: and make it thinner, as much as you can, over that end with lightness, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, either with your hand, or with any other of certain instruments, which you have prepared for that: such as forceps and fine scissors.
And it is necessary that you take every precaution so that the drill, or chisel, does not touch any of the meninges.
When, therefore, you have gone around the bone by drilling, and it has been separated from the meninges, if it was continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth the end of that which remains in the bone with another instrument similar to a chisel. However, it is necessary that it be thin and finer than other chisels.
But if any small bones and fragments remain, then remove them easily, with whatever instruments you have at hand. Then treat the wound afterwards with bandages and ointments that we have mentioned.
And another method of operation is easy, completely free from danger, which Galen described and greatly praised: and this is his account. It is necessary for you first to begin to expose the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more severe and more evident: until you expose that part and place beneath it the tip of this lenticular chisel, whose form is this.
And the lenticular, smooth part does not cut anything: and its sharp part on its two sides going lengthwise, as you see: so that the lenticular part rests on the membrane, its sharp face cutting into the bone.
Then strike upon the chisel on one side with a small mallet, until you cut the whole bone easily, as it turns: and you will be certain about the membrane, that no accident will happen to it that you would fear at all.
And if the physician were not the most foolish of men, and the most ignorant of it, nor were sleeping, then if any part of the membrane should remain attached to the bone in some places, he would cut it away from it with the tip of the same lenticular chisel, and free it from it with ease. For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the membrane, and what is cut off from the bone is its surface, and roughness and fine splinters remain in it: then it is necessary that you scrape that roughness, and eradicate those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number of various sizes, so that it is possible for you to use from them in every place the more suitable of them, and the most appropriate of them, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape. And it is necessary that you employ in your scraping, with which you first scrape the bone, the widest of those rasps. Then use after it a finer one.
And it is necessary that you employ in your scraping, with which you first scrape the bone, the widest of those rasps. Then use after it a finer one. And do not cease doing this continuously, until you come to using the thinnest and finest of them all.
In each of the remaining small hair-like fissures, and in a fine fracture, you must administer care, according to what leads to its correction.
And it is a matter which is not hidden from anyone who has any interest in this art, and who has considered what we have written and shown concerning large fractures.
But if exposed membrane is retained when you scrape the bone, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another cloth, folded double or triple, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do this as gently as you can on it, so that the patient is not burdened.
Then apply a wide bandage over it: and do not tighten it, except to the extent that it only holds the wound: and leave it with this treatment for one day, or two days, until you are safe from a hot abscess. Then loosen it, and afterwards apply medicines with which there is superfluous dryness: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and birthwort, and things similar to them: and you should make a powder from these medicines, which is sprinkled on the wound as they are dry.
And generally apply to it every medicine whose property is to cleanse and not bite. And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clean: and that there be no dirt of ointment nor filth in it.
And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clean: and that there be no dirt of ointment nor filth in it. And do not allow any pus to collect in it at all: because when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it, and makes it putrefy, and after that a great harm befalls the patient: and now it happens in the skull sutures, when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Consider therefore then, if the accidents which we have mentioned happen to the patient, know that it is undoubtedly pernicious.
And if the blackness does not occur, unless from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make that blackness: then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and smear the cloth with them. Then put it on the suture: afterwards treat it with the types of treatments which are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ On the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Know that of the nose, only its upper two parts are broken together, or one of them: because they are two bones: since its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and nothing happens to it except abrasion, and twisting, and crookedness.
If one of its two parts is broken, then it is necessary that you insert your little finger into the opening of the nose and adjust that fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and let this be done skillfully, with ease. And beware lest pain happen to the patient from your operation.
But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it: then it is necessary that it be adjusted with the end of a probe, which should be of small thickness.
But if the fracture is in both parts, then do the same thing: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible. And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the cessation of hot swelling.
Then insert into the end of the nose a tent of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two tents if the fracture is in two parts: and let the tent be of such a thickness that it fills the opening of the nose.
And some of the ancient surgeons said that the tents should be soaked in butter, and changed every day. That, however, does not seem right to me; rather, the tent should be soaked in egg white, mixed with miller's dust. Then leave the tent until the bone is set and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of a tent, after a soft cloth is wrapped around it: and it happens that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this is not necessary. If you wish, do it; and if you wish, make tents.
But if a hot abscess happens to the nose again while you are operating, plaster the nose with spurge, or with quince infused in rose oil, or with a little diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that you plaster it with sesame flour and frankincense powder prepared with egg white. Then place soft tow on it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
But if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture, or are shattered, then it is necessary that you cut over them and extract them with instruments suitable for them. Then sew the incision, and treat it with that which promotes flesh growth and strengthens from plasters suitable for it, or ointments.
But if a wound occurs within the nose, then it is necessary that you treat it with tents and administer a small lead tube until it heals.
On the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not with a wound: then examine if its fracture is only external, and not broken in two, and curved inwards: then its recognition is easy.
It is necessary, therefore, if its fracture is on the right side, that you insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth: similarly if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the hump of the fracture gently from the inside to the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone fittingly, and with it level it.
But if the fracture of the jaw is already separated in two, then it is necessary that you perform extension from both sides, according to straightness: until its setting is possible.
If, however, shaking or disruption has already occurred in the teeth, then bind those you hope will remain with a thread of gold, or silver, or silk. Then place cerate over the fractured jaw. Then place a folded cloth over it, and place over the cloth a large, properly made splint: or a piece of shoe leather of equal size, the length of the jaw.
Then bandage it from above, according to how its bandaging is prepared for you, and its application is suitable, until it is not dislodged: and order the patient to use tranquility and rest: and make his food mild sips.
But if you judge that the shape has changed in some way, then hurry and loosen it on the third day. Then correct what has been altered, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the cerate: and place soft wool over the plaster.
Therefore, while that plaster remains attached to it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it alone, do not loosen it, until it is healed: or tighten the fracture. For this fracture is very often tightened in three weeks.
But if in the meantime a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have often described for reducing it, until that abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it. For if a fragment is already separated from the bone, or from an arrowhead, then be meticulous in this, so that you remove those fragments of the arrowhead with that which is suitable for you in removing them from the instruments.
But if the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the amount of your need.
Then when you have removed those arrowheads, and nothing of them remains, sew then the opening of the wound, if it is large: and if not, place upon it from among the plasters which are suitable for it, and cause it to heal, until it is cured.
On the restoration of the Clavicle, when it is fractured.
The Clavicle is very often broken from the front part on the side of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs according to one of three ways.
For either it is broken and separated in two, besides which punctures occur in it: and this is easier to restore.
Or thus, that punctures happen in the bone: and this is more difficult for restoration.
Or thus, that there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure on it when the fracture is without a wound, is that you make two assistants present, so that one of them holds a support which follows the broken Clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Then align the fracture with your fingers, until its form is made, according to what is necessary: and let there be in it neither a protrusion nor a depression.
But if you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's armpit a ball of cloth, or wool: and let its size be according to the amount of your need: and extend, and elevate the Clavicle, and compress the ball with your hand, until you align the fracture, according to what is necessary.
But if you cannot draw the end of the Clavicle outwards: because it has gone deep: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back on his neck: and you place under his shoulder a cushion, middling in size, and let the assistant press his shoulder downwards, until the bone of the Clavicle which is deep is raised upwards: and then straighten the fracture, and align it with your fingers.
If, however, you feel a splinter of bone from the Clavicle, and it moves: then it is necessary that you cut down upon it, and extract the splinter with care.
If, however, it is retained in the bone, then contrive its incision with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the Clavicle the instrument that protects the membrane: and it is an instrument of wood, or of iron. And this is its form.
It resembles a spoon without a bowl.
And let its width be according to what you need of it from the size of the bone, and its smallness. Its length, however, also according to what is possible for you for the operation.
And let it have two ends, as you see: and let one end be wide, and the other narrow.
But if the tearing of the wound that you cut when you extracted the fractured bone is wide, and you are safe from a hot abscess, then join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
And if the tear is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and cushions according to the size of the cut of the wound.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place it over it.
A fracture of the bone, however, when it is without a wound and without a cut, is that you should place over the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white. And place soft tow over it. Then place a ball under his armpit if you need it. Then take a *himamatem*, that is, a wheel that the Saracens hold, which should be very long, and its width should be one palm, or about that. Then place a doubled cushion over the tow and plaster. Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width should be three fingers, and similarly in length. Then wrap it in cloth. Then wrap that cloth with the splint on the place of the *alhimatem* which falls over the fracture and the area. Then place the *alhimatem* over the fracture as it is rolled, and wrap it over his neck, and under his sound armpit, and under his injured armpit: and bring it back over every part, and how you see that the bandaging holds the fracture with a proper tightness: and that is what is not hidden from you, and the whole, so that the splint is not moved from over the fractured bone. And on account of this it is necessary that you examine the patient every day. Therefore, as often as the bandage loosens and you see the splint now moved: then adjust it, and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient to sleep on his back, and put a small cushion under his armpit next to his bed at night, so that with it his shoulder may be elevated on his side. Thus the fracture of the clavicle is elevated by the elevation of the shoulder.
Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage, unless something occurs in the place from itching, or from an abscess, until twelve days have passed.
Then renew the plaster, if you see its surface needs it. And tighten the bandaging, and leave him until it is restored and healed.
And indeed a fracture of the clavicle is usually consolidated and strengthened in twenty-eight days: and sometimes in certain men in less than that.
Regarding the restoration of a fracture of the shoulder blade.
The shoulder blade is rarely broken, and in its broad area; and only its edges are broken.
When, therefore, a place in it is fractured, and it is fractured in its middle, and that is not recognized except by touch: then, according to what the form of the fracture is, attempt its treatment. And bring it back to its natural shape in every ingenious way that is possible for you.
Then place on the area mill dust with egg white, and soft tow, and place over it a small cushion made of folded cloth. Then place upon it a broad splint made of thin wood according to the size of the entire shoulder blade, or a little larger than it.
But if there is a concavity beneath the splint in any place of the shoulder blade, then level that concavity with soft tow, until the splint settles evenly.
Then bandage over it with long, moderately tight, and firm bandages, until it does not move from its place.
And check the bandage every day. Therefore, whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it moves from its place: and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is indeed restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
When, therefore, this number is completed, then loosen the bandage: and you may be without worry. For it is among the bones whose joining is not feared, nor their separation.
But if a fragment projects from the bone, and pricks under the skin, then cut down upon it, and remove it. And do what we have described in the fracture of the clavicle concerning the calming of a hot abscess, if something of that sort should happen.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the breastbone.
The breastbone is sometimes broken in its middle, and that happens rarely. Indeed, its extremities are most often broken, and shattered from accidents affecting it.
When its middle, which slopes toward the lower parts, is broken, and severe pain happens to it, and difficulty in breathing, and a cough: and perhaps he vomits blood, and a concavity is evident in the broken bone, and is not hidden from the senses, its restoration is as follows: that the sick person be laid on his back: and place a cushion between his shoulder blades.
Then press his shoulders and bring together the ribs from both sides or flanks with the hands: and be subtle in setting it, in every way that is possible and appropriate, until the shape of the bone returns, as it should be.
Then place a plaster and padding over it, and place over it a splint of a thin board of willow, or of tin, and similar light materials, after you have wrapped it in cloth. Then take care in binding it over the broken bone, so that it does not move: and go with the bandage around to the back several times, and tighten it with a moderate tightness.
Then check the bandaging at every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if necessity compels its loosening due to itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or an abscess: then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has happened with the appropriate method of treating it.
Then reapply the plaster, if you see a need for it: and apply the bandaging to it, until it is healed.
¶ On the restoration of ribs, when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur, except in the thick places which follow the back, and at their ends on the front side. And they are not subject to wearing down, except because they are cartilaginous. And the recognition of it is not hidden from the senses upon examination with the fingers.
And its restoration is done thus, that you adjust the fracture with the fingers in the most feasible manner, until the shape is made even, as is necessary. Then apply plasters, and bind the broken bone with a splint, if it requires it.
And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inwards: then the patient experiences severe pain, and a pricking sensation, like the pricking that occurs in someone who has pleurisy: because the bone punctures the membrane, and also he experiences difficulty breathing, and coughing, and vomiting much blood: and this is difficult to treat.
And indeed the ancients devised many ingenious methods for it: and among them are those who say that you should give the patient foods which generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly may be inflamed, and distended, and push the fracture outwards.
We, however, shrink from this, lest it quickly cause a hot abscess, if one has not already occurred. But if one has already occurred, then it adds to it.
And some of them said: let a cupping glass be placed over the area, then let it suck strongly, and this is more similar to reason. Nevertheless, it is feared that the cupping glass may attract excess fluids to the area, due to its weakened state.
And some of them said: the area must be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil, and cushions should be placed between the ribs until it is filled out, so that the bandaging is even when you wrap it around.
Then the patient should be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
But if something severe constricts the patient, which he cannot bear, and the bone pricks the covering with a painful prick, and we fear for the patient, then we must cut over the area and uncover the fractured rib. Then we should place over it the instrument that preserves the periosteum, which was mentioned earlier: and we should cut the bone gently, and incise it.
Then we bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, and treat it with plasters until it heals.
But if in the meantime a hot abscess develops, then hurry and soak small cushions in rose oil and place them over the area, and the patient should be treated as is suitable for an abscess.
Meanwhile, he should also lie on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
On the restoration of a fracture of the dorsal and cervical vertebrae.
Indeed, sometimes a fracture happens to the bones of the neck, and rubbing/chafing rarely happens to them: and similarly also to the vertebrae of the back. Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you want to know whether he will be healed or not, then consider. For if you see his hands already softened, numb, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor clench them: and when you clench them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and he does not feel pain in them: then you should know that he will not be healed, and in most cases it is fatal.
But if he moves them, and feels in them the clenching with the fingers and the pricking: then know that the nape of the neck/spinal cord is safe, and that the patient will be healed with treatment.
But if something similar to this happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you want to know whether it will also be healed or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and what happened in the hands happens in them: then when he lies on his back, flatulence and excrement come out involuntarily: and when he is turned over onto his stomach, excrement comes out involuntarily: and when he is turned onto his back, and he wants to urinate, and he cannot: then know that it is fatal. Therefore, do not work on his treatment.
But if none of that happens to him, the matter is less serious.
And the treatment for what happens from it is that you try the soothing of a hot abscess: in such a way that you place only crushed rose oil on the vertebra: or with the yolks of a roasted egg.
Place that on it several times a day, until such a time as the hot abscess subsides: then place one of the strengthening and drying plasters on the area, and bandage it firmly: and tell the patient to employ rest and quiet. And he should not sleep on the side where he experiences the pain, until he is healed.
But if, in the fractured bone, a fragment occurs, or something that has already separated from it, then you must cut through the skin, and remove it. Then join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture. Then treat it with some promoting-flesh unguent, until it is healed.
If indeed the end of the coccyx bone is broken, and it is the end of the tailbone, then you must insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus, and straighten the fractured bone with your other hand, as best you can, and after proper alignment.
Then put a dressing over it, and remove it, and treat the wound with the aforementioned treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the hip.
Chapter 11.
Hip bones are rarely broken. But if they are broken, then their fracture is nothing other than a shattering at their extremities: and they are split lengthwise, and they bend inwards: and the patient suffers pain in the area, and a pricking sensation: and the broken leg becomes numb.
And its restoration is indeed, that you extend your hand upon it, until you determine the shape of the fracture.
But if the fracture is only at its extremities, then adjust that fracture, according to what is available to you for setting, until its natural shape is restored.
However, if the fracture is lengthwise, or now bends inwards, then have the patient lie on his stomach, until you can reduce that fracture. When you have set it, then apply a plaster on it: then place a splint made of wood or leather upon it: and bind it firmly, but not so tightly that you fear displacement of the fracture or movement of the splint.
And fill their hollow with something that will fill it, until the bandage holds it evenly: and tell the patient to sleep on his back, or on his uninjured side.
But if a hot abscess develops, then stop extending and setting it until the hot abscess subsides; and apply something to it which soothes it, as described previously, then return to setting it, and bind it as is necessary.
But if it happens in the sagittal suture, or it is shattered, extract it.
On the Repair of a Fracture of the Shoulder Blade.
The shoulder blade is that which is between the elbow and the head of the scapula.
If, therefore, it is fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to the following shape.
And at the two ends two straps are tied.
Then it is hung from a high place: and the patient sits on a seat. Then he places his broken arm upon the wood, until he comes to the armpit, in the middle of which the curve of the wood should be located.
Then you hang something heavy above him so that the assistant extends it downwards. Then the doctor sets the fracture with his hands at the same time, until the fracture returns as it should.
And another method is that the patient lies on his back: and you suspend his hand from his neck with a bandage. Then order two assistants, so that one of them holds what is above the fracture with his hands: and so that the other holds what is below it, and each of them extends it to his side.
And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind beneath the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage: and let each of the two assistants extend it to their two sides.
If, therefore, the fracture is near the end of the shoulder, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed under the armpit, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a bandage be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Then adjust the fracture with ease without force, until when the fracture is adjusted as is necessary, and it is applied with a good application: then bind it, if a hot swelling does not occur.
But if a hot swelling occurs, then loosen the bandaging until the seventh day. And put upon it greasy wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the swelling subsides: then bind it: and the way of binding it is, that you put a plaster over the fracture.
Then put a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster. Then support the arm on a helper, and let him place his hand spread open on his shoulder.
And put a cloth, and bind the arm upon the support, so that the arm stays in the place of the splints: unless something prevents you from that, or something from the broken bone changes for the worse on you.
But if you fear that something from the broken bone will shift on you, then use splints: and this is how, you place over the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints. And put between each splint the width of a finger: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
Then bind over the splints with the binding that I described in the beginning of the chapter.
And your binding should be tighter over the place of the fracture. And the more the fracture extends, the less tight the binding should be.
Therefore, if you see the placement of the splints and the bandaging, as we have described, at the time when you immediately restore the limb, then proceed: and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave off the bandaging and splints until the seventh day, as we have described.
Then examine the bandaging every three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur in that place, or food is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the excessive tightness of the bandaging. Therefore, correct all of that, according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not loosen the bandage, except after three days, or more.
And let the patient sleep on his back, and his hand on his stomach: and place under the armpit a cushion evenly filled with wool.
And take care, at every hour of the night or day, that the shape of the fractured limb is not disturbed, or the bandage loosened. Therefore, correct all of that with your skill.
And arrange the patient's food according to the order we have previously described, so that the food is light at first, until the bone begins to knit: then it is necessary that you increase the richness of his food.
For it is the usual practice for the humerus and the leg to knit in forty days: then it is necessary that it be unbandaged, and a bath administered, and medicated with ointments which strengthen it.
But if the fracture was severe, crushed: then do not remove the bandage and splints from it for up to fifty days, and up to two months.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two radius bones.
One of which is small: and that is the one that follows the thumb. And the other is large, and is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Perhaps, therefore, the larger radius bone is broken alone, or the small one: and perhaps they are broken together.
When, therefore, the small radius is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the lower radius is broken, its fracture is bad and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
If, therefore, the bone that is broken is the small radius above, then it is fitting for the physician, at its restoration, to apply a little extension gently until he makes it even.
But if it is the large radius that is broken, then it is necessary that he apply much stronger binding.
And it is necessary that he place the form of the hand at its restoration, and its extension extended over a cushion. And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be below all the fingers, or the rest; and the patient sits squarely upon himself, and let the cushion be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height, so that the patient does not experience difficulty.
Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand, or with a bandage. And let another assistant extend it from above in a similar manner.
Then let the physician align the bone until he restores it to the best possible shape.
But if in the fracture of the bone there are fragments, then endeavor to return each fragment to its place with your skill.
But if a separated fragment appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope for you in its restoration: then cut down upon it, and remove it according to the method we have described in the things that have been mentioned before.
However, if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter for that, so take the treatment for it from there.
But if at the beginning of your restoration a hot swelling should occur, then smear a cloth with a cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth upon it with a light bandage, until when the swelling subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with egg white. Then apply splints, and let the splint which is placed over the fracture itself be a little wider, and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most situations, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
Then place your bandaging over the site of the fracture more strongly and firmly, and somewhat more so with the bandaging above the fracture, or below it: or place the bandaging a little more loosely than its bandaging, according to what was mentioned previously at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist cloths, and not hard, rough ones. And let the thread with which it is tied be specifically of linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have explained.
And examine the limb and the bandaging after [some] days. But if something happens which needs correcting, such as an itching that occurs in the limb: then it is necessary that you bathe the limb with warmed water, until that itching subsides, and you leave the limb unbandaged, until it rests, then repeat the bandaging.
But if the bandaging has now loosened, and the bone has now shifted, and things similar to these: then correct all of it by your skill, and examine [it] again.
For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of excessive tightness of the bandaging, then it is necessary that you loosen it a little, and leave it for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, then bandage it.
But if none of those things which we have mentioned happen to the patient, then it is not necessary that it be unbandaged, except after twenty days, or approximately that.
Then the hand of the patient should be suspended from his neck. And let his neck be level, and let him be guarded by his own strength from agitated movements. And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days. All of this is according to the dispositions of constitutions, and the dispositions of strength.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Know that a fracture rarely happens to the metacarpus of the hand, and to the knuckles of the fingers. And it does not happen to it, unless by frequent rubbing.
When, therefore, a fracture or bruise happens to the metacarpus, then it is necessary that the patient sit squarely, and that a seat be before him at an equal height. Then place his hand upon it outstretched.
Then the assistant should extend the broken bones, and the physician align them, until they are joined together in a good union.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and tow, unless a hot abscess occurs. Then place a splint over it according to the size of the area, and you have now wrapped it in a linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the lower part near the arch of the foot, then make something like a ball from cloth, and instruct the patient to press upon it with his fractured foot; then it should be bandaged with a long cloth.
And the splint should be made of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather is applied to the sole of the foot, and tighten it as needed.
However, if the fracture is on the outer side, then it is necessary to put a splint on top, and another splint below on the sole of the foot; and the hand should be open and straight. Then apply a bandage, as the hand is turned, and extend between the fingers with a tie.
But if a fracture of any of the joints of the fingers happens, then if it is the thumb, it should be set as needed. Then it should be bandaged with a splint; and if you wish, apply a small, straight splint to it, so that the fracture is elevated and is not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, and index, or little, and ring fingers, then it should be set, and bound with the neighboring healthy finger: or they may all be bound together in a row: and that is better. Or place upon it a small splint, as we said regarding the thumb.
And consider in your treatment, and after it, the possibility of a hot abscess, and treat it accordingly, when something like that occurs, according to what has repeatedly been explained.
¶ On the treatment of a fracture of the hip.
The hip bone is frequently broken, and this is evident to the senses, since it turns inward and backward.
And its treatment is done thus: that a bandage is tightened above the fracture, and another bandage below the fracture. And the patient is laid on his face.
Then let each bandage be extended by the assistant to his side in an even manner; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let there be a bandage at the area of the pubis so that the extension is made upward: and another bandage below the fracture.
And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let there be a bandage near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Then the physician aligns the bone with both his hands, until he restores it according to the likeness of its natural shape: and the bone is joined with a good joining.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandaging, if an abscess does not occur in the limb. But if an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for a few days until the hot abscess subsides, then return to your treatment.
Moreover, its bandaging should be thus. It is necessary that you wrap a stiff linen cloth, that is, a bandage, over the fracture: and fold it twice, or three times: and let some excess remain. Then wrap the leg until you reach the heel at the base of the buttock.
And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part on both sides. Then wrap what remains of the linen cloth over the leg and the hip.
Then place splints over the hip at the location of the fracture itself, and place one of these splints over the bone of the leg.
Then fill the empty spaces between the leg and the hip with soft cloths, so that the bandaging is even.
Then begin with tight bandaging from the middle over the location of the fracture with three or four turns. And the further you extend with the bandage from the location of the fracture, the less tight, softer, and gentler your bandaging should be.
Then pull on the two ends of the thread, which you inserted between the hip and the leg. Therefore, tie the three splints that are on top with both (ends). Then go with the two ends of the thread downwards, until you reach the ankle of the foot. And with both (ends), also tighten the ends of the splints on the other side: so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
Then loosen the tightening over it, while it remains, so that neither corrosion, nor abscess, nor swelling, and things similar to them, happen to the limb. But if any of those things happen. Therefore, hurry with its loosening, and completely correct that which resulted from it, according to what we have said many times.
But if there is a fragment of bone in the bone that pricks: then it is necessary that you smooth it, if it is possible for you. And if not, cut over it, and remove it: and treat it with that whose account preceded, until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, besides splints being added to it, as we have said regarding the forearm and arm.
However, in the restoration of it thus broken, lameness does not happen to the patient. And if it is restored by itself, besides the other leg being applied to it, then it is necessary that the one whose it is will always limp.
And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is subtracted: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions, and other dispositions.
Regarding the restoration of a fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely happens, but a bruise happens to it very often.
But if a fracture does happen to it, then it is nothing other than either a fissure or a hole in its parts. And this is with a wound, and without a wound. And all of this is observed with sensation.
And its restoration is thus, that what has been broken apart of its parts is made even with the fingers, until it is gathered together, and joined according to what is possible of alignment and ease, and making.
Then place a plaster of sesame flour, or of a mill, with egg white: and put upon it a round splint, if you need it: and bind over it a bandage suitable for that.
Then consider all the conditions that we have described in the other fractures: such as a hot abscess, and things similar to it: thus, so that you may oppose each incident with that which suits it, until it is healed.
On the restoration of a fracture of the leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, of which one is thick, and is called by the name of the leg: and the other is thin, and is called the fibula.
And it happens to both of them from the types of fracture what happens to the two bones of the arm: and because of that its restoration is done, just as the restoration of the arm equally, and the procedure is one.
But if the two bones are broken at the same time, the leg is turned to all sides.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg turns to the front part.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it lower: and it is among those that are not hidden from you.
Then administer extension, and setting, and binding of splints accordingly, equally.
However, it is necessary, if the fracture of the leg is a severe fracture, having much inflammation, that the extension be less and more gentle with your alleviation.
And indeed in the leg there is something in the procedure beyond the arm: and it is, that when you set the splints, and complete all your work, then take two strips from pine wood, which is used in making the ceilings that are placed under the boards: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from those that are of small thickness, and yet not from the smallest: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Then wrap upon each one cloth with two windings along its length. And place one on one side of the leg, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Then tie the two strips in three places, at the two ends and the middle. For when tightening is prevented, the leg bends to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
And now indeed let a splint of wood be prepared according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it preserves it from movement.
And indeed it is mostly necessary that you do this in a fracture when it is accompanied by a wound specifically.
Then examine the leg every day, and attend to it with the utmost care regarding an abscess, or swelling, or other such things. If, therefore, any of these things occur, then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed, God willing.
On the fracture of the bones of the foot, and of the toes.
The heel bone, indeed, is not completely fractured.
The bones of the foot are sometimes fractured, and the toes are also rarely fractured: and they suffer no more than a bruise in most cases.
But if a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs, and you see those bones raised above each other, then let the patient place his foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Then stand, and place your foot on that which is raised up from those bones: then press, or tread on it: and adjust it until it returns to its place.
Then apply a plaster, and tow on top: and place under the sole of the foot a small board, which has two flat ends.
Then bind it with the foot with a suitable bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths, and other things which it needs.
Therefore, when three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage. For you will find the bones aligned, whether they were fractured or dislocated. The procedure for them, therefore, is as you see.
But if any of the toes are broken, then restore them and align them according to what I have told you regarding the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place on your toe a splint along the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider than it: then place under the foot this board which I told you about, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
But if what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place upon each toe a splint of its size, wrapped in a linen cloth: and bind the board to the bottom of the foot: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the arch of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
And it is fitting for you not to forget to consider everything that I told you in the other fractures from the accidents which we have discussed: and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
Regarding the fracture of the woman's vulva, and the pubic bone, and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, then have her sit squarely. Then incline her somewhat toward the part of her back, and let her be held from behind.
Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton until she fills it: and let it be made in the vulva from it like a sphere.
Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back little by little. For that cotton comes out, until it becomes before the opening of the vulva like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns.
Then place a small cushion upon her back. When, therefore, she wants to urinate, let her remove the cotton with ease, then let her urinate: and replace it in the same way that you inserted it initially: then let her return to her first cushion.
Let her do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself is restored.
And if you wish, take the bladder of a sheep, and tighten on its opening a small tube of reed, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva. Then blow into the small tube forcefully until the bladder is inflated within the vulva, for the fracture returns (to place).
Then let it be filled with cotton, and let it remain for several days, according to what we have described, until it is healed.
And when the pubic bone of a man, or of a woman, is broken, then employ for its restoration, and its setting, what we have described for the hip bone.
And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially to one who has some knowledge or experience.
And understand this book of mine well, because the fracture itself shows you in most cases the right way to restore and bind it: therefore, understand.
But when the penis of a man is fractured, take the neck of a goose and insert the penis into it. Then place over it a wrapping of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and left for three days, or about that, and it will be healed, if God wills.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of bones when it is with a wound.
It is fitting for him who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or shoulder blade, or similar to it, that you hurry and phlebotomize him immediately, if the conditions for phlebotomy are favorable, as we have stated before.
But if the wound is flowing with blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to staunch it, so that you sprinkle over it ground alum, if you do not have anything else at hand.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not postpone it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides. And do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for you would cause bad complications to occur.
But if the broken bone is protruding above the exposed skin, then it is necessary that you try to reduce it and level it with your hands, with ease and gentle extension.
But if its extension and leveling cannot be achieved with your hands, then reduce it with this instrument. And it is an instrument that is made of iron, whose length is the measure of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound. And for that reason, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, according to the quantity that he needs for the treatment in each kind of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it have a slight thickness so that it will not bend when compressed during the operation, and let it have a pointed tip with an edge at its extremity. And let its upper part be thick from its middle down to its lower part.
And this is its form.
In this operation, it is necessary that its curved pointed end be placed on the end of the protruding bone: and push it with this once, until the bone returns and is leveled somewhat.
Therefore, try to align the ends of the fracture together.
But if its broken end is thin, and the instrument does not grip it well, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it.
If, however, you are completely unable to reduce them with what we have described, then cut it with a suitable knife from among the cutting instruments we have mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way you can.
Then scrape off whatever roughness and small fragments remain on the bone.
When, therefore, the bone is reduced, and the patient experiences severe, distressing pain after its reduction, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Therefore, do this. For you render great assistance to the patient, when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Then soak a cloth in dark, astringent wine. And especially if it is in summer. And do not put carrot or anything containing oil on the wound, lest it cause putrefaction and decay.
Then apply splints when you have finished the restoration of the bone. And leave the wound uncovered: however, you should cut a hole in the bandages with scissors according to the size of the wound.
And take every precaution not to constrict the wound with the fracture. For foolish physicians have often done this and have caused either death, or corrosion, or pus in their patients. And let your bandaging be soft, gentle, unlike the bandaging of other fractures.
But if the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some of the bad complications concerning it which we have described, and you find the pain in the area suspended: then you should not put splints on it. And make for them bandages from hard cloths in place of splints and bind it with them.
However, when it is after one day or two days and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus, then remove from it the cloth which you placed on it with wine. Then administer bandages and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and things similar to it.
And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage. And examine the wound every day, morning and evening, until it heals and is cured.
And it is necessary that the limb be arranged in such a way that pus runs from it downwards with ease.
But if many days pass by the wound, and it neither heals nor is the pus cut off from it, then you should know that there are small chips of bone there. Therefore it is necessary that you examine the wound with a probe. And however many of those small bone fragments are loose, remove them and extract them. And those of them which are not loose, and prick the limb, and cause pain, try to cut into them and remove them in every way that is possible for you.
But if there should occur in the wound erysipelas or a malignant ulcer, that is, a corroding ulcer, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary that you treat each of them with the appropriate cure, the account of which has preceded in its own chapter.
And on which it is necessary that my discussion should dwell, and to which you should give your present attention, when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip bone and the shoulder blade, and similar large limbs, is that you do not attempt its extraction, for death often occurs from that, but rather leave it until it rots.
For perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty days or thirty.
Then therefore treat the wound, if it seems good to you, and if not, leave it.
On the treatment of a knot in the track of a fracture.
This knot often occurs in the track of the healing of a fracture. Especially one that is near the joints: and the shape of the limb is made ugly by it. And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Consider then, if the node is recent: apply to it medications that have astringency, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things.
So that you take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and put them on the node in tow, and bind them tightly upon it with a good bandage.
And leave the bandage, and do not loosen it for many days. Then loosen it, and apply another, until the node is removed.
Or tighten a lead plate appropriately over it. For lead has the property of removing anything harmful from the limbs.
But if the node has already turned into stone, and is hard, and necessity urgently compels its removal: then cut into it from the upper part of it, and incise the protruding excess: or scrape it with certain scrapers, until it is removed: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ On the treatment when it is restored, and the limb remains afterward thin, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is restored, and the limb remains afterward thin, weak: then that does not happen except for many reasons. One of which is, excessive loosening of the bandage and its tying not as it should be: or because of excessive tightness of the bandages, so that nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb: or because of excessive embrocation at the wrong time: or because of a lack of blood in the patient's body, and his weakness.
And the treatment for this is to nourish the patient, and to soften his body, until the blood in him increases. And administer a bath. And introduce joy and happiness upon him.
Then place pitch upon the limb: so that the pitch may attract much nourishment to it. And he should diligently apply a fomentation of it with tepid water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly.
When crookedness and a protrusion or knot occurs in a limb already restored after its healing to a fractured bone, and the form of the limb is disfigured by it, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural function: then you should not accept the opinion of him who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
And already there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters, who have done this in our land.
And this procedure is indeed very reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, that it may be fatal.
But if the lameness and knot are recent, then it is necessary that it be fomented with tepid water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as leaves of marshmallow, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones. And a plaster should be made for it with a softening plaster, such as diachylon properly made.
Or, mucilage of marshmallow root should be taken, and shaken with chicken fat or sesame oil, and it should be plastered with it.
Or, ripe figs should be taken and ground with pigeon dung, and similar things which are named among the medications that reduce solidification.
And sometimes the knot is loosened with frequent, long-standing, and gentle rubbing, which is done with moistened hands. And movement of the limb should be administered in every direction at all times.
But if the crookedness has already been present and has become strong, and has turned into bone, and the necessity for its treatment with iron has been brought about: then it is necessary that above it be cut, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and what is superfluous of the knot or bone be cut away with fine scalpels: and that ease in that be administered with care and attention.
Concerning the discussion on dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its place. Therefore it is prevented from its motion, and the shape of the limb is disfigured. And it causes severe pains and injuries to happen to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hurry to its restoration, and not delay it at all.
For if it is delayed, the place will fester, and perhaps with it, the reduction of the dislocation.
For that reason, therefore, it is not appropriate for it to be moved, nor extended at the time of its festering. Because it very often causes spasms and harmful pains to occur.
But when that happens, then it is necessary for you to hurry to the phlebotomy of the patient. Then let it be left alone, until the abscess subsides.
Then the limb should be fomented with warm water and oil. Then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated with that whose recollection will come in its place.
I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocation, also according to what preceded concerning fracture, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws are rarely dislocated.
And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways. For either they are moved from their places by a small displacement, and are softened a little. Or they are dislocated completely, until they are loosened toward the chest, until the patient's saliva runs, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is hampered in speech.
However, when the dislocation is minor, then in many situations it returns by itself with little effort.
But if the dislocation is complete, total, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and the assistant should hold the patient's head: and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the dislocated jaw inside his mouth if the dislocation is on one side. Or he should insert both thumbs at the same time if the dislocation is on both sides. And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he applies even pressure.
And instruct the patient to exercise his jaws, and move them to chew in every direction. And the physician should align the jaw, and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are [dislocated] at the same time: then administer steaming with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
When therefore they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed, and they are not loose: then place over them small cushions of cloth, with cerate which is made from wax and rose oil.
Then they should be bound gently with soft bandages.
And let the patient's sleep be on his back: and let his head be positioned between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor try, or be forced to chew anything: rather let his food be a smooth soup, until, when the pains are removed, and the jaw is strengthened: then he may eat what he wants, and this should be administered with care.
He should not exert his mouth while eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is strengthened and healed.
But if the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at some point, and they do not return to their places: then fevers and continuous hiccups often occur from this: and perhaps the patient's bowels loosen, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Therefore, when you see this, then know that it is fatal, and often he to whom this happens dies within ten days.
¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the extremity of the humerus.
The clavicle is indeed not dislocated from the inner side, because of its connection with the chest. And it is sometimes dislocated outwardly, and this is clear to the senses.
And its restoration is thus: that the patient lie on his back and extend his arms. Then compress the place with your palm firmly, for it will return.
Then place upon it a plaster and pads and bind it.
The extremities, however, which follow the elbow and are continuous with it are not dislocated, except rarely. But if it is dislocated someday, then it is necessary that it be reduced and set according to what we have said, and what is prepared for you.
Then put on it a plaster, and pads, and a bandage. And order the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest, until he is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the shoulder is reduced, when it is also separated from its place.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder.
Know that the shoulder is not dislocated, except according to three ways.
One of which is, that it be dislocated towards the armpit downwards. The second is, that it be dislocated towards the chest. And sometimes it is dislocated towards the upper part of the shoulder: and that happens rarely.
And it is not dislocated backwards, because of the shoulder blade. And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the sinews/tendons.
And indeed it is mostly dislocated and comes out downwards toward the armpit: especially in those whose flesh is scanty. Since it comes out in them quickly, and goes in quickly.
However, in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, namely because it comes out with difficulty, and goes in with difficulty.
And perhaps a blow or a fall happens to some men, and the Humerus is infected with a hot abscess, and it is thought because of that, that it is now dislocated.
It is necessary, therefore, that you examine it until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is below toward the armpit: and you should distinguish between the dislocated Humerus and the healthy humerus. For you find a manifest difference between them, and you find a concavity in the head of the Humerus, and under the armpit, to the touch, the head of the humerus is as if it were an egg: and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all ways.
And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you will find the touch manifest, nor is it hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is indeed easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
And its reduction is that the assistant raises his hand upwards. Then place your thumbs under his armpit, and strongly raise the joint upwards to its place: and let the assistant raise his hand and extend it upwards. Then he should place it lower, for it will return quickly.
But if it does not return by what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if roots of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Then the patient is laid on his back, and a ball of wool, which is between soft and tight, is placed under his armpit.
Then the physician should place his heel upon the ball, and forcefully raise the head of the humerus, and draw the patient's hand downwards.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: have present a man who is taller than the patient, and let him stand at the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift his armpit upwards, until the patient is suspended in the air. And another assistant should pull the patient's hand down towards his abdomen. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, to weigh him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reduced according to another method: that is, a long piece of wood is fixed in the ground, the top of which is round in shape: like the handle of a pestle: which is neither thick nor thin. Then it should be placed under the patient after soft cloths have been placed over the top of the wood, and the patient stands along the length of the wood.
Then his hand is extended downwards on one side, and his body is extended forcefully on the other side: for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But if its reduction is difficult by all the methods we have described, then use this treatment: namely, that you take a piece of wood whose length is the measure of two arms, and its width the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers, which has a round head, so that its entry into the depths of the armpit is eased, according to this form.
Then soft cloths are tied over the rounded head so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Then it is placed under the patient's armpit, so that the hand, or arm, is extended over the wood downwards: and the wood is tied over the upper arm and forearm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm is placed over the step of a ladder widthwise, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging on the other side. For the joint goes in immediately.
When, therefore, its entry is completed in whatever way possible, then it is necessary that you place a ball of wool of equal size under the armpit. Then apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with frankincense, and egg white over the whole shoulder, just as it turns over on itself.
Then bind moderately tightly under the armpit, and the bandage is rolled over the plaster from above, and his hand is tied to his neck, and it is left, and his hand is not moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that little food be given to the patient, until the limb is strengthened: since this is quicker for its healing.
Then after seven days, or five, a larger bandage is put on, and is exercised with movement. If therefore it becomes firm and is not softened, then it is now healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture which occurs in it, or because of some other cause: then it is necessary that it be treated with a cautery with three holes, according to what was stated previously in the chapter on cautery.
But if all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and bandaging are replaced on it several times, and it is not strengthened, and it falls, and he cannot raise it to the upper parts: then know that its sinews which are at the head of the shoulder, are now cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The reduction, however, of a dislocation which occurs toward the chest and breast, or toward the back, is done with pressing and extending with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining bandaging and treatment is administered to it, until it is healed.
But if heaviness occurs in the limb after healing, and slowness in its movement, then let the patient use the bath frequently, until that heaviness is relieved, and it returns to its original state.
On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and likewise returns with difficulty: and it is indeed dislocated to all sides, and especially to the front, or to the back.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it is falling under sight, and under touch, in whatever way it is dislocated. And when you compare the dislocated elbow with a healthy one, it is clearly revealed to you. For the joint is hollowed, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder with it.
And you must hurry, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess happens to it.
For if a hot abscess happens to it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it is not healed at all, especially when it is to the rear. For it is the worst of all kinds of dislocation, and of more vehement pain to them: and often death comes down with it.
And its restoration, when it is among those that are possible to reduce, is that his hand be extended with two hands: and his arm be stretched out, and the physician's hands be above the elbow and below it, and he himself push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he doubles the hand with his hand, until he strikes with the base of his palm the elbow that is dislocated.
But if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer strong, very forceful extension: and it is that two assistants extend the arm: and two assistants also hold it, so that it is not moved during the extension.
Then the arm is rotated in every direction after a long, doubled cloth, or a broad bandage, is wrapped around his hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil: so that it may be among those things which assist in the lubrication of the joint with ease. Then let him push the joint with a strong push, until it returns.
And after its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it, in which there is astringency and desiccation with egg white: and it is bandaged with a suitable bandage. And the arm is suspended from the patient's neck, and left for a few days.
Then it is loosened. If, therefore, the joint is firm in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and leave it.
And if you see the joint is not well joined, then repeat the plaster and the bandaging, and leave it for several days, until it is joined. Then loosen it.
But if heaviness happens to it after the reduction of the joint, and the disposition is to move: then administer moistening by bathing, and gentle rubbing, and compression, until it is relieved, or place upon the joint of the ilium, that is, the fat of a ram's buttock. Then let it be bandaged, and leave it on it for a day and a night. Then remove it, and put him into the bath. When, therefore, he sweats, then rub the joint with a moderate rubbing. Then repeat on it the ram's buttock once, and a second time, and a third time with entry into the bath, until it is relieved.
And if you wish, put on it moist cow dung, warmed with butter, and bind it on it.
Do this several times. For it is relieved and returns to its proper condition.
On the treatment of dislocation of the jaw.
The wrist is frequently dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the forearm and hand.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy. Unlike the other joints. However, it is necessary that there be swiftness in the reduction of its dislocation at the time in which it is dislocated, before the place swells up, or a hot swelling occurs in it.
And the reduction of the dislocation in it is as follows: you should place the wrist of the weak hand on a board, and an assistant should extend its hand, and the physician should place his palm upon the prominence of the joint, and press it until it returns.
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm now recedes toward the inside of the hand: then the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board at the time of extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding toward the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inward upon the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed upon the board, so that the hand of the physician falls upon the prominence itself of the joint.
If therefore it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster that soothes swelling, and leave it alone, and do not repeat the procedure.
For if it does not tolerate it, and you are not able to reduce it, after some days have passed, nevertheless the joint remains in its crooked state: and it does not harm the patient at all, except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything: then you should know that the nerves have been severed, or worn away.
There is therefore no remedy in this case, except to cauterize it near the site of the injury. And perhaps this will not be of any benefit.
When, therefore, the setting does not reset, then place upon it the plaster that we have described. Then it should be bound, and left for five days: afterwards it should be unbound and left free, and the hand exercised.
But if its movement is hindered, and some serious condition occurs in it: then soften it with warm water and rubbing several times, until it is relieved.
¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
When one of the fingers is dislocated in any direction, either backwards towards the back of the hand, or forwards towards the palm: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns (to its place).
Then support the tip of the finger, and stretch it towards the direction in which it was dislocated, and leave it like this for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it becomes straight again on that day.
When night comes, bandage it as described previously, and don't fail to unbind it during the day; and exercise it with movement, and bandage it again at night.
Do this for several days, until it is strengthened.
And do likewise with it if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and bandage it to that side, and perform your initial procedure on it, until it is healed.
And similarly, do so with it when it is dislocated to the other sides.
On the treatment of dislocation of the dorsal vertebrae.
When a complete dislocation of the dorsal vertebrae or neck happens to someone, or many vertebrae are moved from their places, then there is no cure in it, because death comes quickly to the sick person.
And the sign of that is that the patient's excrement comes out involuntarily, and they cannot hold it: and often some of their limbs are weakened because of it, or both their legs, or both their arms, or one of them: or one vertebra is moved from its place.
Indeed, it is often dislocated, because their dislocation often occurs in four directions.
Therefore, that which is dislocated posteriorly is called a hump.
The treatment of it, indeed, is that you then consider if the hump arises from childhood: then there is no treatment in it, nor any healing from it at all.
But in that which happens from a fall, or a blow, or similar things, the ancients have already described methods of treatment in lengthy discourse. Most of which does not return with benefit.
I, however, have now abbreviated from that, a little of which excuses much of it from its proximity to my purpose: and by my explanation by which I have explained it, and have fashioned its instrument in a different way from that by which they showed it and explained it.
I say, therefore, that in a hump which happens from the front part, there is no remedy, nor healing from it.
And similarly in that which happens to both sides also.
And none of them are treated, except that which occurs on the back properly, with what I describe: and that is, that the patient be stretched out on his face on a level platform near a wall: and damp straw be spread under him so that his chest is not injured.
Then a straight piece of wood, fixed in a hole in the ground, should be placed at the end of the platform, near his head: and another piece of wood near his feet at the other end of the platform: and an assistant should hold the wood, and it should not be fixed in the hole. And another assistant should hold the other one.
Then wrap a soft, strong bandage over the patient's head and under his armpits: and extend the end of the bandage to the piece of wood that is at his head: and tie it to it.
Then tighten another bandage above his hips, and above his knees, and around his ankles. Then gather all the bandages, and tie them to the other piece of wood which is at his feet.
Then each assistant should stretch the bandage towards the end of the piece of wood, and the two pieces of wood should not be moved from the places in which they are fixed: however, they should not be fixed, as we have said.
And the physician should place his palms on the vertebra with force, until it returns (to place): or place a board on it. Then he ties his feet over the board until it returns (to place).
But if it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits. And hollow out in the wall, which we mentioned is near the patient, a place into which the end of the board may enter. Then place the middle of the board over the vertebra. And let the physician place his feet on the other end. And let him press firmly, until the vertebra is compressed, and returns to its place.
Then if you wish, work with a winch which is turned with your hand: and it is thus, that you fix in the ground near the patient's head at the foot of the support two pieces of wood, whose length is one cubit: and near his head at the foot of the support two pieces of wood.
And let the length which is between each piece of wood be one palm: and now in each place a hole is made, in which the winch runs: and let each piece of wood be fixed firmly in the ground, so that it does not move at all.
And let a round piece of wood be inserted: and it is a winch on which a cord is wound in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end is a hole, in which is fixed a piece of wood, whose length is a palm including that which is turned: and in the two other pieces of wood it is similarly the same.
Then tighten the cords which you tightened on the patient's chest with the winch which is at his head: and the cords which you tightened on his legs with the winch which is at his feet.
Then let an assistant stand at each winch, who turns his hand with the handle with which the winch is turned: and let the physician set the vertebra straight, as we have described.
This is the form of the winch, which follows.
Then after the vertebra returns and the place is made even, then it is necessary that you place a drying plaster with egg white. Then tow. Afterwards place over the plaster a splint made from a board, whose width should be three fingers, or about that. And its length an amount that covers the place of the hump, and over part of the healthy vertebra.
Then it is bandaged with the bandage that we spoke of. And the patient should use a light diet until he is healed.
But if some amount of protrusion remains at the site at the end of healing: then it is necessary that softening and soothing medications be administered, with the application of the board that we described for a long time. And now a sheet of lead is applied to it.
And sometimes a protrusion occurs at the last of the dorsal vertebrae: and a dislocation is thought to exist because of it, and it is this bone which is now prominent. Therefore, this treatment should not be attempted on him, for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the joints of the hip and the joints of the shoulder experience only dislocation: and they do not experience what happens to other joints from slight displacement and concavity.
And indeed the hip joint is dislocated in four directions. That is, because it is dislocated forwards and backwards.
And indeed it is most often dislocated inwards; and it is rarely dislocated forwards and backwards.
And the treatment of its dislocation inwards is this: when you join the leg of the unwell person level with the unwell leg, it is longer: and their knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the unwell person cannot bend their foot at the groin: and the place that follows the groin is swollen with a hot swelling, because the head of the hip has now arrived there.
And the sign of him who has suffered a dislocation outwards is that his symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And the sign of him who has suffered a dislocation forwards is that he extends the healthy leg fully; nevertheless he does not bend it without pain, which is in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot on it forwards: and his urine is retained, and his groin swells, and when walking he treads on his heel.
And the sign of him who has suffered a dislocation backwards is that he does not extend the knee, nor can he bend it before he bends the groin: and his leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the location of the ilium.
The reduction, however, of this kind of dislocation is that you then consider, if the dislocation is old, which has now become chronic in the person who has it. Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its disposition: then there is no cure in it at all. Therefore, no attempt at all should be made on it.
But in him whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of dislocation: then hasten to this, that you rotate the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it right and left: for perhaps it will return, and will not need other treatment.
But if it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he should extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage, which is tied on his leg above the knee: and another assistant should extend his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under his armpits. Then he should tie it with a soft bandage over the top of the hip, and hold the end of another bandage.
And its extension should be either from the front part of the groin to the part of the fork, or from the back to the part of the back.
And the extension of all of them should be at the same time, until the patient is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
And this type of extension is a common type of the four types.
If, therefore, the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then every type needs what I will say about its own treatment.
In its proper reduction when the dislocation is inwards, it is necessary that the patient be laid on his healthy side. Then he should place the bandage over the root of the hip, in the part that is between the head of the hip and the place which is under the groin. Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin area to the higher part of the body, to the area of the collarbone.
Then another strong attendant should take his arms and reduce the swollen place of the weakened hip, and extend it outwards with strong extension. Now indeed it returns to its place.
And this type is the easiest of the remaining types of treatment by which this limb is reduced.
But if it gives you trouble, and it does not yield to you at all with this type of treatment: then it is necessary that the two feet of the weakened [patient] be tied together with a strong, soft bandage, above the two heels, and above the two knees: and let the length of each [leg] from its counterpart be the amount of four fingers: and let the weakened leg be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
Then the weakened [patient] should be suspended above the top of a beam, which is in the house: and its length from the ground should be the amount of two arms.
Then order a strong young man to secure the head of the hip: and let another young man be suspended with the weakened [patient]: and let another young man push, securing the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
However, in its proper resetting, when the dislocation is outwards, it is necessary that the weakened [patient] lie on a table, according to what we described in the one having a hump. And let a bandage be tightened on his weakened leg, specifically, and on his chest.
Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head. Then let an additional piece of wood be placed in the middle of the table, firmly fixed: over which damp cloths should be wrapped so that it does not injure the weakened [patient]: and let the piece of wood be between his thighs, so that he is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Then let each assistant extend toward his own side, and the physician guide the reduction with his hand.
If therefore it yields to the resetting, it will be good.
And if not, place him upon the board, and press upon it, just as we have said regarding a hump, evenly. However, it is necessary that the patient lie upon his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is toward the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the patient be extended quickly: and this is according to the same description, upon a platform: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand upon the patient's groin. Then he should squeeze it with the other hand, and with that squeezing, extend it downwards toward the part of the knee.
And if the dislocation is toward the back, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, and be raised above the ground: rather, it is necessary that he be placed upon something hard, just as is necessary if his hip is dislocated outwardly, according to what we have said about his lying upon both hips: and this is with him on his face, and the ligaments extended, according to what we have said just now.
And it is necessary that pressure be applied with a board also upon the place to which the joint protrudes, when the reduction is completed as it should be.
And the sign of its return will not be hidden from you: and it is that you extend the two legs of the patient: and when you see them equal, and the patient flexes his leg and extends it without hesitation: then you will know that the limb has now returned as it should: then join the two thighs, and apply a plaster, and bind with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the hip does not move to either side: and let the patient adhere to rest for three or four days.
Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is now healed: then release the patient to walk.
And if you see any softening, then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Then loosen it and have him delay walking on both for a few days, until he is well strengthened.
Regarding dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways. It is dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and downwards, that is, to the back.
And it is not dislocated to the front.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to bring his leg to his hip. But if it does not connect with the hip, then you know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its manners of dislocation is that you have the patient sit upright, so that he now extends his leg if he can upon it, and your back connects to his face: and you place his foot between your feet.
Then make his knee connect with your palms, and straighten them with your fingers upon his knee. Then press with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength. And let another assistant extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg connects with the hip smoothly, not with difficulty.
Then apply a plaster to it and bind the leg to the hip. Then bandage them together with a band for three or four days. Then loosen them.
And let the patient not walk for several days, until he is healed.
But if its reduction is refused to you, then administer strong extension with bandages, the description of which preceded in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
On the treatment of dislocation of the heel.
The heel bone is sometimes moved a little, and sometimes dislocated completely. And its dislocation occurs either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, extending to the side to which it is dislocated.
The treatment for its displacement is easy to restore: and it is that it be extended gently with the hands and adjusted until it returns (to its place).
In treating it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright: and a very strong assistant should hold him from the back of his back, in the middle of it.
Then you hold with your right hand his foot from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. Then with the left (hand) twice.
Then extend with the left, and push the top of the foot with the right towards the leg without force.
Do this twice, as we have described.
Then push the top of the foot toward the leg on the third time, and you pull the heel.
If, therefore, it returns in one time, or in two according to this method, and you see the foot straightened, it is good: and if not, then repeat the procedure upon it: because it will return.
But if its reduction is prevented for you by that which we have described, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a peg firmly in the ground, so that it falls between his thighs: and you will have already wrapped cloth around it, so that it does not injure the patient.
Then let an assistant take hold of his thigh: afterwards, let another assistant extend the foot, either with his hands, or with a bandage which he binds above the ankle. Then let each assistant extend against the extension of his partner: and let the peg stand between the two thighs of the patient, holding him, so that his body is not drawn downwards at the extension.
Then let the physician correct the dislocation with his hands, and let another assistant hold the healthy leg below. For the dislocation returns quickly.
When therefore the dislocation returns, and the soundness of its reduction is apparent to you, then apply a plaster and tow, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And it is necessary that you take care or beware of the tendons which are above the heel posteriorly, that the bandaging not be too tight upon them, and injure them.
Then leave it for two or three days. But if the bandaging loosens, tighten it: then loosen it on the third or fourth day: and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. If indeed he attempts to walk before that time, there is no assurance that the dislocation will not recur, and become worse, and after that will not receive a cure.
But if a hot abscess happens to him: then it is necessary that you administer for its relief what we have previously described in another place concerning its treatment and fomentation, until it is removed.
Concerning dislocation of the toes, and treatment.
It is necessary that what is dislocated of them be set with a little extension without force: and that indeed is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the top of the foot, then it is necessary that the patient place his foot on a place level with the ground, or on a board: and he stands as if walking.
Then you stand and place your foot upon that which projects from those joints. Then press upon it with your foot forcefully until it returns, and you see it already set, and no protrusion appears in the area.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board which encompasses the whole foot, which has two ends. Then bind it firmly for three days. Then loosen it, and have him abstain from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from relapse.
Concerning the types of dislocation with a wound or fracture.
When any of these things happen, and you attempt its treatment and its restoration, death often results; and because of this no one ought to presume upon the treatment of such a case unless he is skilled in the art, of long experience, compassionate, pious, cautious, not bold, nor presumptuous, and unless he uses, at the beginning, medicines which only soothe hot abscesses; and he should leave the patient to divine judgment. Unless you foresee or hope for recovery from destruction with mildness of the illness, and in which some hope appears. Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
If, therefore, the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that soothes the abscess; and treat the wound with a suitable drying ointment.
But if the dislocation is with a fracture, and separate bone fragments occur, then attempt their removal, and do with it what we have said about simple ailments of this kind in their respective places.
And be cautious according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, as I have previously advised you.
For that is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and safer for your body among those in your time.
