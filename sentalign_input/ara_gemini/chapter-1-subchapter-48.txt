Chapter forty-eight on cauterizing numbness.
When a limb is numb and is treated with medications, ointments, and bandages, but does not heal
then cauterize the numb limb itself with cauterizations according to what the size of the limb necessitates, whether large or small.
And let your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals.
And some numbness that affects the hand and foot may be cauterized in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, so the numbness goes away.
And no one should undertake this except someone who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
